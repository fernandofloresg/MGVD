Solo estuve en \"Metro Manila\" que comprende 15 ciudades con 16 millones de habitantes, de una población total de 90 millones. No pude visitar las bellezas naturales en el norte y en el sur.\\nEn 1564 comenzó la colonización española que duró más de 300 años. Para que los frailes pudiesen identificar a los nativos, les dieron a escoger de una lista de nombres castellanos, que aún hoy perduran en los filipinos y en las calles; pero el castellano no logró sustituir a los dialectos indígenas. Manila floreció con los galeones que intercambiaban especies y mercancías chinas por el oro y plata mexicanos desde el puerto de Acapulco, pero el lucrativo intercambio desapareció a fines del siglo XVIII.\\nHoy casi nadie habla castellano y la influencia norteamericana es evidente\\nLa derrota española en la guerra hispano-cubana-americana provocó la pérdida de Cuba y las Filipinas en 1898. Durante la colonia de EE UU se implantó el inglés como lengua oficial enseñada en las escuelas. La ocupación norteamericana fue interrumpida por la invasión japonesa durante la II Guerra Mundial; en 1945, Manila fue destruida por el bombardeo de MacArthur frente a la fuerte resistencia nipona, causando 150.000 muertes de civiles. Los filipinos alcanzaron la soñada independencia en 1946.\\nHoy, casi nadie habla castellano, aunque la élite educada lo domina. La lengua principal es el tagalo (uno de los 165 dialectos existentes) con palabras españolas mezcladas que muchos filipinos creen que son parte del idioma vernáculo. El inglés es el segundo idioma, pero no todos lo hablan.\\nCasi todo lo relacionado con el comer es en castellano: mesa, silla, cubiertos, cuchillo, cuchara, tenedor, servilleta, merienda, vaso y botella. \"Platos\" típicos son el lechón, el adobo (de cerdo y pollo), la caldereta (de cabra) y el arroz caldo; se conservan tapas, puchero, leche, repollo, calabaza, harina (sin h) y jamón (con h), pan y mantequilla, carne, calamares, patatas, chocolate, limonada, azúcar (asúkal) y manzana, pera, uvas, papaya, melón y pomelo. Partes del hogar y los muebles continúan siendo llamados puerta, ventana, cama, sofá, aparador y escaparate. Los meses y los días de la semana son en castellano. Lo mismo ocurre en la ropa: pantalón, blusa, zapatos, camiseta, calzoncillo, sombrero, corbata y algunas palabras antiguas como chinelas y saya. También las familiares (padre y madre, abuelo y abuela, compadre y comadre), partes del cuerpo (cabeza, mano, brazo, lengua), oficios (carpintero, barbero, dentista, mecánico, basurero, juez, sastre, capitán), religión (iglesia, católico, Dios, Virgen María), negocios y servicios (botica, banco, hacienda, cementerio), animales (toro, caballo, pato) y flores (rosas, jazmín).\\nSe pide \"permiso\", una característica nacional es el \"amor propio\", los hombres tienen \"queridas\" pero no se usa \"queridos\", y hay \"guapos\" pero no \"guapas\" (a pesar de la aparente inequidad de género ha habido dos \"presidentas\"). Si uno está \"aburrido\" se va a una \"fiesta\", toma un \"café\" o una \"cerveza\" San Miguel y se despide con un \"adiós\".\\nEn la ciudad colonial (\"Intramuros\") perduran las murallas casi intactas, el Fuerte de Santiago que domina el río, la iglesia de San Agustín (la más antigua del país), el manuscrito del héroe nacional José Rizal El último adiós y una mansión reconstruida (Casa Manila) con bellísimos muebles antiguos de rejilla y estupenda cerámica española. El Museo Ayala tiene la mejor colección de oro que he visto, y el Museo del Pueblo Filipino exhibe los restos del galeón San Diego hundido en 1600 con un centenar de piezas de vajilla española.\\nFilipinas es una sociedad multiétnica, gran parte de la población es de descendencia china, y muchos son ricos. Los dos hoteles más lujosos son el Sangri-la y el Mandarín. Chinatown se extiende dos kilómetros, flanqueada por dos puertas chinas, y atiborrada de establecimientos de todo tipo. El enorme cementerio chino está lleno de \"apartamentos\", muchos de dos pisos, con aire acondicionado, cocina y baño. Para el día de difuntos los familiares van en la víspera, duermen en el piso superior, y al día siguiente preparan sus comidas y juegan al dominó o al majong frente a las tumbas de sus antepasados.\\nLa influencia norteamericana es evidente, la comida rápida (McDonald\\'s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin Donuts) ya está creando obesidad. El pasatiempo en Manila es el malling, pues el calor es abrumador y los malls tienen aire refrigerado. En Makati (el centro de negocios y de los grandes hoteles), el Greenbelt Mall se compone de cinco edificios inmensos, conectados por jardines tropicales, tiendas de marcas famosas y docenas de restaurantes.\\nEl tráfico en Manila es horroroso (peor que en Ciudad México). Una distancia corta que el domingo se recorre en taxi en 20 minutos, toma una hora y media durante días de trabajo. El vehículo más popular es el jeepney, un híbrido con frente de jeep y alargado atrás para dar cabida a 16 pasajeros. Hay un tren elevado, siempre abarrotado, y los buses grandes son escasos.\\nLos filipinos son muy amables y corteses. Un gesto común de bienvenida es llevarse la mano derecha al corazón o una pequeña reverencia. A pesar de sus penurias lucen risueños y aman las \"fiestas\" y la música.\\nCarmelo Mesa-Lago es catedrático de Economía y Estudios Latinoamericanos en la Universidad de Pittsburgh (Estados Unidos).\\n* Este artículo apareció en la edición impresa del Martes, 18 de octubre de 2011\\nArchivado en:\\n', 10]\n",

Ciria-Cruz, Pacific News Service\\nPublished 4:00\\xa0am, Monday, July 26, 2004\\nAn old man talking to himself again\\nAmerican officials, several of their allies and many U.S. media criticized Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo \\'s decision to recall her nation\\'s small military contingent in Iraq in order to save the life of Filipino hostage Angelo dela Cruz . They called the move cowardly and said it sent terrorists \"the wrong signal.\"\\nFor most of dela Cruz\\'s compatriots, however, and from the standpoint of their national interest, it was a sensible, even courageous move. There was more at stake in Arroyo\\'s decision to pull out of Iraq than saving the life of an unfortunate hostage or avoiding the ire of the U.S. government, a key source of foreign aid for the Philippines. The hostage crisis imperiled a crucial survival mechanism for the impoverished nation -- the gainful employment of millions of overseas Filipino workers in the Middle East. Some 2 million Filipinos work in the region, with nearly a million in Saudi Arabia alone, according to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs .\\nThese large contingents of Filipino workers have become a critical prop of the Philippine economy. They represent the millions who can\\'t find work in their own country. They send home some $8 billion a year (remittances were largely responsible for a 4.5 percent GNP growth in 2002), providing otherwise income-strapped families the spending power that keeps the economy afloat. A number of Filipinos have been among the unintended victims of suicide bombings in Israel, and a number were killed in recent attacks on foreigners working for American firms in Saudi Arabia.\\nFor Arroyo to insist on remaining in the so-called \"coalition of the willing,\" despite the terrorists\\' threats, would have exposed all Filipinos in the region to a dramatically higher level of danger -- where they are transformed into deliberate targets of terror because their government persists in giving political cover to Bush\\'s \"coalition\" by keeping a symbolic military contingent in Iraq.\\nIn such an eventuality, the mass return of millions of Filipino workers evading terrorist attacks in the Middle East would mean disaster for the Philippine economy. The Philippine government is simply not prepared to absorb a sudden influx of jobless returnees. The large-scale repatriation of Filipinos from the Middle East also would mean trouble for many Arab countries -- including some of America\\'s allies -- that have come to depend on imported Filipino labor or expertise for a multitude of tasks, from domestic work to construction and management. There can be no doubt that President Arroyo\\'s decision to pull out of Iraq to protect other Filipinos was quietly encouraged by many an Arab host government.\\nClearly, Arroyo\\'s decision was also politically self-serving, given the popular outcry for dela Cruz\\'s safe return. Overseas Filipino workers -- an estimated 8 million labor in 150 countries -- risk their lives and endure long absences from their families. They\\'re often called modern-day heroes by Filipino officials and media alike. In 1995, President Fidel Ramos \\' popularity plunged when he failed to save the life of Flor Contemplacion, a domestic worker who was hanged by the government of Singapore on a questionable murder conviction. Dela Cruz\\'s kidnapping brought back memories of that execution, and the political danger was not lost on Arroyo. She had just assumed office after a bitter election whose credibility is held in doubt. Failure to bring back dela Cruz alive would have given her enemies effective ammunition in a poisonous political climate rife with talk of destabilization plots.\\nFor most Filipino opinion-makers -- and from the standpoint of the Philippines\\' national interest -- pulling out of Iraq was not a \"wrong signal\" to terrorists. The wrong signal was to send a troop contingent to begin with, which only served to militarize the longstanding and purely civilian Filipino presence in the Middle East and made it a likely target of terrorist attacks.\\nAs for Washington\\'s implied threat of leaving the Philippines at the mercy of its homegrown terrorists, it\\'s empty and face-saving. The Philippines remains the most important staging area for U.S. operations against al Qaeda\\'s affiliates in Southeast Asia, as predominantly Muslim Indonesia and Malaysia are less than ideal hosts. In fact, several U.S. military exercises are set to take place in Southern Philippines.

As all of Nepomuceno\\'s films are lost, most of the information was gathered from old newspaper articles on microfilm in different archives in Manila. Many of these articles were hitherto undiscovered. Nepomuceno made silent films at a time when the influence of the new coloniser, United States, was growing, and the Spanish language was what unified the intellectual opposition. Previous research on Nepomuceno has focused on the Hispanic influences on his filmmaking, as well as his connections to the stage drama. This paper argues that Nepomuceno created a national consciousness by making films showing native lives and environments, adapting important Filipino novels and plays to the screen and covering important political topics and thereby creating public opinion. Many reviews in the newspapers connected his films to nation-building and independence, as the creation of a national consciousness is a cornerstone in the process of building a nation and defining \"Filipino\". Furthermore, the films of Nepomuceno helped spreading the Tagalog culture and language to other parts of the Philippines, hence making Tagalog the foundation of the national Filipino language.\\nPlace, publisher, year, edition, pages\\n2006. , 75 p.\\nAsia, the Philippines, film history, history, nation, culture, identity, Nepomuceno, colonisation, language, archive studies\\nNational Category\\n', 24]\n",

In 2000, roughly one-third of the population (nearly 27 million Filipinos) lacked the roughly US$275 required annually to satisfy food and non-food basic needs, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) estimates. Such poverty, exacerbated by prolonged El Niño-induced drought and the residual effects of the 1997/1998 financial crisis that shook the region, limits the ability of the poor to gain access to health and other services.\\nThe Philippines is also among the world's fastest urbanizing countries, and overcrowded cities present their own challenges. With some 47 percent of the population living in urban areas, compared with 31 percent in Thailand and 16 percent in Cambodia, the country has more than 200 urban areas that have populations of more than 50,000, notes the country's Commission on Population (POPCOM). By World Bank estimates, these urban centers could expand to some 600 by 2020, largely because high levels of rural poverty are pushing people into the cities.\\nThe concentration of economic development in relatively few urban areas and rapid population growth throughout the country are other factors contributing to urban sprawl. Compared with other countries in the region, the Philippines is experiencing rapid population growth. The rate of natural increase — the birth rate minus the death rate — is 2.2 percent, compared with 0.8 percent in Thailand and Singapore and 1.9 percent in Malaysia.\\nIn addition to fleeing to urban commercial centers, many people leave the country for work. An average of 2,500 Filipinos leave the country every day for work abroad, and the Philippines is second only to Mexico as an exporter of labor. An estimated 10 percent of the country's population, or nearly 8 million people, are overseas Filipino workers distributed in 182 countries, according to POPCOM. That is in addition to the estimated 3 million migrants who work illegally abroad. According to official statistics of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, Filipino workers abroad sent home US$6.8 billion in 1999 alone. A large proportion of these remittances come from women who are the majority of overseas Filipino workers.\\n\\xa0\\n\", 205]\n",

Traditionally, the foreign population in the Philippines consists of people of Chinese origin (some 80 percent of overseas Chinese are in Southeast Asia) and some people of Indian origin who came to settle in the country years ago.\\nPresently, there are 36,150 foreign nationals working and residing in the Philippines. The inflows of foreigners to the country, as well as concerns for unauthorized migration and the use of the Philippines as a transit point for other destinations, point to a reality in this age of migration: that countries can no longer be neatly and exclusively classified as countries of origin, transit, or destination.\\nMuch of the country\\'s attention and policies, though, are focused on emigration. A film released in June 2005, La Visa Loca, captures an ordinary Filipino\\'s feverish quest for a U.S. visa, the perceived ticket to a better life. In reality, the quest for a visa is not limited to the United States. Other promised lands in different regions — the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Oceania — have become the objects of Filipino dreams.\\nIn the last 30 years, a \"culture of migration\" has emerged, with millions of Filipinos eager to work abroad, despite the risks and vulnerabilities they are likely to face. A nationwide survey of 1,200 adult respondents in 2002 found one in five Filipinos expressing a desire to migrate.\\nMore recent surveys carried out by Pulse Asia in 2005 found an increasing percentage of adult respondents — 26 percent in July and 33 percent in October — agreeing with the statement, \"If it were only possible, I would migrate to another country and live there.\" Interest in leaving the country is not limited to adults. In a nationwide survey in 2003 of children ages 10 to 12, 47 percent reported that they wished to work abroad someday. Sixty percent of children of overseas foreign workers said they had plans to work abroad.\\nThe development of a culture of migration in the Philippines has been greatly aided by migration\\'s institutionalization. The government facilitates migration, regulates the operations of the recruitment agencies, and looks out for the rights of its migrant workers. More importantly, the remittances workers send home have become a pillar of the country\\'s economy.\\nHistorical Background\\nAfter more than three centuries of Spanish colonial rule, the revolution waged by Filipinos in 1896 almost led to the end of Spanish rule. After a year of fighting, the revolutionaries and the Spanish authorities signed a truce in December 1897, and General Emilio Aguinaldo went into exile in Hong Kong.\\nThe Spanish-American War broke out in February 1898, sparked by the United States\\' support for Cuba\\'s fight against Spain. This spilled over into the Philippines. An American fleet led by Admiral George Dewey arrived in Manila, defeating Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898.\\nUpon the urging of Admiral Dewey to resume the fight against Spain, General Aguinaldo returned to Manila on May 18, 1898. General Aguinaldo\\'s forces liberated several towns south of Manila and declared independence from Spain on June 12, 1898. More American forces arrived, and the Spaniards surrendered Manila to the Americans that August.\\nOn December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed between the United States and Spain, formally ending the Spanish-American War. Under the treaty, the United States paid Spain to take control of the Philippines. Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Mariana Islands were ceded to the United States as well.\\nFilipinos resisted American rule, and the ensuing Philippine-American War, which began in 1899, dragged on even after it \"officially\" ended with the capture of General Aguinaldo in 1901, followed by the establishment of a civil government throughout the Philippines in 1902. The Philippines became independent in July 1946, after the Japanese invasion and occupation of World War II.\\nFor much of the 20th century, \"international migration\" for Filipinos meant going to the United States and its Pacific territories. The first batch of Filipino workers arrived in the U.S. territory of Hawaii on December 20, 1906 to work on sugarcane and pineapple plantations.\\nMore workers, mostly single men, followed; others left Hawaii to work in agriculture in California, Washington, and Oregon, or the salmon canneries of Alaska. On the mainland, low-wage service work in the cities — waiters, busboys, or domestic work — provided alternative jobs between agricultural seasons or when other jobs are not available. Some 4,000 Filipinos were employed in the merchant marine, but this employment possibility ceased with the 1937 passage of a law requiring the crew of U.S. flag vessels to be at least 90 percent American citizens.\\nAccording to one estimate, approximately 120,000 Filipino workers came to Hawaii between 1906 and 1934. Another estimate puts the number of Filipinos arriving in the United States between 1907 and the 1930 at 150,000, the majority of whom were in Hawaii. A small number of scholars, known as pensionados, also immigrated to the United States before the 1920s. They were either sponsored by the U.S. government or by missionary-related programs. Some were sent by rich families to study and a few were self-supporting students. Those who returned assumed important positions in Filipino society while others remained in the United States.\\nBecause the Philippines was a U.S. colony, the movement of Filipinos to the United States was considered internal migration and Filipino migrants were \"nationals\" (but not citizens). It was not until the passage of the 1934 Tydings-McDuffie Law (also known as the Philippines Independence Act of 1934), which provided for the granting of Philippine independence in 10 years\\' time, that the Philippines became subject to immigration quotas. The 1934 law limited the Philippines to 50 visas per year, and migration dropped off dramatically.\\nBut even so, there was an exception clause: in case of a labor shortage, the governor of Hawaii was authorized to hire Filipino workers. As nationals, Filipinos were entitled to American passports and could enter and leave the country freely. World War II intervened and further migration to the United States stalled. Between 1946 and the mid 1960s, about 10,000 to 12,000 Filipinos came to Hawaii as workers, military personnel, and war brides.\\nIt was not until the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, when nationality-based restrictions were struck down, that Filipino immigration grew and diversified.\\nOther countries of settlement also dismantled their pro-European immigration policies in the 1960s and 1970s, paving the way for Filipinos to enter Canada, Australia, and New Zealand under family or skills-based provisions. The Philippines eventually became one of the top 10 sending countries in these traditional immigration countries.\\nFilipinos also settled in countries that are not traditional countries of immigration, such as Germany and Japan, through marriage or work-related migration. This permanent migration, however, was overshadowed by the larger and thornier temporary labor migration that started in the 1970s.\\nBecoming a Labor Exporter\\nThe Philippines\\' ascent as a major labor exporter in Asia and worldwide is based on various factors. When large-scale labor migration from the Philippines started in the 1970s, the \"push\" factors were very strong but made worse by the oil crisis in 1973. Among others, economic growth could not keep up with population growth. The country was hard pressed to provide jobs and decent wages and had severe balance of payment problems.\\nAt the same time, the oil-rich Gulf countries needed workers to realize their ambitious infrastructure projects. With supply and demand factors converging, the Philippines was ripe for large-scale labor migration, an opportunity the Marcos government recognized. The framework for what became the government\\'s overseas employment program was established with the passage of the Labor Code of the Philippines in 1974.\\nThe Philippines\\' foray into organized international labor migration was supposed to be temporary, lasting only until the country recovered from its economic problems. However, the continuing demand for workers in the Gulf countries and the opening of new labor markets in other regions, especially in East and Southeast Asia, fueled further migration.\\nOn the supply side, the push factors have not abated. The absence of sustained economic development, political instability, a growing population, double-digit unemployment levels, and low wages continue to compel people to look abroad.\\nThe flow of overseas foreign workers (OFWs), numbering a few thousand per year in the early 1970s, has grown to hundreds of thousands (see Table 1). In 2004 alone, 933,588 OFWs left the country. Based on trends, it is expected that the number of deployed OFWs will hit the one million mark in 2005.\\nTable 1. Annual Deployment of Filipino Workers, 1975-2004*\\nYear\\n229,002\\n933,588\\n*Figures for 1975 to 1983 refer to number of contracts processed; figures for 1984 to 2004 refer to number of workers deployed abroad.\\nSources: Table 5 (Battistella, 1995:265) for figures from 1975 to 1983; available online for figures from 1983 to 2003; and for 2004 data . Internet sources were accessed on 12 September 2005.\\nThe data on deployed workers include seafarers, who account for some 20 percent of all OFWs leaving the country every year (see Table 2). Filipinos dominate the industry: 25 percent of the world\\'s seafarers are from the Philippines.\\nTable 2. Regional Distribution of Land-based Overseas Filipino Workers, 2004*\\nRegion\\n704,586\\n100.00\\n*Based on combined data for new hires and rehires. Source: Available online , accessed 12 September 2005.\\nAs of December 2004, the stock of overseas Filipinos include some 3.2 million permanent settlers (the majority of whom are in the United States), about 3.6 million temporary labor migrants (called OFWs), with Saudi Arabia hosting close to a million, and an estimated 1.3 million migrants in an unauthorized situation. The latter tend to be mostly in the United States and Malaysia.\\nWomen are very visible in international migration from the Philippines. They not only compose the majority of permanent settlers, i.e., as part of family migration, but they are as prominent as men in labor migration. In fact, since 1992, female migrants outnumbered men among the newly hired land-based workers who are legally deployed every year.\\nThe majority of female OFWs are in domestic work and entertainment. Since these are unprotected sectors, female migration has raised many concerns about the safety and well-being of women migrants. Female OFWs can also be found in factory work, sales, and nursing.\\nAmong the top 10 destinations of OFWs, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Singapore, Italy, United Arab Emirates, Japan, and Taiwan are dominated by women OFWs. In Hong Kong, for example, more than 90 percent of OFWs are women (Table 2).\\nHow Labor Export Works\\nWith its low rate of foreign investment and a steady reduction in development assistance, the government, not just its people, has come to rely on overseas employment as a strategy for survival. After years of pushing the official line that it does not promote overseas employment, the government set a target in 2001 of deploying a million workers overseas every year, a goal it is likely to meet in 2005.\\nSince the 1970s, the government and the private sector each have played a role in the labor export process. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) grew out of the Overseas Employment Development Board and the National Seamen Board in the then Ministry of Labor and Employment. POEA became the government agency responsible for processing workers\\' contracts and predeployment checks, as well as for licensing, regulating, and monitoring private recruitment agencies.\\nWhen the overseas program started, the government participated in recruiting and matching workers and employers. Due to demand for workers and the large numbers involved, the government relinquished the placement of workers to private recruitment agencies in 1976. There is a placement branch within the POEA, but it only accounts for a small number of all OFWs placed with foreign employers.\\nOn the private-sector side, there are more than 1,000 government-licensed recruitment and manning agencies in the Philippines (and an unknown number of unlicensed ones) that match workers with foreign employers. In the Philippines, recruitment agencies refer to those that find jobs for aspiring land-based migrant workers; manning agencies refer to those that engage in recruiting and finding jobs for seafarers.\\nRecruitment agencies charge migrant workers \"placement fees\" for the service that they provide. Manning agencies are not supposed to charge placement fees as these fees are assumed by the principal or employer, but there are cases of known violations.\\nAlthough there is a standard placement fee for most destinations (except for special markets such as Taiwan) which is equivalent to one month\\'s salary plus 5,000 Philippine pesos (about US$94) for documentation, this is routinely violated. The excessive fees are a burden to migrants and put them in a vulnerable situation because they are already in debt before they leave. When they are abroad, they go without any salary for a period of time, and they are forced to bear harsh working and living conditions in order to repay their loans.\\nAnother government agency, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), provides support and assistance to migrants and their families. All processes and requirements up until the point of departure are handled by the POEA, while the OWWA assumes responsibility for the workers\\' welfare while they are employed abroad. POEA and OWWA are under the Department of Labor and Employment.\\nA separate agency, the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO), provides programs and services to permanent emigrants. CFO was transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Office of the President in 2004.\\nAmong the countries of origin in Asia, the Philippines offers a fairly comprehensive package of programs and services covering all phases of migration, from predeparture to on-site services to return and reintegration. Although the government could improve its implementation of these programs, the programs demonstrate the government\\'s efforts to balance the marketing of workers with protection.\\nSome of these initiatives, such as the predeparture orientation seminars for departing workers and the deployment of labor attachés and welfare officers to countries with large OFW populations, are good practices that other countries of origin have also implemented.\\nProtecting Workers Abroad\\nThe irregular operations of recruitment agencies in the Philippines and their counterparts in the countries of destination are one of the sources of vulnerabilities for migrant workers. Excessive placement fees, contract substitution, nonpayment or delayed wages, and difficult working and living conditions are common problems encountered by migrant workers, including legal ones.\\nMigrant women face particular vulnerabilities. Aside from the usual problems that plague migrants, their jobs in domestic work and entertainment usually mean long working hours, surveillance and control by employers, and abusive conditions, including violence and sexual harassment. Given the \"private\" context in which they work, the problems encountered by migrant women in these sectors go unnoticed.\\nIn general, compared to other national groups, Filipino workers are relatively better protected because they are more educated, more likely to speak English, and they are better organized. NGOs for migrants in the Philippines and their networks abroad not only provide services and support to migrants, but, more importantly, they advocate for migrants\\' rights\\nThe development of a legal and institutional framework to promote migrant workers\\' protection is also an important factor. The Philippines was the first among the countries of origin in Asia to craft a law that aims \"to establish a higher standard of protection and promotion of the welfare of migrant workers, their families and overseas Filipinos in distress.\" Although there had been discussions about a Magna Charta for migrant workers for some time, it was not until 1995 that the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act (also known as Republic Act or RA8042) was finally passed.\\nThe tipping point was the national furor in 1995 over the execution of Flor Contemplación, a domestic worker in Singapore, who many Filipinos believed was innocent despite her conviction for the deaths of her Singaporean ward and another Filipino domestic worker. This was a factor in fast-tracking the passage of RA8042.\\nBriefly, the law\\'s provisions include:\\nthe deployment of workers in countries that ensure protection, including the banning of deployment if necessary;\\nproviding support and assistance to overseas Filipinos, whether legal or in an unauthorized situation;\\nimposing stiff penalties for illegal recruiters;\\nfree legal assistance and witness protection program for victims of illegal recruitment;\\nthe institution of advisory/information, repatriation, and reintegration services;\\nthe stipulation that the \"protection of Filipino migrant workers and the promotion of their welfare, in particular, and the protection of the dignity and fundamental rights and freedoms of the Filipino abroad, in general, shall be the his/her priority concerns of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Foreign Service Posts;\"\\nthe establishment of the Migrant Workers and Other Overseas Filipinos Resource Centers in countries where there are large numbers of Filipinos;\\nand the creation of the Legal Assistant for Migrant Workers Affairs (now the Office of the Undersecretary of Migrant Workers Affairs) and the Legal Assistance Fund.\\nThe haste with which RA8042 was passed has resulted in some problematic provisions, leading to calls for amendments. For example, in the Declaration of Policies, it is mentioned that \"the State does not promote overseas employment as a means to sustain economic growth and achieve national development.\" Some sectors, such as the NGO community, believe the state does promote labor migration.\\nOne controversial provision is Section 29, which deals with the deregulation of recruitment activities. If this were implemented, the regulatory functions of the POEA would have been phased out in 2001, that is, within five years of the law becoming effective. NGOs are against the deregulation plan because the playing field already is highly uneven. The recruitment agencies, on the other hand, are pushing for deregulation.\\nOverall, RA8042 has not been a complete failure. Some provisions have been implemented well (e.g., there are various information programs in place); some need to be fine-tuned, notably programs dealing with returning migrants and their reintegration in the local economy. There are also moves to amend certain sections of the law.\\nThe Office of the Undersecretary of Migrant Workers Affairs, under the Department of Foreign Affairs, provides assistance to migrant workers who encounter legal problems abroad, while the National Labor Relations Council handles employment-related problems such as money claims.\\nIn addition to government initiatives, the efforts of NGOs, church-based organizations, and migrants\\' organizations, as well as transnational and international efforts directed at promoting and protecting migrants\\' rights, help provide an \"antidote\" to the dangers of migration.\\nAmong the countries of origin in Asia, the Philippines is also a leader in introducing several migration-related laws. These include:\\nthe Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, which establishes policies and institutional mechanisms to provide support to trafficked persons;\\nthe Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003, which gives qualified overseas Filipinos the right to vote in national elections; and\\nthe Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003, which allows for dual citizenship.\\nIn terms of commitments to international norms and standards concerning migrants, the Philippines is one of 34 countries (as of October 27, 2005) that has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families. It is also one of 95 countries (as of November 6, 2005) that has ratified the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.\\nRemittances\\nAside from easing unemployment, Filipinos who choose to work abroad send home remittances that have become an important pillar of the Philippine economy (see Table 3). In 2004, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, remittances sent through formal channels amounted to US$8.5 billion. In 2005, remittances are expected to reach US$10 billion.\\nTable 3.

Each barkada is either all male or all female. Members develop their own slang and go almost everywhere together.\\nThe country's most popular sport is basketball; in 1954, the country was placed third in the World Basketball Championship. Men and boys play the game in school gyms and neighbourhood streets. Filipino players have excelled at the sport and become the top players in Asia. Crowds flock to watch professional teams compete in the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Filipinos have also excelled at boxing, with athletes winning international competitions. Flyweight boxer Mansuetto Onyok Velasco took a silver medal at the 1996 Olympics.\\nA common form of handball, jai alai, has recently declined in popularity and been banned at the professional level due to gambling. In the game, players bounce a hard rubber ball off one end of a court and catch the ball in a small basket (cesta) tied to their hand. Sipa, popular with adults and children, is a type of volleyball that uses a rattan ball; players must drive the ball over a net using only their legs, body and feet.

People also enjoy bowling.\\nFilipinos enthusiastic about games such mahjongg, a Chinese game played with 144 tiles. Chess, checkers, dama (a type of draughts) and dominos are also very popular and often played on street corners. In 1992, the Philippines hosted the World Chess Olympics; the country has many top players, including grandmasters Eugenio Torre and Rosendo Balinas Jr. The most popular form of entertainment among men, however, is cockfighting.

      "[0.0014291029681928488, 'Source: Philippine Statistics Authority [3]\\nEthnologue lists 186 individual languages in the Philippines, 182 of which are living languages, while 4 no longer have any known speakers. Most native languages are part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages , which is itself a branch of the Austronesian language family . [410] The only language not classified as an Austronesian language is Chavacano which is a creole language of Mexican-Spanish and is classified as a Romance language . [425]\\nFilipino and English are the official languages of the country. [12] Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog , spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English are used in government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides for the promotion of Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. [12] Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. [426] However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages. [427]\\nNineteen regional languages act as auxiliary official languages used as mediums of instruction: Aklanon , Bikol , Cebuano , Chavacano , Hiligaynon , Ibanag , Ilocano , Ivatan , Kapampangan , Kinaray-a , Maguindanao , Maranao , Pangasinan , Sambal , Surigaonon , Tagalog, Tausug , Waray , and Yakan . [2] Other indigenous languages such as, Cuyonon , Ifugao , Itbayat , Kalinga , Kamayo , Kankanaey , Masbateño , Romblomanon , Malay , and several Visayan languages are prevalent in their respective provinces. [428]\\nLanguages not indigenous to the islands are also taught in select schools. Mandarin is used in Chinese schools catering to the Chinese Filipino community. Islamic schools in Mindanao teach Modern Standard Arabic in their curriculum. [429] French , German , Japanese , Korean , and Spanish are taught with the help of foreign linguistic institutions. [430] The Department of Education began teaching the Malay languages of Indonesian and Malaysian in 2013. [431]\\nReligion\\nMain article: Religion in the Philippines\\nLoay Church\\nThe Philippines is an officially secular state , although Christianity is the dominant faith. [432] Census data from 2010 found that about 80.58% of the population professed Catholicism . [4] Around 37% regularly attend Mass and 29% identify as very religious. [433] [434] Protestants are 10.8% [435] [436] of the total population, mostly endorsing Evangelical Protestant denominations that were introduced by American missionaries at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, they are heavily concentrated in Northern Luzon and Southern Mindanao. [437] [438] The Philippine Independent Church is a notable independent Catholic denomination. [439] [440] [441] Iglesia ni Cristo is a notable Restorationist denomination in the country. [442] [443]\\nIslam is the second largest religion. The Muslim population of the Philippines was reported as 5.57% of the total population according to census returns in 2010, [4] although a 2012 report by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos estimates it at 11%. [444] The majority of Muslims live in the Bangsamoro region . [445] [446] [447] [448] Most practice Sunni Islam under the Shafi\\'i school . [449] [450]\\nAn unknown number of Filipinos are irreligious , but they may form as much as 10% of the population. [451] [452] Catholicism\\'s historic dominance is steadily declining, with about 9% of adherents considering leaving their church. [453]\\nAn estimated 2% of the total population practice Philippine traditional religions , whose practices and folk beliefs are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam. [443] [454] Buddhism is practiced by around 2% of the population, and is concentrated among Filipinos of Chinese descent. [443] [449] [454] The remaining population is divided between a number of religious groups, including Hindus , Jews , and Baha\\'is . [455]\\nHealth\\nThe façade of the Bonifacio Global City branch of St. Luke\\'s Medical Center\\nThere are an increasing number of private health providers and, as of 2009 [update] , 67.1% of healthcare came from private expenditures while 32.9% was from government. In 2013, total expenditures on the health sector was 3.8% of GDP, below the WHO target of 5%. [456] Health expenditure represented about 6.1% of total government spending. Per capita total expenditure at average exchange rate was USD52. [457] The budget allocation for Healthcare in 2010 was ₱28\\xa0billion (about USD597\\xa0million) or ₱310 ($7) per person [458] but had an increase in budget in 2014 with a record high in the collection of taxes from the House Bill 5727 (commonly known as Sin tax Bill).

[457] Retention of skilled practitioners is a problem. 70% of nursing graduates go overseas to work. The Philippines is the biggest supplier of nurses for export. [460]\\nIn 2001 there were about 1,700 hospitals , of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private. Cardiovascular diseases account for more than 25% of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite the increase of HIV/AIDS cases from 12,000 in 2005 [461] to 17,450 as of April 2014 with 5,965 people who were under anti-retroviral therapy, [462] the country is still a low-HIV-prevalence country with less than 0.1% of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive. [463]\\nEducation\\nMain article: Education in the Philippines\\nThe University of Santo Tomas , established in 1611, has the oldest extant university charter in Asia.\\nThe Philippines has a simple literacy rate of 95.6%, with 95.1% for males and 96.1% for females. The Philippines had a functional literacy rate of 86.45%, with 84.2% for males and 88.7% for females in 2008. [464] [465] Spending on education accounted for 16.11% in the national budget proposed for 2015. [466] [467]\\nThe Commission on Higher Education (CHED) lists 2,180 higher education institutions, 607 of which are public and 1,573 private. [468] Classes start in June and end in March. The majority of colleges and universities follow a semester calendar from June to October and November to March. There are a number of foreign schools with study programs. [218] A 6-year elementary and 4-year high school education is mandatory [469] with an additional two years being added in 2013. [470] [471]\\nSeveral government agencies are involved with education. The Department of Education covers elementary, secondary, and non-formal education. The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) administers post-secondary, middle-level education training and development. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) supervises college and graduate academic programs and degrees as well as regulates standards in higher education. [472]\\nIn 2004, madaris were mainstreamed in 16 regions nationwide, mainly in Muslim areas in Mindanao under the auspices and program of the Department of Education. [473] Public universities are all non-sectarian entities, and are further classified as State Universities and Colleges (SUC) or Local Colleges and Universities (LCU). [468] The University of the Philippines , a system of eight (8) constituent universities, is the national university system of the Philippines. [474]\\nCulture\\nA participant of the Ati-Atihan Festival .\\nPhilippine culture is a combination of Eastern and Western cultures . The Philippines exhibits aspects found in other Asian countries with a Malay [475] heritage, yet its culture also displays a significant number of Spanish and American influences. Traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas (district festivals) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common, these community celebrations are times for feasting, music, and dancing. The Ati-Atihan , Moriones and Sinulog festivals are a couple of the most well-known.\\nSome traditions, however, are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization. The Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the Philippines. They are famed for their iconic performances of Philippine dances such as the tinikling and singkil that both feature clashing bamboo poles. [476]\\nOne of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua , which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population. [477] The names of many streets, towns, and provinces are also in Spanish.\\nThe common use of the English language is an example of the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends. This affinity is seen in Filipinos\\' love of fast food and American film and music. Fast food outlets are found on many street corners. American global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market, but local fast food chains like Goldilocks and most notably Jollibee , the leading fast food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals. [478] [479]\\nArchitecture\\nMain article: Architecture of the Philippines\\nColonial houses in Vigan .\\nSpanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor, but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II. [58] Some examples remain, mainly among the country\\'s churches, government buildings, and universities. Four Philippine baroque churches are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the San Agustín Church in Manila, Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte , Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (Santa María) Church in Ilocos Sur , and Santo Tomás de Villanueva Church in Iloilo . [480] Vigan in Ilocos Sur is also known for the many Hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there. [481]\\nThe American occupation in 1898 introduced a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila . Part of the Burnham\\'s plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture . [482] In Iloilo , a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American occupation in the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real . [483]\\nHowever, certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate. Limestones and coral were used as building materials. [484] Idjangs or Ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the Spanish conquest of the whole Philippines. [485]\\nMusic\\nMain articles: Music of the Philippines and Original Pilipino Music\\nPercussion instruments that make up the Philippine kulintang ensemble, an example of pre-Hispanic musical tradition\\nPhilippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. Some examples of this tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T\\'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao . This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang .\\nDuring the Spanish era Rondalya music, where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals. [486]\\nMarcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) were some of the recognized musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. [487] [488] However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers . [489]\\nDance\\nTinikling dancers.\\nJust like the evolution of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga .\\nUniversal dances in the Philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals, mimicry, life cycle and parties. During the Spanish era, most dances are accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well.\\nOne famous dance that is well known is called the Tinikling , where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles. It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about \"How rural townsfolk mingle\". The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides. The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the Singkil . [490] Nowadays, in the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few. [491]\\nVisual art\\nThe Spoliarium (1884) by Juan Luna .\\nPottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5\\xa0BC to 225\\xa0AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods. [492] [493]\\nEarly Philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu . The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos\\' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery. [494]\\nPaintings of early modernist painters such as Damián Domingo often still had a religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.\\nIn the modern period, the integration of architecture in the Art Deco style happened. Many of these examples can be seen in statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces. [495]\\nValues\\nFurther information: Filipino values\\nAs a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity ), and commercial relationships. [496]\\nFilipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. [497] The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of \"Hiya\", roughly translated as \\'a sense of shame\\', and \"Amor propio\" or \\'self-esteem\\'. [497] Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos. [498]\\nOther elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery. [499]\\nCuisine\\nLeft-to-right: Lumpia , Adobo , Halo-halo and Sisig .\\nFilipino cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic , Chinese , American , and other Asian influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas. [479] [500]\\nPopular dishes include lechón , adobo , sinigang , kare-kare , tapa , crispy pata , pancit , lumpia , and halo-halo . Some common local ingredients used in cooking are calamansi , coconuts, saba (a kind of short wide plantain ), mangoes , ube , milkfish , and fish sauce . Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors. [479] [500]\\nUnlike many of their Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork. [501]\\nThe traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan (using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth) [502] was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas. [503] However, due to the various Filipino restaurants that introduced Filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to Filipino urbanites, kamayan fast became popular. This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the \"Boodle Fight\" concept (as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army), wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and Filipino viands are placed all together for a filial, friendly and/or communal kamayan feasting. [504]\\nLiterature\\nJosé Rizal is a pioneer of Philippine Revolution through his literary works.\\nPhilippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people. While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the aswang , the manananggal , the diwata / engkanto , and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling , Lam-Ang , and the Sarimanok . [505]\\nPhilippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English. Some of the most known were created from the 17th to 19th\\xa0century. Adarna , for example, is a famous epic about an eponymous magical bird allegedly written by José de la Cruz or \"Huseng Sisiw\". [506] Francisco Balagtas , the poet and playwright who wrote Florante at Laura , is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language. José Rizal wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Filibustering, also known as The Reign of Greed). He is considered a national hero. [507] His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule, and his death by firing squad, inspired other Filipino revolutionaries to seek independence. [508] Several Filipino writers were awarded National Artist of the Philippines such as N. V. M. Gonzalez , Amado V. Hernandez , Francisco Arcellana , Nick Joaquín , F. Sionil José and many more.\\nMedia\\nMain articles: Television in the Philippines , Radio in the Philippines , and Philippine drama\\nPhilippine media uses mainly Filipino and English. Other Philippine languages, including various Visayan languages are also used, especially in radio due to its ability to reach remote rural locations that might otherwise not be serviced by other kinds of media. The dominant television networks ABS-CBN , GMA and TV5 also have extensive radio presence. [509]\\nThe entertainment industry is vibrant and feeds broadsheets and tabloids with an unending supply of details about celebrities and sensationalist daily scandals. Drama and fantasy shows are anticipated as are Latin telenovelas , Asianovelas , and anime . Daytime television is dominated by game shows, variety shows, and talk shows such as Eat Bulaga and It\\'s Showtime . [510] Philippine cinema has a long history and is popular domestically, but has faced increasing competition from American , Asian and European films . Critically acclaimed directors and actors include Lino Brocka and Nora Aunor for films like Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag (Manila: In the Claws of Light) and Himala (Miracle). [511] [512] [513] [514] In recent years it has become common to see celebrities flitting between television and movies and then moving into politics provoking concerns. [515]\\nCinema\\nMain article: Cinema of the Philippines\\nBrillante Mendoza is a prominent Filipino film director.\\nSalón de Pertierra was the first introduced moving picture on January 1, 1897 in the Philippines. All films were all in Spanish since Philippine cinema was first introduced during the final years of the Spanish era of the country. Antonio Ramos was the first known movie producer. He used the Lumiere Cinematograph when he filmed Panorama de Manila (Manila landscape), Fiesta de Quiapo (Quiapo Fiesta), Puente de España (Bridge of Spain), and Escenas Callejeras (Street scenes). Meanwhile, Jose Nepomuceno was dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\". [516] Dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\", his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines. [517] His first film produced was entitled Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden) in 1919.\\nFilm showing resumed in 1900 during the American period . Walgrah, a British entrepreneur, opened the Cine Walgrah at No. 60 Calle Santa Rosa in Intramuros . It was also during this time that a movie market was formally created in the country along with the arrival of silent movies. These silent films were always accompanied by gramophone, a piano, a quartet, or a 200-man choir. During the Japanese occupation , filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of Philippine cinema with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures.\\nDuring the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft porn) pictures and an era of musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. [518] The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry. [519] In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.

Most native languages are part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages , which is itself a branch of the Austronesian language family . [410] The only language not classified as an Austronesian language is Chavacano which is a creole language of Mexican-Spanish and is classified as a Romance language . [425]\\nFilipino and English are the official languages of the country. [12] Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog , spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English are used in government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides for the promotion of Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. [12] Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. [426] However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages. [427]\\nNineteen regional languages act as auxiliary official languages used as mediums of instruction: Aklanon , Bikol , Cebuano , Chavacano , Hiligaynon , Ibanag , Ilocano , Ivatan , Kapampangan , Kinaray-a , Maguindanao , Maranao , Pangasinan , Sambal , Surigaonon , Tagalog, Tausug , Waray , and Yakan . [2] Other indigenous languages such as, Cuyonon , Ifugao , Itbayat , Kalinga , Kamayo , Kankanaey , Masbateño , Romblomanon , Malay , and several Visayan languages are prevalent in their respective provinces. [428]\\nLanguages not indigenous to the islands are also taught in select schools. Mandarin is used in Chinese schools catering to the Chinese Filipino community. Islamic schools in Mindanao teach Modern Standard Arabic in their curriculum. [429] French , German , Japanese , Korean , and Spanish are taught with the help of foreign linguistic institutions. [430] The Department of Education began teaching the Malay languages of Indonesian and Malaysian in 2013. [431]\\nReligion\\nMain article: Religion in the Philippines\\nLoay Church\\nThe Philippines is an officially secular state , although Christianity is the dominant faith. [432] Census data from 2010 found that about 80.58% of the population professed Catholicism . [4] Around 37% regularly attend Mass and 29% identify as very religious. [433] [434] Protestants are 10.8% [435] [436] of the total population, mostly endorsing Evangelical Protestant denominations that were introduced by American missionaries at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, they are heavily concentrated in Northern Luzon and Southern Mindanao. [437] [438] The Philippine Independent Church is a notable independent Catholic denomination. [439] [440] [441] Iglesia ni Cristo is a notable Restorationist denomination in the country. [442] [443]\\nIslam is the second largest religion. The Muslim population of the Philippines was reported as 5.57% of the total population according to census returns in 2010, [4] although a 2012 report by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos estimates it at 11%. [444] The majority of Muslims live in the Bangsamoro region . [445] [446] [447] [448] Most practice Sunni Islam under the Shafi\\'i school . [449] [450]\\nAn unknown number of Filipinos are irreligious , but they may form as much as 10% of the population. [451] [452] Catholicism\\'s historic dominance is steadily declining, with about 9% of adherents considering leaving their church. [453]\\nAn estimated 2% of the total population practice Philippine traditional religions , whose practices and folk beliefs are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam. [443] [454] Buddhism is practiced by around 2% of the population, and is concentrated among Filipinos of Chinese descent. [443] [449] [454] The remaining population is divided between a number of religious groups, including Hindus , Jews , and Baha\\'is . [455]\\nHealth\\nThe façade of the Bonifacio Global City branch of St. Luke\\'s Medical Center\\nThere are an increasing number of private health providers and, as of 2009 [update] , 67.1% of healthcare came from private expenditures while 32.9% was from government.

Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals. [486]\\nMarcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) were some of the recognized musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. [487] [488] However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers . [489]\\nDance\\nTinikling dancers.\\nJust like the evolution of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga .\\nUniversal dances in the Philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals, mimicry, life cycle and parties. During the Spanish era, most dances are accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well.\\nOne famous dance that is well known is called the Tinikling , where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles. It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about \"How rural townsfolk mingle\". The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides. The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the Singkil . [490] Nowadays, in the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few. [491]\\nVisual art\\nThe Spoliarium (1884) by Juan Luna .\\nPottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5\\xa0BC to 225\\xa0AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods. [492] [493]\\nEarly Philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu . The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos\\' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery. [494]\\nPaintings of early modernist painters such as Damián Domingo often still had a religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.\\nIn the modern period, the integration of architecture in the Art Deco style happened. Many of these examples can be seen in statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces. [495]\\nValues\\nFurther information: Filipino values\\nAs a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity ), and commercial relationships. [496]\\nFilipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. [497] The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of \"Hiya\", roughly translated as \\'a sense of shame\\', and \"Amor propio\" or \\'self-esteem\\'. [497] Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos. [498]\\nOther elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery. [499]\\nCuisine\\nLeft-to-right: Lumpia , Adobo , Halo-halo and Sisig .\\nFilipino cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic , Chinese , American , and other Asian influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas. [479] [500]\\nPopular dishes include lechón , adobo , sinigang , kare-kare , tapa , crispy pata , pancit , lumpia , and halo-halo . Some common local ingredients used in cooking are calamansi , coconuts, saba (a kind of short wide plantain ), mangoes , ube , milkfish , and fish sauce . Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors. [479] [500]\\nUnlike many of their Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork. [501]\\nThe traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan (using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth) [502] was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas. [503] However, due to the various Filipino restaurants that introduced Filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to Filipino urbanites, kamayan fast became popular. This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the \"Boodle Fight\" concept (as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army), wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and Filipino viands are placed all together for a filial, friendly and/or communal kamayan feasting. [504]\\nLiterature\\nJosé Rizal is a pioneer of Philippine Revolution through his literary works.\\nPhilippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people. While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the aswang , the manananggal , the diwata / engkanto , and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling , Lam-Ang , and the Sarimanok . [505]\\nPhilippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English. Some of the most known were created from the 17th to 19th\\xa0century. Adarna , for example, is a famous epic about an eponymous magical bird allegedly written by José de la Cruz or \"Huseng Sisiw\". [506] Francisco Balagtas , the poet and playwright who wrote Florante at Laura , is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language. José Rizal wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Filibustering, also known as The Reign of Greed). He is considered a national hero. [507] His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule, and his death by firing squad, inspired other Filipino revolutionaries to seek independence. [508] Several Filipino writers were awarded National Artist of the Philippines such as N. V. M. Gonzalez , Amado V. Hernandez , Francisco Arcellana , Nick Joaquín , F. Sionil José and many more.\\nMedia\\nMain articles: Television in the Philippines , Radio in the Philippines , and Philippine drama\\nPhilippine media uses mainly Filipino and English. Other Philippine languages, including various Visayan languages are also used, especially in radio due to its ability to reach remote rural locations that might otherwise not be serviced by other kinds of media. The dominant television networks ABS-CBN , GMA and TV5 also have extensive radio presence. [509]\\nThe entertainment industry is vibrant and feeds broadsheets and tabloids with an unending supply of details about celebrities and sensationalist daily scandals. Drama and fantasy shows are anticipated as are Latin telenovelas , Asianovelas , and anime . Daytime television is dominated by game shows, variety shows, and talk shows such as Eat Bulaga and It\\'s Showtime . [510] Philippine cinema has a long history and is popular domestically, but has faced increasing competition from American , Asian and European films . Critically acclaimed directors and actors include Lino Brocka and Nora Aunor for films like Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag (Manila: In the Claws of Light) and Himala (Miracle). [511] [512] [513] [514] In recent years it has become common to see celebrities flitting between television and movies and then moving into politics provoking concerns. [515]\\nCinema\\nMain article: Cinema of the Philippines\\nBrillante Mendoza is a prominent Filipino film director.\\nSalón de Pertierra was the first introduced moving picture on January 1, 1897 in the Philippines. All films were all in Spanish since Philippine cinema was first introduced during the final years of the Spanish era of the country. Antonio Ramos was the first known movie producer. He used the Lumiere Cinematograph when he filmed Panorama de Manila (Manila landscape), Fiesta de Quiapo (Quiapo Fiesta), Puente de España (Bridge of Spain), and Escenas Callejeras (Street scenes). Meanwhile, Jose Nepomuceno was dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\". [516] Dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\", his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines. [517] His first film produced was entitled Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden) in 1919.\\nFilm showing resumed in 1900 during the American period . Walgrah, a British entrepreneur, opened the Cine Walgrah at No. 60 Calle Santa Rosa in Intramuros . It was also during this time that a movie market was formally created in the country along with the arrival of silent movies. These silent films were always accompanied by gramophone, a piano, a quartet, or a 200-man choir. During the Japanese occupation , filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of Philippine cinema with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures.\\nDuring the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft porn) pictures and an era of musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. [518] The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry. [519] In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.

But there is also a rich underlay   of Malay culture beneath the patina of Spanish and American heritage. National   cultural life is a happy marriage of many influences, as the indigenous Malay   culture is assimilated and adapted to different strains in a practice typical   of Malay temperament. An upsurge of Philippine nationalism stimulated a desire   to preserve the ancient heritage without restricting its openness to foreign   artistic influence.\\nThe Philippines is an archipelago of 7,107 islands. It stretches from the south of China to the northern tip of Borneo. The country has over a hundred ethnic groups and a mixture of foreign influences which have molded a unique Filipino culture.\\nBefore the Spanish explorers came, Indo-Malays and Chinese merchants had settled   here. In 1521, the Spaniards, led by Ferdinand Magellan, discovered the islands.   The Spanish conquistadores established a colonial government in Cebu in 1565.   They transferred the seat of government to Manila in 1571 and proceeded to   colonize the country. The Filipinos resisted and waged Asia\\'s first nationalist   revolution in 1896. On June 12, 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines   independent from Spain and proclaimed himself president. After ruling for 333   years, the Spaniards finally left in 1898 and were replaced by the Americans   who stayed for 48 years. On July 4, 1946, the Americans recognized Philippine   independence.\\nThe Philippines is the third largest English-speaking country in the world.   The country is divided into three geographical areas: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.   It has 17 regions,   81 provinces, 118 cities, 1,510 municipalities , and 41,995 barangays. (Barangay   - The smallest political unit into which cities and municipalities in the Philippines   are divided. It is the basic unit of the Philippine political system. It consists   of less than 1,000 inhabitants residing within the territorial limit of a city   or municipality and administered by a set of elective officials, headed by   a barangay chairman or punong barangay). Data as of December 2006.\\nGEOGRAPHY\\nThe Philippine archipelago is geographically located between latitude (approximately)   4o23\\'N   and  21o25\\'N and longitude (approximately) 112oE and 127oE.   It is composed of 7,107 islands, with a land area of 299,764 sq.kilometers.   Its length measures 1,850 kilometers, starting from the point near the southern   tip of Taiwan and ending close to northern Borneo. Its breadth is about 965   kilometers. The Philippine coastline adds up to 17,500 km. Three prominent   bodies of water surround the archipelago: the Pacific Ocean on the east, the   South China Sea on the west and north, and the Celebes Sea on the south. This   position accounts for much of the variations in geographic, climatic and vegetational   conditions in the country.\\nThe topography of the bigger islands - particularly Luzon and Mindanao - is characterized by alluvial plains, narrow valleys, rolling hills and high mountains. The highest mountains are found in Mindanao and Luzon, with the altitudes varying from 1,790 to 3,144 meters. Most of the smaller islands are mountainous in the interior, surrounded by narrow strips of discontinuous flat lowlands which constitute the coastal rims. The shorelines of both large and small islands are irregular.\\nThe Philippines\\' fertile land accounts for the more than 900 species of orchids representing 100 genera that have been found. The sampaguita is the national flower.\\nAmong the country\\'s fauna are some endangered species like the Philippine   Eagle, the tarsier, and the mouse deer.\\nMetro Manila is strategically located in the middle of Luzon, on the eastern coast of Manila Bay and at the mouth of the Pasig River, sprawled over an area of 626 sq.km. Manila sits in the middle of a swampy deltaic plain formed by accumulated sedimentary deposits from the Pasig River and other streams.\\nThe city is between the bay to the west, the highlands to the east, and Laguna de Bay to the southeast. Most of its densely populated areas are found along the Pasig River running across the metropolis dividing it into two sections - the north and the south.\\nTIME ZONE:\\nGMT + 8 hours. Check out the Philippine Standard Time\\nCAPSULE HISTORY\\nBefore the Spanish conquistadores came, a thriving community flourished on the banks of the Pasig River. It was called \"Maynilad\", after the nilad plant whose star-shaped flowers clustered in abundance along the low-lying river banks.\\nThe lord of the riverside kingdom was Raha Sulayman who held court on the south side of the river while his uncle, Lakandula, ruled on the north side. The Spaniards were set on conquering this community. After the savage Battle of Bangkusay, where they overtook the natives with their awesome firepower, the Spaniards conquered Manila. In this Battle, Sulayman was killed.\\nRealizing its strategic position as a trading center and military outpost, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, head of the Spanish expedition, promptly declared Manila the capital of the new colonies won by Spain. On June 24, 1571, Manila was declared the capital of the entire achipelago. Delighted by this conquest, the King of Spain awarded the city a coat of arms and the grandiose title: \"The Noble and Ever Loyal City\". Soon, Manila became a replica of a European medieval city. There were churches, palaces and city halls built in the Spanish baroque style. Work began on building a wall around the city to keep the pirates and Moros at bay. It took 150 years to finish this wall. The end result was an astounding eight foot-thick, three mile-long wall, with two forts and a bastion, 370 guns in place, manned by a force of 5,000 men and 10,000 reserves. This walled city became known as Intramuros.\\nBeautiful as it was, Intramuros stood as a perfect illustration of the discrimination at that time against the natives called Indios. Although it was built by Indio workers and Chinese artisans, Intramuros was meant only for the clergy and the Spanish nobility. The natives could not enter except to work as servants. Outside the walls, in the arabales or suburbs, lived the Indios, the Chinese and other foreigners. The diversity of trade and culture in the suburbs made it alive and interesting. Tondo, Binondo, Sta. Cruz, and Quiapo bustled with commerce. These places were home to the merchants, carpenters, blacksmiths, carriage makers, masons, and other artisans.\\nOver the centuries, the Spanish rule was occasionally threatened by attacks from the sea and by internal uprisings. The Chinese, Dutch and British all tried to lay siege on Manila but were unsuccessful. But the 1880\\'s saw the birth of a reform movement led by Marcelo H. Del Pilar, Lopez Jaena and Jose Rizal (the national hero). This reform movement ultimately led to a revolution and by 1898, the days of the Castilian rule were numbered. The most lasting legacy of the Spanish rule was the Catholic religion which makes the Philippines the only Christian nation in Asia.\\nBut as soon as the Spaniards left, the Americans took over. 1902 was the beginning of the American era, a period characterized by the expansion of public education, advances in health care and the introduction of democratic government. The outbreak of war in the Pacific in 1941 disrupted American rule. Manila was declared an open city and the Americans withdrew their defenses. For three years, Manila was occupied by the Japanese imperial forces. Life at that time was made difficult by strict Japanese military rule. When the American troops entered Manila to liberate it, they had to bomb the city to dislodge the tenacious Japanese. Manila was devastated.\\nOn July 4, 1946, a year after the end of the war, the Philippine flag was hoisted signalling the recognition of Philippine independence.\\nTHE PEOPLE\\nThe Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million as of May 2000 (with a projected population of 88.7 million for 2007), and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture.\\nThe Filipino character is actually a little                                    bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan                                    or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos                                    are famous for, is said to be taken from Malay                                    forefathers. The close family relations are                                    said to have been inherited from the Chinese.                                    The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced                                    Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality                                    is a common denominator in the Filipino character                                    and this is what distinguishes the Filipino.                                    Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not                                    the only, English-proficient Oriental people                                    today. Filipino is the official national language,                                    with English considered as the country\\'s unofficial                                    one.\\nThe Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.\\nSome 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain\\'s lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian denominations and Buddhist.\\nThe country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the people of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.\\nHospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life, in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.\\nEthnic Groups: 91.5% Christian Malay, 4% Muslim Malay ,1.5% Chinese and 3% other.\\nCULTURE AND ARTS\\nThe major cultural agencies of government are the Cultural Center of the Philippines , the National Historical Institute , the National Museum, The National Library , the Records Management and Archives Office, and the Commission on the Filipino Language . The Heads of these cultural agencies are all ex-officio members of the NCCA Board and all except the Commission on the Filipino Language are together under the National Commission on Culture and Arts .\\nCLIMATE\\nThe Philippines has a tropical climate with relatively abundant rainfall and gentle winds. There are three pronounced seasons: the wet or rainy season from June to October, the cool, dry season from November to February, and the hot, dry season from March to May.\\nTemperature in Manila ranges from 21°C to 32°C with a 27°C average. The coolest month is January and the warmest is May. Both temperature and humidity levels reach the maximum in April and May, but these are generally good months for aquasports and mountain trekking. Some of the most colorful festivals are held during these months. More info\\nLANGUAGE\\nTwo official languages --- Filipino and English. Filipino, which is based on Tagalog, is the national language. English is also widely used and is the medium of instruction in higher education.\\nEight (8) major dialects spoken by majority of the Filipinos: Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon or Ilonggo, Bicolano, Waray, Pampango, and Pangasinense.\\nFilipino is that native language which is used nationally as the language of communication among ethnic groups . Like any living language, Filipino is in a process of development through loans from Philippine languages and non-native languages for various situations, among speakers of different social backgrounds, and for topics for conversation and scholarly discourse. There are about 76 to 78 major language groups, with more than 500 dialects.\\nRELIGION\\n', 0]\n",

Although it was built by Indio workers and Chinese artisans, Intramuros was meant only for the clergy and the Spanish nobility. The natives could not enter except to work as servants. Outside the walls, in the arabales or suburbs, lived the Indios, the Chinese and other foreigners. The diversity of trade and culture in the suburbs made it alive and interesting. Tondo, Binondo, Sta. Cruz, and Quiapo bustled with commerce. These places were home to the merchants, carpenters, blacksmiths, carriage makers, masons, and other artisans.\\nOver the centuries, the Spanish rule was occasionally threatened by attacks from the sea and by internal uprisings. The Chinese, Dutch and British all tried to lay siege on Manila but were unsuccessful. But the 1880\\'s saw the birth of a reform movement led by Marcelo H. Del Pilar, Lopez Jaena and Jose Rizal (the national hero). This reform movement ultimately led to a revolution and by 1898, the days of the Castilian rule were numbered. The most lasting legacy of the Spanish rule was the Catholic religion which makes the Philippines the only Christian nation in Asia.\\nBut as soon as the Spaniards left, the Americans took over. 1902 was the beginning of the American era, a period characterized by the expansion of public education, advances in health care and the introduction of democratic government. The outbreak of war in the Pacific in 1941 disrupted American rule. Manila was declared an open city and the Americans withdrew their defenses. For three years, Manila was occupied by the Japanese imperial forces. Life at that time was made difficult by strict Japanese military rule. When the American troops entered Manila to liberate it, they had to bomb the city to dislodge the tenacious Japanese. Manila was devastated.\\nOn July 4, 1946, a year after the end of the war, the Philippine flag was hoisted signalling the recognition of Philippine independence.\\nTHE PEOPLE\\nThe Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million as of May 2000 (with a projected population of 88.7 million for 2007), and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture.\\nThe Filipino character is actually a little                                    bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan                                    or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos                                    are famous for, is said to be taken from Malay                                    forefathers. The close family relations are                                    said to have been inherited from the Chinese.                                    The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced                                    Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality                                    is a common denominator in the Filipino character                                    and this is what distinguishes the Filipino.                                    Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not                                    the only, English-proficient Oriental people                                    today. Filipino is the official national language,                                    with English considered as the country\\'s unofficial                                    one.\\nThe Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.\\nSome 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain\\'s lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian denominations and Buddhist.\\nThe country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the people of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.\\nHospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life, in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.\\nEthnic Groups: 91.5% Christian Malay, 4% Muslim Malay ,1.5% Chinese and 3% other.\\nCULTURE AND ARTS\\nThe major cultural agencies of government are the Cultural Center of the Philippines , the National Historical Institute , the National Museum, The National Library , the Records Management and Archives Office, and the Commission on the Filipino Language . The Heads of these cultural agencies are all ex-officio members of the NCCA Board and all except the Commission on the Filipino Language are together under the National Commission on Culture and Arts .\\nCLIMATE\\nThe Philippines has a tropical climate with relatively abundant rainfall and gentle winds. There are three pronounced seasons: the wet or rainy season from June to October, the cool, dry season from November to February, and the hot, dry season from March to May.\\nTemperature in Manila ranges from 21°C to 32°C with a 27°C average. The coolest month is January and the warmest is May. Both temperature and humidity levels reach the maximum in April and May, but these are generally good months for aquasports and mountain trekking. Some of the most colorful festivals are held during these months. More info\\nLANGUAGE\\nTwo official languages --- Filipino and English. Filipino, which is based on Tagalog, is the national language. English is also widely used and is the medium of instruction in higher education.\\nEight (8) major dialects spoken by majority of the Filipinos: Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon or Ilonggo, Bicolano, Waray, Pampango, and Pangasinense.\\nFilipino is that native language which is used nationally as the language of communication among ethnic groups . Like any living language, Filipino is in a process of development through loans from Philippine languages and non-native languages for various situations, among speakers of different social backgrounds, and for topics for conversation and scholarly discourse. There are about 76 to 78 major language groups, with more than 500 dialects.\\nRELIGION\\n', 118]\n",

CONDE\\nContinue reading the main story\\nMANILA — Sometime in the late 1970s, Tony Tan Caktiong, the owner of a small ice cream parlor in a lower- middle-class neighborhood here, learned that an American hamburger chain was coming to invade the Philippines.\\nWorried that his store, which had just started selling burgers, might get floored by the new competition, Tan Caktiong, a Filipino of Chinese descent, took a leaf from the Chinese military tactician Sun Tzu: he flew to the United States to know his future enemy.\\nWhen he returned to the Philippines a few weeks later, Tan Caktiong brought with him an arsenal of ideas on how to fortify his store, called Jollibee, to face the newcomer.\\nWhat followed was a classic tale of survival that quickly became a Filipino legend that is now being retold in the country\\'s business schools, often with a tinge of nationalistic pride directed against the U.S. burger chain in question, McDonald\\'s.\\nTan Caktiong had no choice but to reinvent Jollibee.\\n\"He was told that either he sold Jollibee to McDonald\\'s or be its franchise holder here. \\'They will eat you alive,\\' his friends told him,\" said John Victor Tence, vice president for corporate and human resources of Jollibee Foods.\\nDescribed by friends as self-effacing and frugal but determined, Tan Caktiong told his friends, \"I have a third choice: I can fight McDonald\\'s.\"\\nAnd fight he did, using as weapons the very things that made McDonald\\'s successful: the mascot, the colorful uniforms of the crew, their cheerful greetings, French fries, fried chicken and a burger aimed at Filipino tastes and priced much lower.\\n\"He brought the standards of Jollibee notches higher, at least on par with McDonald\\'s, by basically copying what McDonald\\'s was doing,\" Tence said.\\nBy the time McDonald\\'s put up its first store here, in 1981, it no longer offered anything new. Jollibee, meanwhile, was already prepared, having opened nine branches and started an aggressive marketing campaign. Jollibee entered the list of the top 1,000 corporations in the Philippines that same year. By 1984, it was in the Top 500 list and dominated the local fast-food market.\\nThe Philippines, The Economist magazine wrote in 2002, \"is a huge embarrassment to McDonald\\'s,\" citing a Taylor Nelson Sofres study showing that Jollibee was the \"most often visited\" fast-food restaurant in the country.\\nJollibee had grown so big and confident that, in 1986, it opened its first store overseas, in Taiwan. It was a sign of things to come. In 1998, Jollibee would encroach on McDonald\\'s home territory, opening its first U.S. store in Daly City, California, which has a large Filipino population.\\nToday, Jollibee has more than 500 stores in the Philippines and 25 in other countries, selling more than half a million burgers every day. McDonald\\'s has about 250 outlets in the Philippines, according to Cerwin Eviota, a public relations consultant for the chain.\\nAside from the United States and Taiwan, Jollibee also has stores in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Saipan and Brunei, as well as in Vietnam, where sales grew 46 percent in the first quarter of 2004.\\nJollibee Foods also embarked on an ambitious expansion program domestically and overseas, and not just for its flagship stores.\\nIt bought Chowking, a popular Filipino fast-food chain that sells mainly Chinese food; it is now the dominant Chinese fast-food chain in the Philippines and has even entered the Indonesian market. Jollibee also acquired the local franchise for Delifrance, a French café and bakery chain.\\nIt also bought Greenwich, a small pizza chain that has grown larger in the Philippines than another American giant, Pizza Hut. And it acquired Yonghe King, a fast-food chain in China. All in all, Jollibee Foods has 1,186 stores in nine countries, including 120 in China.\\nJollibee is now the largest Filipino food company, with sales of 21.7 billion pesos, or $397 million, in 2004, up 13.7 percent from a year earlier. Sales in the first quarter of 2005 were up almost 20 percent.\\nYonghe King sales in China grew 27 percent in the first quarter. All its other stores are doing well, with Delifrance increasing its sales by almost 32 percent in the first quarter of 2005.\\nThe value of Jollibee stock has grown 28 percent since last year, and it was the best-performing domestic stock on the Philippine stock exchange.\\n1\\n', 14]\n",

Hay unos 3 millones de personas de habla hispana.\\nEl tagalo es la lengua hablada en Luzón central y regiones Tagalog del Sur así como la Región de Capital Nacional (NCR) o Metro Manila. En las provincias Luzón del Norte, el ilocano es la lengua hablada más común . Las provincias de Pangasinan y Pampanga también tienen su propia lengua. Adicional al sur del Metro Manila está la Región Bicol donde es usado el Bicolano. En las Islas del Sur de Bisayas y Mindanao, el cebuano es la lengua más común.

Otros grupos incluyen a los coreanos, japonés, del Medio Oriente, y los europeos/norteamericanos que comprenden los otros grupos principales.\\nLa comunicación no sería demasiado fastidio para el viajero de habla inglesa, ya que mucha gente tiene conocimientos del idioma. Filipinas también tiene uno de los porcentajes más altos de hablantes realmente bilingües y multilingües en el mundo, superando otras naciones oficialmente bilingües/multilingües y territorios en Asia, como Malasia, Singapur, y Hong Kong. El inglés es extensamente usado por todo el país pero a niveles diferentes, en particular en las grandes ciudades . También es extensamente usado en el gobierno, los medios, y en el comercio. Los signos de la calle y las vallas publicitarias estarán probablemente en inglés, pero los mensajes de servicio público pueden estar en el filipino.

Solo estuve en \"Metro Manila\" que comprende 15 ciudades con 16 millones de habitantes, de una población total de 90 millones. No pude visitar las bellezas naturales en el norte y en el sur.\\nEn 1564 comenzó la colonización española que duró más de 300 años. Para que los frailes pudiesen identificar a los nativos, les dieron a escoger de una lista de nombres castellanos, que aún hoy perduran en los filipinos y en las calles; pero el castellano no logró sustituir a los dialectos indígenas. Manila floreció con los galeones que intercambiaban especies y mercancías chinas por el oro y plata mexicanos desde el puerto de Acapulco, pero el lucrativo intercambio desapareció a fines del siglo XVIII.\\nHoy casi nadie habla castellano y la influencia norteamericana es evidente\\nLa derrota española en la guerra hispano-cubana-americana provocó la pérdida de Cuba y las Filipinas en 1898. Durante la colonia de EE UU se implantó el inglés como lengua oficial enseñada en las escuelas. La ocupación norteamericana fue interrumpida por la invasión japonesa durante la II Guerra Mundial; en 1945, Manila fue destruida por el bombardeo de MacArthur frente a la fuerte resistencia nipona, causando 150.000 muertes de civiles. Los filipinos alcanzaron la soñada independencia en 1946.\\nHoy, casi nadie habla castellano, aunque la élite educada lo domina. La lengua principal es el tagalo (uno de los 165 dialectos existentes) con palabras españolas mezcladas que muchos filipinos creen que son parte del idioma vernáculo. El inglés es el segundo idioma, pero no todos lo hablan.\\nCasi todo lo relacionado con el comer es en castellano: mesa, silla, cubiertos, cuchillo, cuchara, tenedor, servilleta, merienda, vaso y botella. \"Platos\" típicos son el lechón, el adobo (de cerdo y pollo), la caldereta (de cabra) y el arroz caldo; se conservan tapas, puchero, leche, repollo, calabaza, harina (sin h) y jamón (con h), pan y mantequilla, carne, calamares, patatas, chocolate, limonada, azúcar (asúkal) y manzana, pera, uvas, papaya, melón y pomelo. Partes del hogar y los muebles continúan siendo llamados puerta, ventana, cama, sofá, aparador y escaparate. Los meses y los días de la semana son en castellano. Lo mismo ocurre en la ropa: pantalón, blusa, zapatos, camiseta, calzoncillo, sombrero, corbata y algunas palabras antiguas como chinelas y saya. También las familiares (padre y madre, abuelo y abuela, compadre y comadre), partes del cuerpo (cabeza, mano, brazo, lengua), oficios (carpintero, barbero, dentista, mecánico, basurero, juez, sastre, capitán), religión (iglesia, católico, Dios, Virgen María), negocios y servicios (botica, banco, hacienda, cementerio), animales (toro, caballo, pato) y flores (rosas, jazmín).\\nSe pide \"permiso\", una característica nacional es el \"amor propio\", los hombres tienen \"queridas\" pero no se usa \"queridos\", y hay \"guapos\" pero no \"guapas\" (a pesar de la aparente inequidad de género ha habido dos \"presidentas\"). Si uno está \"aburrido\" se va a una \"fiesta\", toma un \"café\" o una \"cerveza\" San Miguel y se despide con un \"adiós\".\\nEn la ciudad colonial (\"Intramuros\") perduran las murallas casi intactas, el Fuerte de Santiago que domina el río, la iglesia de San Agustín (la más antigua del país), el manuscrito del héroe nacional José Rizal El último adiós y una mansión reconstruida (Casa Manila) con bellísimos muebles antiguos de rejilla y estupenda cerámica española. El Museo Ayala tiene la mejor colección de oro que he visto, y el Museo del Pueblo Filipino exhibe los restos del galeón San Diego hundido en 1600 con un centenar de piezas de vajilla española.\\nFilipinas es una sociedad multiétnica, gran parte de la población es de descendencia china, y muchos son ricos. Los dos hoteles más lujosos son el Sangri-la y el Mandarín. Chinatown se extiende dos kilómetros, flanqueada por dos puertas chinas, y atiborrada de establecimientos de todo tipo. El enorme cementerio chino está lleno de \"apartamentos\", muchos de dos pisos, con aire acondicionado, cocina y baño. Para el día de difuntos los familiares van en la víspera, duermen en el piso superior, y al día siguiente preparan sus comidas y juegan al dominó o al majong frente a las tumbas de sus antepasados.\\nLa influencia norteamericana es evidente, la comida rápida (McDonald\\'s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin Donuts) ya está creando obesidad. El pasatiempo en Manila es el malling, pues el calor es abrumador y los malls tienen aire refrigerado. En Makati (el centro de negocios y de los grandes hoteles), el Greenbelt Mall se compone de cinco edificios inmensos, conectados por jardines tropicales, tiendas de marcas famosas y docenas de restaurantes.\\nEl tráfico en Manila es horroroso (peor que en Ciudad México). Una distancia corta que el domingo se recorre en taxi en 20 minutos, toma una hora y media durante días de trabajo. El vehículo más popular es el jeepney, un híbrido con frente de jeep y alargado atrás para dar cabida a 16 pasajeros. Hay un tren elevado, siempre abarrotado, y los buses grandes son escasos.\\nLos filipinos son muy amables y corteses. Un gesto común de bienvenida es llevarse la mano derecha al corazón o una pequeña reverencia.

It\\'s spreading in the developing world because mobile phones are much more common than bank accounts.\\nThe system is particularly useful for the 8 million Filipinos — 10% of the country\\'s citizens — who work overseas and send money home, like Dennis\\' mother, Anna Tiangco. Previously, she sent money via a bank wire transfer, which costs $2.50 and takes two days to clear. The cellphone method costs only 13 cents, and is nearly instantaneous.\\n\"The good thing here is, wherever my children are, they can text me and I can send money immediately,\" she said by telephone from Hong Kong.\\nConsumers also can store limited amounts of money on their cellphones to buy things at stores that participate in the network — although this practice isn\\'t yet widespread in the Philippines.\\nMany more Filipinos use their phones to send airtime values called \"loads\" to prepaid subscribers. A parent, for example, can send a 60-peso load to replenish a child\\'s cellphone, charged to the parent\\'s account.\\nWhile Japanese and South Korean consumers have been using cellphones as virtual wallets for several years, those systems use a computer chip implanted in handset that allows people to buy things by waving the phone in front of a sensor. The Philippine system relies on simple text messages, which cost just 2 cents to send.\\nThe 41 million cellphone users in the Philippines are avid texters. The electronic connections have fostered a culture of quick greetings and forwarded jokes. Text messages also played a key role in mobilizing crowds that fueled the 2001 \"people power\" revolt that ousted President Joseph Estrada.\\nThe Philippines\\' two biggest mobile service providers, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications, have harnessed this penchant for text messaging to enable consumers to enter the world of e-commerce.\\nTapping into the cash flow from overseas Filipinos — who sent home $12.7 billion last year — Globe and Smart forged partnerships with foreign mobile providers and banks, as well as with local banks and merchants, to create a network that allows users to send and receive cash internationally.\\nWhen Anna Tiangco wants to send cash home, for example, she goes to a branch of her local provider, Hong Kong CSL Ltd., where a clerk credits her cellphone with the amount she has brought with her. She then transfers the money to family members via text messages — in essence instructing her providers to deduct money from her balance to the recipients she indicates.\\nIf a cellphone loaded with cash values is lost or stolen, the money can\\'t be tapped as long as the personal identification number isn\\'t revealed. Control over the funds can be restored with a replacement SIM card from either mobile provider.\\nThe system was \"built for remote payments and for the unbanked markets,\" said Rizza Maniego Eala, president of G-Xchange, Globe\\'s subsidiary in charge of its G-Cash money transfer service.\\nEala said her company\\'s 500,000 G-Cash users transfer about $100 million monthly, but she declined to say how many transactions involve remittances from overseas.\\nSmart offers a slightly different money transfer system, used by about 5 million Filipinos, that links cash or a debit card to a cellphone.\\nUsers load up their phones with money via text messages. The card, which does not require a bank account, can then be used to purchase goods in establishments that accept MasterCard, or to withdraw cash from an ATM machine.\\nSmart Communications spokesman Ramon Isberto said each time the recipient spends the money, the sender receives a transaction message. That allows the sender to see how the funds are used.\\n\"The added value there now is that Filipinos overseas have greater control over their funds. Believe me, that is important to them,\" he said.\\nSmart and UAE\\'s leading telecommunications operator, Etisalat, have agreed to provide money transfer service to hundreds of thousands of Filipinos in the Middle East. Smart also will soon launch a remittance system in Bahrain in partnership with MTC-Vodafone and Ahli United Bank there, and Banco de Oro in the Philippines, Isberto said.\\n\"The bank products remain clearly bank products. We positioned ourselves as an enabler for banks and other financial institutions to provide products and services to their customers in ways they would otherwise not have been able to,\" he said.\\nAside from transferring cash and making purchases, both Globe and Smart also allow their users to pay bills with their phones. Anna Tiangco said she pays her family\\'s electric bills in San Miguel from Hong Kong via text messages, just like she sends money.\\n\"Even if we are far apart, it\\'s like we are still together,\" she said. \"This is like my wallet now.\"\\nCopyright 2007 The Associated Press.

Esto se refleja en la ausencia                  de instituciones geriátricas, dedicadas al cuidado de personas mayores.\\nCultura\\nLas artes como la música formaban parte de la vida pre-hispánica            en Filipinas. Los instrumentos musicales como la flauta y la guitarra de            bambú y el gong, eran utilizados en épocas que datan del año 500. Existían            también canciones indígenas para las distintas fases de la vida - el nacimiento,            la infancia, el noviazgo, el matrimonio y la muerte. La pintura, en especial sobre el cuerpo           humano, se practicaba también. Las primeras personas encontradas por Magallanes y su            tripulación eran indígenas con tatuajes que llamaron \"pintados\".\\nLos primeros exploradores y cronistas españoles se sorprendieron cuando se enteraron que           la escritura ya estaba desarrollada en muchas partes del archipiélago y que muchos indígenas            eran alfabetos. Las primeras escrituras estaban probablemente hechas en materiales perecederos            tales como las hojas y las cortezas de los árboles así que los investigadores y los antropólogos            no pudieron determinar con exactitud cuando fueron realizadas las primeras escrituras en el país.           Creen que podría haber sido desarrollada entre 200 años AC y 1.200 DC, inicialmente para anotar            transacciones comerciales y posteriormente para apuntar canciones, cuentos populares,            poesía y otras formas de la literatura.\\nDiversidad de culturas en el país\\nLa existencia de un variado número de diferentes idiomas, dialectos y de tradiciones religiosas ha hecho que los filipinos no hayan desarrollado una única cultura nacional. Durante muchos siglos, la evolución de la historia cultural de Filipinas ha tenido una naturaleza local, enriquecida con influencias de China, Malaysia, España y Estados Unidos. Los elementos populares indígenas encontraron expresión en la literatura y en la música, así como en otras formas culturales. Entre los deportes tradicionales se encuentran el arnis, un tipo de esgrima con palos de madera, y el sipa, un juego muy parecido al voleibol, excepto en que los jugadores usan tanto los pies como sus manos y brazos. Las peleas de gallos y el boxeo son muy populares y la influencia cultural estadounidense se aprecia en la popularidad del béisbol y del baloncesto.\\nUna de las características más notables de la sociedad filipina es la tradición de una fuerte fidelidad familiar. Esto se refleja en la ausencia de instituciones geriátricas, dedicadas a acoger a las personas mayores, y de orfanatos. Desde la época precolonial, las mujeres filipinas tenían elevadas posiciones en la sociedad y, en la actualidad, continúan desempeñando importantes cargos en la vida económica, social y política.\\nAdemás de las bibliotecas universitarias, las principales bibliotecas del país son la Biblioteca de la Ciudad de Manila, la Biblioteca Nacional y la biblioteca del Instituto de la Ciencia y de Información Tecnológica, todas en Manila. El Museo y la Biblioteca Memorial López, en Pasay, tienen colecciones de pinturas de los principales artistas filipinos, así como las cartas y manuscritos del escritor y patriota José Rizal.\\nEl Museo de Santo Tomás, en Manila, tiene las colecciones arqueológicas y de historia natural más destacadas, que ilustran la historia de las islas. El Museo Nacional, en Manila, tiene divisiones de antropología, botánica, geología y zoología, junto a colecciones de arte y un planetario.\\nLa literatura filipina anterior a la llegada de los españoles consistía en historias populares de transmisión oral y proverbios que circulaban en los diversos dialectos de las islas. La literatura bajo la influencia española fue en un principio poética y religiosa y se desarrolló posteriormente bajo la influencia estadounidense hacia la narrativa y el teatro. Entre los escritores de Filipinas se encuentran el novelista José Rizal, Francisco Balagtas, poeta y filósofo, José García Villa, poeta y uno de los escritores más destacados en narrativa corta, Carlos P. Rómulo, periodista y diplomático, el poeta y dramaturgo Claro Recto, el poeta, novelista y dramaturgo Nick Joaquín, y Pas Marques Benitz, un escritor de narrativa corta.\\nEl kundiman, una combinación de palabras y música, es único en las islas. Entre los músicos de fama de Filipinas destacan Rodolfo Cornejo, compositor y director musical, Antonino Buenaventura, director musical, y Antonio J. Molina, director musical y compositor. Los bailes populares son también destacados y hay muchos bailes ceremoniales y tradicionales para diferentes ocasiones.\\nLas artes y la música\\nLos filipinos estuvieron expuestos a las artes y la música europea con la introducción del violín,            el piano, el arpa, la guitarra y otros instrumentos. El órgano de bambú en Las Piñas,            construido en 1.818, forma parte del legado de la música filipina durante la época colonial.           Los bailes populares mexicanos como la polca, la jota y el rigodón influyeron en la danza           nativa filipina.\\nCalendario gregoriano\\nFueron los españoles que sincronizaron el calendario filipino con el resto del mundo a través de            la introducción del calendario gregoriano en 1844.\\n', 16]\n",

During 2016, the current account balance narrowed to its lowest level since the 2008 global financial crisis, but nevertheless mustered a surplus for a 14th consecutive year. International reserves remain at comfortable levels and the banking system is stable.\\nEfforts to improve tax administration and expenditures management have helped ease the Philippines\\' debt burden and tight fiscal situation. The Philippines received investment-grade credit ratings on its sovereign debt under the former AQUINO administration and has had little difficulty financing its budget deficits. However, weak absorptive capacity and implementation bottlenecks have prevented the government from maximizing its expenditure plans. Although it has improved, the low tax-to-GDP ratio remains a constraint to supporting increasingly higher spending levels and sustaining high and inclusive growth over the longer term.\\nEconomic growth has accelerated, averaging 6.1% per year from 2011 to 2016, compared with 4.5% under the MACAPAGAL-ARROYO government; and competitiveness rankings have improved. Although 2016 saw a record year for net foreign direct investment inflows, FDI to the Philippines has continued to lag regional peers, in part because the Philippine constitution and other laws restrict foreign ownership in important activities/sectors - such as land ownership and public utilities.\\nAlthough the economy grew at a faster pace under the AQUINO government, challenges to achieving more inclusive growth remain. Wealth is concentrated in the hands of the rich. The unemployment rate declined from 7.3% to 5.5% between 2010 and 2016 but the jobs are low paying and tedious. Underemployment hovers at around 18% to 19% of the employed. At least 40% of the employed work in the informal sector. Poverty afflicts more than a fifth of the population. More than 60% of the poor reside in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty (about 30%) is more severe - a challenge to raising rural farm and non-farm incomes. Continued efforts are needed to improve governance, the judicial system, the regulatory environment, the infrastructure, and the overall ease of doing business.\\n2016 saw the election of President Rodrigo DUTERTE, who has pledged to make inclusive growth and poverty reduction his top priority. DUTERTE believes that illegal drug use, crime and corruption are key barriers to economic development among the lower income class. This administration wants to reduce the poverty rate to 14% and graduate the economy to upper-middle income status by the end of President DUTERTE’s term in 2022. Key themes under the government’s Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda include continuity of macroeconomic policy, tax reform, higher investments in infrastructure and human capital development, and improving competitiveness and the overall ease of doing business. The administration has vowed to address spending bottlenecks and is pushing for congressional passage of a Comprehensive Tax Reform Program to help finance more aggressive infrastructure and social spending, starting in 2018. The government also supports relaxing restrictions on foreign ownership, except for land.\\n', 183]\n",

Landa Jocano sugiere que los antepasados de los filipinos actuales surgieron y se desarrollaron localmente. Por su parte, la teoría del origen isleño de Wilhelm Solheim postula que el poblamiento del archipiélago se dio a través de las rutas de comercio que provenían de la zona de Sonda alrededor de los años 48\\xa0000 a 5000 a.\\xa0C., en vez de una migración a gran escala. [35] \\u200b La teoría de la expansión austronesia afirma que varios grupos malayo-polinesios procedentes de la isla de Taiwán comenzaron a migrar a Filipinas alrededor del 4000 a.\\xa0C., desplazando a los primeros pobladores.

[38] \\u200b\\nEn el transcurso de los siguientes siglos, el comercio con los pueblos marítimos y otros países asiáticos trajo consigo la influencia del islam , el budismo y el hinduismo . Durante este tiempo no hubo ningún Estado político unificador que abarcara todo el archipiélago filipino. En su lugar, las islas estaban divididas entre varias talasocracias que a menudo luchaban entre sí, gobernadas por varios datus , rajás o sultanes .

[20] \\u200b La colonización comenzó en 1565, cuando el explorador español Miguel López de Legazpi llegó desde la Nueva España y fundó el primer asentamiento español en la actual Cebú . En 1571, después de tratar con las familias reales nativas durante la conspiración de Tondo y tras derrotar a la tripulación del pirata chino Limahong , los españoles establecieron en Manila la capital de Filipinas y de las Indias Orientales Españolas . [45] \\u200b [21] \\u200b\\nEl dominio español significó la unidad política del archipiélago por primera vez en su historia. Desde 1565 hasta 1821 la Capitanía General de las Filipinas dependió del Virreinato de la Nueva España con sede en la ciudad de México y después de la Guerra de Independencia de México , se administró directamente desde Madrid. Desde esta misma Capitanía, España controlaba otros de sus territorios en el Pacífico , entre ellos Guam , Palaos , las Islas Carolinas y las Islas Marianas . [46] \\u200b Entre los siglos XVI y XIX, el galeón de Manila comunicó la capital de Filipinas con Acapulco , realizando un viaje o dos al año en ambas direcciones. El comercio transpacífico introdujo en el archipiélago alimentos como el maíz , el tomate , la patata , el chile y la piña , todos procedentes de América . [21] \\u200b Los misioneros católicos convirtieron a la mayoría de los habitantes al cristianismo y fundaron escuelas, universidades y hospitales.

En una extensión de los combates de la Guerra de los Siete Años , fuerzas británicas ocuparon brevemente la ciudad de Manila.

Durante dos meses mantuvo bloqueada la bahía de Manila, cerrando además el estrecho de San Bernandino [50] \\u200b. En este período muchos españoles nacidos en Filipinas ( criollos ) y los de ascendencia mixta ( mestizos ) se hicieron ricos. La afluencia de colonos españoles y latinoamericanos disminuyó el poder de la Iglesia y abrió algunos puestos en el gobierno tradicionalmente ocupados por los españoles nacidos en la península Ibérica ( peninsulares ). Los ideales de la revolución también comenzaron a extenderse a través de las islas.

El 12 de junio de 1898, Aguinaldo declaró la independencia filipina de España en Kawit , Cavite, y al año siguiente se estableció la Primera República Filipina . Por su parte, cuando España perdió la guerra firmó el Tratado de París en 1898 , en el cual cedió el dominio de las islas a Estados Unidos por US$ 20 millones. [22] \\u200b Como se hacía cada vez más evidente que los Estados Unidos no reconocerían a la Primera República Filipina, estalló la Guerra filipino-estadounidense . Al perder el conflicto, el archipiélago terminó bajo el control total estadounidense, ya que hasta entonces había sido administrado como un área insular ; en 1935, Filipinas obtuvo el estatus de « Estado libre asociado » [23] \\u200b bajo el nombre de Mancomunidad Filipina .\\nEn la década siguiente, los planes por recuperar la independencia fueron interrumpidos por la Segunda Guerra Mundial , en particular cuando el Imperio japonés invadió el país y estableció un gobierno títere , la Segunda República Filipina . Durante el conflicto se cometieron múltiples crímenes de guerra , como la Marcha de la Muerte de Batán y la Masacre de Manila , que culminó con la batalla de Manila . [56] \\u200b Los crímenes contra la población de origen español y los asaltos a las sedes oficiales españolas en Filipinas provocaron gran inquietud en el gobierno de Francisco Franco . Como consecuencia, España rompió las relaciones diplomáticas con Japón el 12 de abril de 1945.

Mientras tanto, el Hukbalahap , un ejército rebelde comunista que anteriormente luchaba contra los japoneses, continuaba activo en las regiones rurales. Finalmente, esta amenaza fue abordada por el Secretario de la Defensa Nacional y posterior presidente Ramón Magsaysay , aunque se siguieron presentando algunos casos esporádicos de insurgencia comunista.

Como la Constitución prohibía ser reelegido más de dos veces para el cargo presidencial, al final de su segundo mandato declaró la ley marcial el 21 de septiembre de 1972. Para seguir gobernando por decreto, utilizó como argumentos la división política, la tensión de la Guerra Fría y el espectro de la rebelión comunista y de la insurgencia islámica en el país. [60] \\u200b De esta manera inició una dictadura que duró más de diez años y que se caracterizó por el estricto control de la economía y por la represión política. [61] \\u200b [62] \\u200b\\nEl 21 de agosto de 1983, Benigno «Ninoy» Aquino, Jr. , líder de la oposición al gobierno de Marcos, ignoró las advertencias y regresó del exilio en Estados Unidos. Fue asesinado al aterrizar su avión en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Manila —ahora llamado Aeropuerto Internacional Ninoy Aquino, en su memoria—. Al aumentar la presión política, Marcos convocó a elecciones presidenciales en 1986. [25] \\u200b Corazón Aquino , viuda de Benigno, se convirtió en la líder de la oposición y en candidata para la contienda presidencial. Cuando Marcos se proclamó ganador, muchos pensaron que las elecciones habían estado arregladas. Esto condujo a la Revolución EDSA , instigada cuando dos de los aliados más antiguos de Marcos — Fidel V. Ramos , Jefe del Estado Mayor adjunto de las Fuerzas Armadas, y Juan Ponce Enrile , Secretario de la Defensa Nacional— renunciaron y se manifestaron en el campo Aguinaldo y el campo Crame. El Cardenal Arzobispo de Manila, Jaime Sin , exhortó a las personas a reunirse en apoyo a los líderes rebeldes y a protestar en la Avenida Epifanio de los Santos (EDSA). Ante las protestas masivas y las deserciones militares, Marcos y sus aliados huyeron a Hawái , donde fueron exiliados. Ese mismo año, Corazón Aquino fue nombrada presidenta. [59] \\u200b [63] \\u200b\\nEl retorno de la democracia y las reformas al gobierno después de los sucesos de 1986 se vieron obstaculizados por la deuda nacional, la corrupción , los intentos de golpe de Estado , una persistente insurgencia comunista y los movimientos separatistas islámicos. Aunque la economía mejoró durante la administración de Fidel V. Ramos, quien fue elegido presidente en 1992, [24] \\u200b el inicio de la crisis financiera asiática de 1997 frenó estos avances. En 2001, en medio de acusaciones de corrupción y un proceso de destitución estancado, el sucesor de Ramos, Joseph Estrada , fue expulsado de la presidencia por la Revolución de EDSA de 2001 y reemplazado por Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo . Finalmente, como resultado de las elecciones de mayo de 2010 , Benigno «Noynoy» Aquino III fue elegido presidente. [64] \\u200b En noviembre de 2013 el tifón Haiyan devastó la parte central del archipiélago, afectó a más de once millones de filipinos y provocó la muerte de más de cinco mil personas; [65] \\u200b [66] \\u200b la prensa criticó la lenta respuesta por parte del gobierno de Aquino III. [67] \\u200b\\nGobierno y política[ editar ]\\nEl presidente Rodrigo Duterte .\\nFilipinas es una república constitucional con un sistema presidencial de gobierno, administrado como un Estado unitario , con la excepción de la Región Autónoma del Mindanao Musulmán , que es en gran parte independiente del gobierno nacional. El presidente actúa como Jefe de Estado y Jefe de gobierno , además de ser el Comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas . Es elegido por voto popular para un periodo único de seis años, durante el cual él mismo elige y preside su propio gabinete . [7] \\u200b El vicepresidente también es elegido por sufragio directo para un periodo de seis años, y puede reelegirse una vez. El vicepresidente puede ocupar un puesto en el gabinete, y en caso de que el presidente muera o renuncie, se convertiría en el presidente interino y convocaría elecciones. A nivel local, el poder ejecutivo está representado por los gobernadores de las provincias, los alcaldes de las ciudades y municipios y por los capitanes de los barangay . [68] \\u200b\\nEl Congreso bicameral está compuesto por el Senado —equivalente a la cámara alta , con miembros elegidos para un periodo de seis años— y la Cámara de Representantes —la cámara baja , con miembros elegidos para un periodo de tres años—. Los senadores son elegidos al mismo tiempo que el presidente, mientras que los representantes se eligen mediante distritos legislativos y por medio de representación proporcional . [7] \\u200b El Congreso se encarga de la creación y aprobación de leyes y reformas a la constitución por medio de resoluciones y proyectos de ley . Para que cualquier proyecto de ley sea aprobado debe recibir más de dos tercios de los votos a favor en ambas cámaras. [69] \\u200b\\nEl poder judicial está encabezado por la Corte Suprema , compuesta por el Jefe de Justicia como el juez presidente y catorce jueces asociados, los cuales son elegidos por el presidente de entre varios candidatos propuestos por el Consejo de Justicia y Colegio de Abogados. [7] \\u200b El poder judicial goza de una autonomía fiscal, aunque se encuentra supervisado por la Oficina del Administrador de las Cortes. La Corte Suprema también promulga el reglamento de todas las cortes y participa en el proceso de enseñanza de los futuros abogados . [70] \\u200b Desde la administración del gobierno de Ramos, hubo varios intentos por reformar el gobierno a un sistema federal , unicameral o parlamentario . [71] \\u200b [72] \\u200b\\nEl presidente Noynoy Aquino ante el Congreso de Filipinas.\\nEl sistema legal establecido por la Constitución de 1987 contiene elementos heredados de la época del dominio español y estadounidense. Por ejemplo, aquellas cuestiones sobre propiedad, familia y la ausencia de un jurado en los juicios son característicos del derecho continental , existente en España. Sin embargo, el derecho anglosajón instalado por los Estados Unidos a principios del siglo XX es el que rige en algunas de las cuestiones legales más importantes. Entre estas, destacan el comercio, las relaciones laborales, los impuestos, la banca y la moneda. [73] \\u200b\\nEl sistema multipartidista filipino permite la existencia de numerosos partidos políticos, aunque en la práctica es común que se creen alianzas para obtener más votos durante las contiendas electorales. Por su parte, la Comisión de Elecciones (Comelec) definió seis partidos como los más importantes en el país: el Partido Liberal , el Lakas Kampi CMD , el Partido Nacionalista , la Coalición Popular Nacionalista , el Partido de la Unión Nacional y la Alianza Unida Nacionalista . [74] \\u200b Desde 1992, las elecciones nacionales y locales se celebran cada tres años el segundo lunes de mayo. Solo las elecciones para presidente y vicepresidente se realizan cada seis años. [75] \\u200b La edad mínima para votar es de 18 años. En las últimas elecciones presidenciales, celebradas en 2010, participaron poco más de 38 millones de votantes, un 74,34\\xa0% de los registrados en el padrón electoral. [76] \\u200b Benigno Aquino III y Jejomar Binay fueron electos para el puesto de presidente y vicepresidente en 2010, respectivamente, pero tras las elecciones del 9 de mayo de 2016, Rodrigo Duterte ganó la presidencia. [77] \\u200b [78] \\u200b\\nAunque en Filipinas la homosexualidad no es ilegal, existe cierta discriminación por parte de la sociedad en general hacia este grupo. Hasta 2009 los homosexuales tenían prohibido alistarse a las fuerzas armadas. [79] \\u200b Aunque se han realizado múltiples esfuerzos en la lucha por los derechos de la comunidad LGBT , el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo aún es ilegal y no existe reconocimiento para las uniones legales efectuadas en otros países.

[82] \\u200b [83] \\u200b [84] \\u200b [85] \\u200b\\nAdemás de su participación en la ONU, el país es uno de los fundadores y miembro activo de la Asociación de Naciones del Sudeste Asiático (ASEAN), una organización diseñada para fortalecer las relaciones y promover el crecimiento económico y cultural entre los estados de la región del sudeste de Asia . [86] \\u200b Ha sido sede en varias de sus cumbres y es un contribuyente activo en la dirección y las políticas del bloque. [87] \\u200b Las relaciones que actualmente disfruta con otros estados del sudeste de Asia contrastan con la situación de la década de 1970, cuando estaba en guerra con Vietnam y se disputaba el territorio de Sabah con Malasia , si bien aún existen desacuerdos respecto a las Islas Spratly . [88] \\u200b\\nCuerpo de Marines de los Estados Unidos en un ejercicio militar en territorio filipino.\\nPor otra parte, posee buenas relaciones con los Estados Unidos, a quien apoyó durante la Guerra Fría y la Guerra contra el terrorismo . [81] \\u200b No obstante, en años recientes la presencia estadounidense en las bases militares de Bahía Subic y Clark y el Acuerdo de Fuerzas Visitantes han generado cierta controversia. [81] \\u200b También Japón , el mayor contribuyente oficial de ayuda para el desarrollo del país, es considerado como uno de sus principales aliados. [91] \\u200b Aunque aún prevalecen ciertos debates históricos entre los dos países —sobre todo en temas como las mujeres de confort —, gran parte de la enemistad surgida por los acontecimientos de la Segunda Guerra Mundial han desaparecido. [92] \\u200b\\nFilipinas también ha entablado buenas relaciones con otras naciones. El hecho de compartir varios valores democráticos facilita sus relaciones con los países europeos y occidentales. Los problemas económicos por los que atraviesa le ayudan a crear vínculos con otros países en desarrollo que cursan con obstáculos similares. Del mismo modo, los lazos históricos y las similitudes culturales estrechan las relaciones con España y América Latina . [93] \\u200b A pesar de los problemas que afectan a los trabajadores filipinos en el extranjero, como el abuso doméstico y la guerra, así como los obstáculos planteados por una insurgencia islámica en Mindanao, las relaciones con los países del Medio Oriente —incluidos Egipto , Irán , Irak , Libia , Arabia Saudita y los Emiratos Árabes Unidos — son buenas, lo que permite que los más de dos millones de filipinos puedan seguir viviendo y trabajando en la región. [94] \\u200b Por su parte, las relaciones con la República Popular China han mejorado considerablemente, en especial desde la década de 1950. Sin embargo, varias cuestiones relacionadas con el reconocimiento de la República de China , la posesión de las Islas Spratly y la preocupación del crecimiento de la influencia china, impiden una relación estrecha entre ambos vecinos. [92] \\u200b Recientemente, la política exterior filipina se ha ido encaminando principalmente a entablar mejores relaciones económicas con sus vecinos del sudeste asiático y del Pacífico.

Otros grupos militantes como el Frente de Liberación Islámica Moro , los comunistas del Nuevo Ejército del Pueblo y Abu Sayyaf aún luchan en otras provincias, pero su presencia se ha reducido en años recientes, gracias a los operativos de seguridad implantados por el gobierno. [96] \\u200b [97] \\u200b\\nTambién cabe destacar que Filipinas ha sido un aliado de los Estados Unidos desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial : en 1951, ambos países firmaron un tratado de defensa mutua. Filipinas apoyó la ideología estadounidense durante la Guerra Fría , así como su participación en las guerras de Corea y Vietnam . Incluso, fue miembro de la disuelta SEATO , una organización cuyo objetivo era efectuar un papel similar a la OTAN en la región, entre cuyos miembros se encontraban Australia , Francia , Nueva Zelanda , Pakistán , Tailandia , Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. [98] \\u200b Después del inicio de la Guerra contra el terrorismo , el ejército filipino fue parte de la coalición que brindó apoyo a los EE.

After the                                1986 \"people power\" revolution that toppled                                dictator Ferdinand Marcos, nationalistic framers                                of the new 1987 constitution mandated the use of                                Filipino or Tagalog as the main medium of                                instruction in schools in a drive to promote a                                sense of \"Filipino identity\".\\nHowever,                                English has remained the language of business and                                trade for the Philippines\\' export-geared economy.                                Nowadays, Filipinos\\' widespread use of \"Taglish\"                                often perplexes their international business                                partners, including Norwegian shipping company                                managers, who say that they often cross linguistic                                wires when speaking with their Filipino ship                                crews. (Filipinos currently account for about 25%                                of the global supply of seafarers.)\\nBrain drain\\nHas the                                Philippines reached the limit of its absorptive capacity                                for outsourcing? In 2000, there were only four                                call centers in the country, employing 2,400                                call-center agents. At the end of 2005, there were at                                least 105 call centers with over 112,000 workers,                                representing a 60% per annum growth surge.\\nAccording to Dan Sebastian                                Reyes, chief executive officer of Clientlogic, a                                call-center firm, that\\'s a growth record that not even                                India, which currently employs 350,000 call-center agents                                but is now facing similar human resource                                restraints, has been able to replicate.\\nSignificantly, the frenetic growth of the                                Philippines\\' outsourcing industry coincided with                                an unfortunate concomitant trend: the brain-drain                                of skilled professionals to higher paying                                countries. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the bulk                                of Filipino labor exports were composed of                                low-skilled workers, mostly construction workers,                                domestic helpers, and entertainers.\\nBy                                2000, however, officials from the Philippine                                Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), a                                government agency managing the placement of                                overseas Filipino workers, recorded a rising tide                                of fleeing skilled workers and professionals,                                including doctors, nurses, engineers, information                                technology professionals and banking                                professionals, among others. In other words,                                precisely the types of workers outsourcing                                companies would most like to hire.\\nThe                                growing scarcity of English speakers has alarmed                                the Philippines-based outsourcing community, which                                executives say they began to notice shortages as                                early as 2003. Many of these companies have since                                established training programs at private                                universities and human resource consulting companies that train potential recruits.\\nFor instance, outsourcer FuturePerfect is                                helping Mapua Institute of Technology, one of the                                leading engineering and technology schools in                                Manila, to develop their English language                                curriculum and retrain their English instructors.

According to Dominguez, John                                Clements\\' CEO, this has led to a 60% absorption                                rate of students trained in the program.\\nSensing the potential loss in one of                                the few bright spots in the Philippines\\' economy,                                the national government has also started to                                throw money at the problem. President                                Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo recently earmarked P500                                million ($9.8 million) for outsourcing industry                                training. As a part of that scheme, students                                interested in outsourcing jobs are given vouchers                                that may be used for tuition at                                government-accredited human resources                                institutions.\\nLocsin, head of the BPA/P                                outsourcing trade group, claimed that government                                and private efforts had already started to address                                the problem. Perhaps predictably, he played down                                the labor shortage, chalking it up to media hype.                                \"I\\'ve met with several call centers lately, and                                they told me their hiring rate of fresh graduates                                who walk in to apply is now significantly higher                                at 8-10%,\" said Locsin. \"Last year, it was 2-4%.

Aquino penned Executive Order No. 118 creating the  Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts. Five years later, in 1992, this  presidential directive was enacted into law-- Republic  Act 7356 , creating the National Commission for Culture and the  Arts (NCCA). The original bill was jointly authored by Senators Edgardo Angara,  Heherson Alvarez, Leticia Ramos Shahani, and Congressman Carlos Padilla.\\nThe National Commission for  Culture and the Arts (NCCA), Philippines is the overall policy  making body, coordinating, and grants giving agency for the preservation,  development and promotion of Philippine arts and culture; an executing agency  for the policies it formulates; and task to administering the National  Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA) -- fund exclusively for  the implementation of culture and arts programs and  projects.\\nThe  government’s support for cultural development is particularly highlighted by  the passage of R.A. 7356 that created the NCCA. The  coordination among the cultural agencies was strengthened by the virtue of Executive  Order No. 80, which placed the Cultural  Center of the Philippines , the National Historical Institute (now, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines ), the National Museum , The National Library (now, The National Library of the Philippines ), and the Records, Management, and Archives Office  (now, the National Archives of the Philippines )  under the NCCA umbrella. Further,  through Republic Act No. 9155, administratively attached the earlier  aforementioned five cultural agencies to the NCCA, including now the Komisyon  sa Wikang Filipino / Commission on the Filipino  Language . Thus, the NCCA is responsible for culture and the arts in  the Philippines --- and, if not in the name, the de facto Ministry  of Culture.\\nThe  Commission together with the six cultural agencies works with the principle of  partnership, collaboration and shared responsibility in achieving effectively  and efficiently the implementation of cultural programs as well as maximizing  of resources.\\nThe NCCA was created to serve as the presidential  inter-agency commission to coordinate cultural policies and programs.\\nIV.

Olchondra\\nFiled Under: business process outsourcing (BPO)\\nHIGH salary and transfer rates in India are making that country less appealing to business process outsourcing (BPO) firms --a trend the Philippines can take advantage of by accelerating information technology (IT) training among students, an executive of a US firm said Monday.\\nJim Sanderson, vice president and chairman of applications developer Lawson Software, said India could readily provide large companies with 10,000 people or more with its big number of IT professionals but its BPO costs were rising 15 percent, compared with relatively stable costs in the Philippines.\\n?We see that small to medium sized companies looking to hire a few hundred to a few thousand professionals with three to five years? experience have a better environment in the Philippines,? Sanders told the Inquirer.\\nHe also noted that the attrition rate in India is about 30 percent, compared with 10 percent or so in the Philippines.\\n?A new Indian IT person expects to be promoted within six months and (to get) a 20-percent raise in six months, then another 20 percent on his first year, and so on,?

      "[0.0006462695316174414, 'Filipino\\nOrientation\\nIdentification. The Republic of the Philippines was named the Filipinas to honor King       Philip the Second of Spain in 1543. The Philippine Islands was the name       used before independence.\\nLocation and Geography. The Republic of the Philippines, a nation of 7,107 islands with a total       area of 111,830 square miles (307,055 square kilometers), is located on       the Pacific Rim of Southeast Asia. Two thousand of its islands are       inhabited. Luzon, the largest island with one-third of the land and half       the population, is in the north. Mindanao, the second largest island, is       in the south. The Philippines are 1,152 miles (1,854 kilometers) long from       north to south. The width is 688 miles (1,107 kilometers). There are no       land boundaries; the country is bordered on the west by the South China       Sea, on the east by the Philippine Sea, on the south by the Celebes Sea,       and on the north by the Luzon Strait, which separates the country from its       nearest neighbor, Taiwan. The closest nations to the south are Malaysia       and Indonesia. Vietnam and China are the nearest neighbors on the mainland       of Asia.\\nThe islands are volcanic in origin. Mount Mayon in southern Luzon erupted       in 2000. Mount Pinatubo in central Luzon erupted in 1991 and 1992. Both       eruptions caused destruction of villages and farms and displaced thousands       of people from their tribal homelands. Because the country is volcanic,       the small islands have a mountainous center with coastal plains. Luzon has       a broad central valley in the northern provinces along the Cagayan River       and plains in the midlands near Manila, the capital. Mindanao and Panay       also have central plains. Northern Luzon has two major mountain ranges:       the Sierra Madres on the eastern coast and the Cordilleras in the center.       The highest peak is Mount Apo in Mindanao at 9,689 feet (2,954 meters).\\nThe weather is hot because of the country\\'s closeness to the       equator. The temperatures are constant except during typhoons. The dry       season is from January to June; the wet season with monsoon rains is from       July to December. Temperatures are cooler in November through January,       dropping below 30 degrees Celsius (85 degrees Fahrenheit). The summer       months of April and May have temperatures in excess of 39 degrees Celsius       (100 degrees Fahrenheit). Typhoons occur from June through November.\\nDemography. The estimated population in July 2000 was eighty-one million. The average       life expectancy is sixty-seven years. Four percent of the population is       over age sixty-five. The most populous area is Metropolitan Manila, where       eight million to ten million people live.\\nLinguistic Affiliation. The official languages are Filipino, which is based on Tagalog with words       from other native languages, and English. Since only 55 percent of       residents speak Filipino fluently, English is used in colleges,       universities, the courts, and the government. The country\\'s seventy       to eighty dialects are derived from Malay languages. Three dialects are of       national importance: Cebuano in the southern islands, Ilocano in the       north, and Tagalog, the language of the National Capital Region. When       Tagalog was chosen as the basis for a national language, Cebuanos refused       to use Filipino. \"Taglish,\" a mixture of Filipino and       English, is becoming a standard language. Filipinos are proud that their       country has the third largest number of English speakers in the world.       Filipino English includes many Australian and British terms. It is a       formal language that includes words no longer commonly used in American       English. Spanish was taught as a compulsory language until 1968 but is       seldom used today. Spanish numbers and some Spanish words are included in       the dialects.\\nPhilippines\\nThe dependence on English causes concern, but since Filipino does not have       words for scientific or technological terms, English is likely to remain       in common use.\\nSymbolism. National symbols have been emphasized since independence to create a       sense of nationhood. The Philippine eagle, the second largest eagle in the       world, is the national bird. Doctor Jose Rizal is the national hero. Rizal       streets and statues of Rizal are found in most towns and cities. Several       municipalities are named for Rizal. The most prominent symbol is the flag,       which has a blue horizontal band, a red horizontal band, and a white       field. The flag is flown with the blue band at the top in times of peace       and the red band at the top in times of war. Flag ceremonies take place       once a week at all governmental offices. Schools have a flag ceremony each       morning. All traffic stops while the flag is being honored. The national       anthem is sung, a national pledge is recited in Filipino, and the provincial hymn is sung.\\nHistory and Ethnic Relations\\nEmergence of the Nation. Early inhabitants are believed to have reached the area over land bridges       connecting the islands to Malaysia and China. The first people were the       Negritos, who arrived twenty-five thousand years ago. Later immigrants       came from Indonesia. After the land bridges disappeared, immigrants from       Indo-China brought copper and bronze and built the rice terraces at Benaue       in northern Luzon. The next wave came from Malaysia and is credited with       developing agriculture and introducing carabao (water buffalo) as draft animals. Trade with China began in the first       century\\nC.E.\\nFilipino ores and wood were traded for finished products.\\nIn 1380, the \"Propagation of Islam\" began in the Sulu       Islands and Mindanao, where Islam remains the major religion. The Muslim       influence had spread as far north as Luzon when Ferdinand Magellan arrived       in 1521 to claim the archipelago for Spain. Magellan was killed soon       afterward when a local chief, Lapu-Lapu, refused to accept Spanish rule       and Christianity. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi landed in the Philippines in       1564 and consolidated Spanish power, designating Manila as the capital in       1572. Roman Catholic religious orders began Christianizing the populace,       but the Sulu Islands and Mindanao remained Muslim. The Spanish governed       those areas through a treaty with the sultan of Mindanao. The Spanish did       not attempt to conquer the deep mountain regions of far northern Luzon.\\nThe occupation by Spain and the unifying factor of Catholicism were the       first steps in creating a national identity. Filipinos became interested       in attaining independence in the middle of the nineteenth century. In the       1890\\'s, the novels of José Rizal, his exile to a remote       island, and his execution by the Spaniards created a national martyr and a       rallying         point for groups seeking independence. Armed attacks and propaganda       increased, with an initial success that waned as Spanish reinforcements       arrived. The Spanish-American War of 1898 and the defeat of the Spanish       fleet in Manila Bay led the Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo to declare       independence from Spain. The United States paid twenty million dollars to       the Spanish for the Philippines under the Treaty of Paris. Aguinaldo did       not accept United States occupation and fought until the Filipino forces       were defeated. In 1902, the Philippines became an American territory, with       the future president William Howard Taft serving as the first territorial       governor. Over the next two decades, American attitudes toward the       Philippines changed and the islands were given commonwealth status in       1933. Independence was promised after twelve years, with the United States       retaining rights to military bases.\\nThe Japanese invaded the Philippines early in 1942 and ruled until 1944.       Filipino forces continued to wage guerrilla warfare. The return of U.S.       forces ended the Japanese occupation. After the war, plans for       independence were resumed. The Republic of the Philippines became an       independent nation on 4 July 1946.\\nThe new nation had to recover economically from the destruction caused by       World War II. Peasant groups wanted the huge land holdings encouraged by       the Spanish and Americans broken apart. In 1955, Congress passed the first       law to distribute land to farmers.\\nFerdinand Marcos governed from 1965 to 1986, which was the longest period       for one president. From 1972 to 1981, he ruled by martial law. Marcos was       reelected in 1982, but a strong opposition movement emerged. When the       leader of the opposition, Benigno Aquino, was murdered after his return       from exile in the United States, his wife, Corazon Aquino, entered the       presidential race in 1986. Marcos claimed victory but was accused of       fraud. That accusation and the withdrawal of United States support for       Marcos led to \"People Power,\" a movement in which the       residents of Manila protested the Marcos regime. The Filipino military       supported Aquino, who was declared president, and the Marcos family went       into exile in Hawaii.\\nThe Aquino years saw the passage of a new constitution with term limits       and the withdrawal of U.S. military forces in 1991, when the government       did not grant a new lease for United States use of military bases.\\nFidel Ramos, the first Protestant president, served from 1991 to 1998.       Major problems included a fall in the value of the peso and the demands of       Muslim groups in Mindanao for self-determination and/or independence. The       government offered self-governance and additional funds, and the movement       quieted.\\nJoseph \"Erap\" Estrada was elected for one six-year term in       1999. The demands of the Muslim rebels escalated, culminating with the       kidnaping of twenty-nine people by the Abu Sayyaf group in April 2000.       Late in the year 2000, impeachment proceedings were brought against       Estrada, who was charged with financial corruption.\\nNational Identity. Filipinos had little sense of national identity until the revolutionary       period of the nineteenth century. The word \"Filipino\" did       not refer to native people until the mid-nineteenth century. Before that       period, the treatment of the islands as a single governmental unit by       Spain and the conversion of the population to Catholicism were the       unifying factors. As a desire for independence grew, a national flag was       created, national heroes emerged, and a national anthem was written. A       national language was designated in 1936. National costumes were       established. The sense of a national identity is fragile, with true       allegiance given to a kin group, a province, or a municipality.\\nEthnic Relations. Ninety-five percent of the population is of Malay ancestry. The other       identifiable group is of Chinese ancestry. Sino-Filipinos are envied for       their success in business. They have maintained their own schools, which       stress Chinese traditions.\\nSeventy to eighty language groups separate people along tribal lines.       Approximately two million residents are designated as cultural minority       groups protected by the government. The majority of those sixty ethnic       groups live in the mountains of northern Luzon. People whose skin is       darker are considered less capable, intelligent, and beautiful.       Descendants of the Negritos tribe are regarded as inferior.\\nUrbanism, Architecture, and the Use of Space\\nThe architecture of the islands shows Spanish influence. Spanish brick       churches built during the colonial era dominate the towns. The churches       are large and different from traditional construction. It is difficult to       imagine how the indigenous population in the seventeenth century was able       to build them.\\nFilipino families enjoy close kin bonds, and extended families             living together are the norm.\\nSeaports and government centers had a larger proportion of Spanish       buildings with wide verandas and tiled roofs. Towns destroyed during the       liberation campaign in World War II, especially in central and northern       Luzon, were rebuilt using wood. Areas of Manila destroyed during World War       II have been restored to their historical Spanish appearance. Newer       buildings in Manila range from standard multistory offices to       Western-style gated housing areas for the affluent, to tenements and       shacks.\\nTraditional houses in rural areas are nipa huts constructed of bamboo and roofed with leaves from palm trees or       corrugated metal. Cinder blocks are the most commonly building material       used. The blocks are plastered and painted on the inside and outside when       funds permit. Plasterers add decorative touches to the exterior. Older       houses have a \"dirty\" open-air kitchen for food preparation.       Newer, larger houses designate a room as a dirty kitchen in contrast to       the \"clean\" kitchen, which has an eating area where utensils       are stored. Enclosed kitchens provide a roof over the cook and keep dogs       and chickens from wandering into the cooking area. The roof is pitched so       that rain will run off. Middle-class houses and commercial buildings have       tiled roofs.\\nFood and Economy\\nFood in Daily Life. Filipinos do not consider it a meal if rice is not served. Plain steamed       rice is the basis of the diet. Three crops a year are harvested to provide       enough rice for the population, and the government keeps surpluses stored       for times of drought. Salt water and freshwater of fish and shellfish are       eaten daily, served either fresh or salted. Fish, chicken and pork are       usually fried, although people are becoming more health-conscious and       often choose alternative methods of cooking. Garlic is added to food       because it is considered healthful. Filipino food is not spicy. All food       is cooked on gas burners or wood or charcoal fires and is allowed to get       cold before it is eaten. Rice is cooked first, since it takes longer. When       it is ready, rice will be placed on the table while the next items of the       meal are prepared and served.\\nTable knives are not used. Forks and spoons are used for dining. The food       is eaten from a spoon. The traditional method of placing food on a banana       leaf and eating with one\\'s hands is also used throughout the       country. It is acceptable to eat food with one\\'s hands at       restaurants as well as in the home.\\nBreakfast is served at 6\\nA.M.\\nand consists of food left over from the night before. It is not reheated.       Eggs and sausage are served on special occasions.         Small buns called pan de sol may be purchased from vendors early in the morning.\\nAt midmorning and in the afternoon, people eat merienda. Since Filipinos are fond of sweet foods, a mixture of instant coffee,       evaporated milk, and sugar may be served. Coca-Cola is very popular. Sweet       rolls, doughnuts, or a noodle dish may be available. Lunch is a light meal       with rice and one other dish, often a fish or meat stew. Fish, pork, or       chicken is served at dinner with a soup made of lentils or vegetables.       Fatty pork is a favorite. Portions of small cubes of browned pork fat are       considered a special dish.\\nFruits are abundant all year. Several kinds of banana are eaten, including       red and green varieties. Mangoes, the national fruit, are sweet and juicy.       A fruit salad with condensed milk and coconut milk is very popular on       special occasions.\\nVegetables are included as part of a soup or stew. Green beans and       potatoes are commonly eaten foods. The leaves of camote, a sweet potato, are used as a salad and soup ingredient. Ube, a bland bright purple potato, is used as a colorful ingredient in cakes       and ice cream. Halo-halo, which means \"mixture,\" is a popular dessert that consists       of layers of corn kernels, ice cream, small gelatin pieces, cornflakes and       shaved ice. Patis, a very salty fish sauce, is placed on the table to be added to any of the       dishes.\\nFast food has become part of the culture, with national and international       chains in many towns. All meals at fast-food restaurant include rice,       although French fries also tend to be on the menu. Banana ketchup is       preferred, although the international chains serve tomato ketchup. A       national chain, Jollibee, has entered the U.S. market with a restaurant in       California, where many Filipino immigrants live. The company plans to       expand to other cities with Filipino populations.\\nFood Customs at Ceremonial Occasions. Léchon, a suckling pig that has been roasted until the skin forms a hard brown       crust, is served at important occasions. The inside is very fatty. Strips       of the skin with attached fat are considered the best pieces. The       importance of the host and the occasion are measured by the amount of léchon. served. Blood drained from the pig is used to make dinuguan\\nSticky rice prepared with coconut milk and sugarcane syrup is wrapped in       banana leaves. Glutinous rice is grown especially for use in this       traditional dessert.\\nGin and beer are available for men and are accompanied by balut, a duck egg with an embryo. Dog meat is a delicacy throughout the country.       It is now illegal to sell dog meat at markets because cases of rabies have       occurred when the brains were eaten.\\nBasic Economy. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing are the occupations of 40 percent of       the thirty million people who are employed. Light manufacturing,       construction, mining and the service industries provide the remainder of       employment opportunities. The unemployment rate is over 9 percent. Fifty       percent of the population lives below the poverty line. The Asian       financial crisis resulted in a lack of jobs, and the drought period of the       El Niño weather cycle has reduced the number of agricultural       positions. It is not uncommon for people to \"volunteer\" as       workers in the health care field in hopes of being chosen to work when a       position becomes available. People work seven days a week and take       additional jobs to maintain or improve their lifestyle or pay for a       child\\'s education. Eight hundred thousand citizens work overseas,       primarily as merchant seamen, health care, household, or factory workers       in Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Over Seas Workers (OSWs) have a       governmental agency that looks after their interests. Laws govern hours of       work, insurance coverage, and vacation time, but workers may be exploited       and mistreated. Recruitment centers are found in all large municipalities.       OSWs send $7 billion home each year, providing 4 percent of the gross       domestic product.\\nLand Tenure and Property. Nineteen percent of the land is arable and 46 percent consists of forests       and woodlands. Deforestation by legal and illegal loggers with no tree       replacement has reduced the number of trees. Large amounts of arable land       remain in the hand of absentee landowners who were given land grants       during the Spanish colonial period. Although land reform legislation has       been passed, loopholes allow owners to retain possession. Those       responsible for enacting and enforcing the legislation often come from the       same families that own the land. Peasant groups such as the HUKs       (People\\'s Liberation Army, or Hukbong Magpapayang Bayan ) in the 1950s and the NPA (New People\\'s Army) at the present time       have resorted to guerrilla tactics to provide land for the poor. There is       an ongoing demand to clear forests to provide farmland. The clearing       technique is slash and burn. Environmentalists are concerned because       timber is destroyed at random, eliminating the homes of endangered species       of plants and animals.\\nCommercial Activities. The local market is a key factor in retail trade. Larger municipalities       have daily markets, while smaller communities have\\nPhilippine children playing on Guimaras Island. Young children             typically live with grandparents or aunts for extended periods.\\nmarkets once or twice a week. Trade at the market is conducted in a       barter system. Suki relationships are established at the marketplace so that the buyer       returns to the same vendor. Markets are divided into \"dry\"       markets where clothing and household items are sold and       \"wet\" markets where food is sold. Sari-sari establishments are small neighborhood stores. They are convenient since       they have packaged products and are in the neighborhood, but no fresh       foods are available there. In larger towns, supermarkets with fixed prices       are adjacent to the market. Electronic equipment, furniture, and clothing       have fixed prices and are sold in stores or at kiosks. Shopping malls are       found in most provincial capitals. Malls with Western shops are found       throughout metropolitan Manila.\\nMajor Industries. Metropolitan Manila is the primary manufacturing area, with 10 percent of       the population living there. Manila and the adjacent ports are the best       equipped to ship manufactured goods. Manufacturing plants produce       electrical and electronic components, chemicals, clothing, and machinery.       The provinces produce processed foods, textiles, tobacco products, and       construction materials. Manufacturing in the home continues to be common       in remote areas.\\nTrade. Rice, bananas, cashews, pineapple, mangoes, and coconut products are the       agricultural products exported to neighboring countries. Exported       manufactured products include electronic equipment, machinery, and       clothing. The United States, members of the European Union, and Japan are       the major trading partners. Imports consists of consumer goods and fuel.       The country has mineral and petroleum reserves that have not been       developed because of the mountainous terrain and a lack of funding.\\nTransportation of products is difficult since the highway system beyond       metropolitan Manila consists of two-lane roads that are under constant       repair and sometimes are washed out by typhoons. Interisland shipping       costs add to the expense of manufacturing. Congress, governmental       agencies, and the financial community are attempting to find solutions to       these problems. The rate of road construction is accelerating and a light       rail system is planned. Filipino membership in the Association of South       East Asian Nations (ASEAN), a regional trade organization, is an important       factor in the development of trade policies.\\nDivision of Labor. In rural areas, lack of mechanization causes the entire family to work in       the rice fields. Planting rice seedlings, separating them, replanting,         and changing water levels in the fields are done by hand and are       labor-intensive. Crops such as tobacco, corn, and sugarcane demand full       family participation for short periods during the planting and harvest       seasons.\\nIn the cities, traditional roles common to industrialized countries are       followed. Men perform heavy physical tasks, while women work as clerks and       teachers and in health care.\\nSocial Stratification\\nClasses and Castes. Filipinos believe in the need for social acceptance and feel that       education can provide upward mobility. Color of skin, beauty, and money       are the criteria that determine a person\\'s social position. Light       coloring is correlated with intelligence and a light-skinned attractive       person will receive advancement before his or her colleagues. Family       position and patron-client associations are useful in achieving success.       Government officials, wealthy friends, and community leaders are sponsors       at hundreds of weddings and baptisms each year. Those connections are of       great importance.\\nThere is a gap between the 2 percent of the population that is wealthy and       the masses who live in poverty. The middle class feels too obligated to       those in power to attempt to make societal changes.\\nThe people of the Philippines enjoy watching professional basketball       played by American professional teams and teams in Filipino professional       leagues. Basketball courts are the only sport-site found in every barangay and school. Cockfights are a popular sport among men. Cocks have metal       spurs attached to the leg just above the foot. The contest continues until       one of the cocks is unable to continue fighting or runs away. Cuneta       Astrodome in metropolitan Manila is used for both professional basketball       and cockfights. Mah-jongg, a Chinese game played with tiles, is very       popular, especially with women.\\nSymbols of Social Stratification. Money to buy consumer goods is an indicator of power. Wealthy people lead       western lifestyles. They travel abroad frequently and pride themselves on       the number of Westerners they have as friends. Since few people outside       Manila have a family car, owning a vehicle is a clear statement of a high       social level. Houses and furnishings show a person\\'s social       position. Upholstered furniture instead of the traditional wooden couches       and beds, rows of electrical appliances that are never used and area rugs       are all important.\\nWomen above the poverty level have extensive wardrobes. Sending       one\\'s children to the best schools is the most important indicator       of social position. The best schools often are private schools and are       quite expensive.\\nPolitical Life\\nGovernment. The country has a republican form of government that was developed during       the commonwealth period. It contains three branches: executive,       legislative, and judicial. The first constitution, based on the United       States Constitution, was written in 1935. When President Marcos declared       martial law in 1972, that constitution was replaced by another one       providing for a head of state, a prime minister, and a unicameral       legislature. The president had the power to dissolve the legislature,       appoint the prime minister, and declare himself prime minister. A new       constitution was approved in a national referendum in 1987. It was similar       to the 1935 constitution but included term limitations. The 221 members of       the House may serve three consecutive three-year terms, which is also the       case for provincial governors. The twenty-four senators, who are elected       at large, may serve two consecutive six-year terms. The president serves       one six-year term, but the vice president may serve two consecutive       six-year terms. The president and vice president do not run on the same       ticket and may be political opponents.\\nThe seventy provinces have governors but no legislative bodies. Over sixty       cities have been created by legislation. Cityhood is desirable since       cities are funded separately from the provinces so that additional federal       money comes into the area. Each province is divided into municipalities.       The smallest unit of government is the barangay, which contains up to two       hundred dwellings and an elementary school. The barangay captain       distributes funds at the local level.\\nLeadership and Political Officials. Charges of corruption, graft, and cronyism are common among government       officials at all levels. People accept cronyism and the diversion of a       small percentage of funds as natural. Rewriting the constitution to       eliminate term limits and establishing a strong two-party system are the       reforms that are discussed most often. Politicians move from party to       party as the needs of their constituencies dictate because the political       parties have no ideologies.\\nMany of the people who are currently active in politics were politically       active in the commonwealth era. Men of rank in the military also move into       the\\nA house belonging to a family of the Igorot tribe in Bontoc. The             Philippines are home to approximately sixty ethnic groups in seventy             to eighty language groups.\\npolitical arena. Joseph Estrada, whose term as president is       1998–2004, entered the public eye as a popular film star. He then       became the mayor of a large city and went on to become vice president in       the Ramos administration. Previous presidents have had political or       military backgrounds, with the exception of Corazon Aquino, the president       from 1986 to 1992, who became politically active after her husband was       assassinated.\\nSocial Problems and Control. The formal system of law mirrors that of the United States. A police       force, which has been part of the army since 1991, and a system of trials,       appeals, and prisons are the components of the apparatus for dealing with       crime. Theft is the most common crime. Because the Philippines has a cash       economy, thieves and pick-pockets can easily gain access to thousands of       pesos. Petty thieves are unlikely to be apprehended unless a theft is       discovered immediately. Another common crime is murder, which often is       committed under the influence of alcohol. Guns are readily available.       Incest is punished severely if the victim is younger than fifteen years       old. Capital punishment by lethal injection was restored during the Ramos       administration. Six executions of men convicted of incest have taken place       since 1998. Illicit drugs are found throughout the archipelago but are       more common in the capital area and the tourist centers. Marijuana and       hashish are exported.\\nAn ongoing concern is the desire for autonomy among tribal groups.       Mindanoao and the Cordilleras Autonomous Region, where indigenous groups       are located, are allowed a greater degree of local control and receive       additional funds from the government. Muslim Mindanao has a strong       separatist movement. Terrorist groups have developed in support of the       movement. In the year 2000, terrorists engaged in acts of kidnaping for       ransom, a crime that is common in the country. The government deployed       additional military forces to attack terrorist strongholds.\\nMilitary Activity. The armed forces consist of an army, a navy, a coast guard, and an air       force. The army includes the Philippines National Police; the navy       includes the marines. Military service is voluntary. Public respect for       the military is high. Military expenditures account for 1.5 percent of the       gross domestic product. Current military activity is focused on terrorist       activity in Mindanao. The oil-rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea       are an area of concern that is monitored by the navy. The Spratlys belong       to the Philippines but are claimed by several other countries, and the       Chinese have unsuccessfully         attempted to establish a base there. In 1998, the Philippines signed a       visiting forces agreement that allows United States forces to enter the       country to participate in joint training maneuvers.\\nSocial Welfare and Change Programs\\nLand reform has been a concern since independence. Spanish and American       rule left arable land concentrated in the hands of 2 percent of the       population and those owners will not give up their land without       compensation. Attempts made to provide land, such as the resettlement of       Christian farmers in Mindanao in the 1950s, have not provided enough land       to resolve the problem. Until land reform takes place, poverty will be the       nation\\'s primary social problem. Eighty percent of the rural       population and half the urban population live in poverty. Governmental       organizations provide health clinics and medical services, aid in       establishing micro businesses such as craft shops and small factories, and       offer basic services for the disabled. The number of beggars increases in       times of high unemployment. People consider it good luck to give money to       a poor person, and so beggars manage to survive.\\nNongovernmental Organizations and Other Associations\\nWhile nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) work throughout the country to       solve social problems, they are most visible in metropolitan Manila, where       they work with squatters. The rural poor gravitate to urban areas, cannot       find a place to live, and settle in public areas, riverbanks and garbage       dumps. It is estimated that one of every four residents of metropolitan       Manila is a squatter. Shanty towns are so large that in 2000, when rains       from two successive typhoons made garbage dumps collapse, over two hundred       people were buried alive as their homes were swept away. Nongovernmental       organizations exert pressure on the government for land on which squatters       can build permanent housing. Forced evictions are another target of NGOs,       since an alternative place to live is not provided.\\nVolunteer agencies from the United States, the United Kingdom, the       Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Japan work with NGOs and governmental       agencies. Projects to help children and meet environmental needs are the       focus of volunteer efforts. Volunteer agencies are supervised by the       Philippine National Volunteer Service Coordinating Agency.\\nA farmhouse overlooks vegetables growing on a terraced field. In             these volcanic islands, mountains are common.\\nGender Roles and Statuses\\nDivision of Labor by Gender. Traditional roles prevail in rural areas, where men cultivate the land       but the entire family is involved in planting and harvesting the crops.       Women work in gardens and care for the house and children as well as       barnyard animals. In urban areas, men work in construction and machine       upkeep and as drivers of passenger vehicles. Women work as teachers,       clerks, owners of sari-sari stores, marketers of produce and health care providers. Occupational       gender lines are blurred since men also work as nurses and teachers. In       the professions, gender lines are less important. Women attorneys, doctors       and lawyers are found in the provinces as well as in urban areas.\\nThe Relative Status of Women and Men. While families desire male children, females are welcomed to supply help       in the house and provide a home in the parents\\' old age.       Women\\'s rights to equality and to share the family inheritance with       male siblings are firmly established and are not questioned. The oldest       daughter is expected to become an OSW to provide money for the education       of younger siblings and for the needs of aging family members. Women are       the familial money managers. The wedding         ceremony can include the gift of a coin from the groom to the bride to       acknowledge this role.\\nSince personal relationships and wealth are considered the road to       success, women have an equal opportunity to achieve. Winners of beauty       pageants are likely to succeed in the business and professional world,       especially if the pageant was at an international level.\\nMarriage, Family and Kinship\\nMarriage. Marriage is a civil ceremony that is conducted city offices. A religious       ceremony also is performed. The ceremony is similar to those in the United       States with the addition of sponsors. Principal sponsors are friends and       relatives who have positions of influence in the community. The number of       principal sponsors attests to the popularity and potential success of a       couple. It also reduces a couple\\'s expenses, since each principal       sponsor is expected to contribute a substantial amount of cash. Members of       the wedding party are secondary sponsors who do not have to provide funds.\\nArranged marriages have not been part of Filipino life. However, men are       expected to marry and if a man has not married by his late twenties,       female relatives begin introducing him to potential brides. The median age       for marriage is twenty-two. Young professionals wait until their late       twenties to marry, and engagements of five to seven years are not       uncommon. During this period, the couple becomes established in jobs, pays       for the education of younger siblings, and acquires household items. A       woman who reaches the age of thirty-two without marrying is considered       past the age for marriage. Women believe that marriage to a wealthy man or       a foreigner will guarantee happiness. Divorce is illegal, but annulment is       available for the dissolution of a marriage. Reasons for annulment include       physical incapacity, physical violence, or pressure to change one\\'s       religious or political beliefs. Interfaith marriages are rare.\\nDomestic Unit. The extended family is the most important societal unit, especially for       women. Women\\'s closest friendships come from within the family.       Mothers and daughters who share a home make decisions concerning the home       without conferring with male family members. One child remains in the       family home to care for the parents and grandparents. This child, usually       a daughter, is not necessarily unmarried. The home may include assorted       children from the extended family, and single aunts and uncles. Several       houses may be erected on the same lot to keep the family together.       Childcare is shared. Fathers carry and play with children but are unlikely       to change diapers. Grandparents who live in the home are the primary care       givers for the children since both parents generally work. Preschool       grandchildren who live in other communities may be brought home for their       grandparents to raise. Indigent relatives live in the family circle and       provide as household and childcare help. Young people may work their way       through college by exchanging work for room and board. Family bonds are so       close that nieces and nephews are referred to as one\\'s own children       and cousins are referred to as sisters and brothers. Unmarried adult women       may legally adopt one of a sibling\\'s children.\\nInheritance. Inheritance laws are based on those in the United States. These laws       provide that all children acknowledged by a father, whether born in or out       of wedlock, share equally in the estate. Females share equally with males.\\nKin Groups. Because of the closeness of the immediate family, all familial ties are       recognized. Anyone who is remotely related is known as a cousin.       Indigenous tribes live in clan groups. Marriage into another clan may mean       that the individual is considered dead to his or her clan.\\nPeople have a strong sense of belonging to a place. A family that has       lived in metropolitan Manila for two generations still regards a       municipality or province as its home. New Year\\'s Day, Easter, and       All Saint\\'s Day are the most important family holidays. Bus traffic       from Manila to the provinces increases dramatically at these times, with       hundreds of extra buses taking people home to their families.\\nSocialization\\nInfant Care. Infants are raised by family members. Young children are sent to live       with their grandparents or aunts for extended periods. People who live       outside the country leave their children with the family for the preschool       years.\\nInfants spend their waking time in someone\\'s arms until they can       walk. They are part of every activity and learn by observation. Someone       will remain in the room with them when they sleep. Infant mortality is       high, and so great care is taken of babies. Helpers and older sisters       assist with the dayto-day care of babies.\\nChild Rearing and Education. Children are seldom alone in a system in which adults desire company\\nWorkers spread rice on palm mats to dry in the midday sun. Filipinos             do not consider a meal complete without rice.\\nand do not understand the need for privacy. Children have no pressure to       become toilet trained or to learn to eat at the table. They are spoon fed       or eat from a parent\\'s plate until the age of six. They must learn       respect for authority, obedience, and religious faith. Self-esteem is       fostered. A child\\'s first birthday is celebrated with a party.\\nFilipinos regard education as the path to upward mobility. Ninety percent       of the population over ten years of age is literate. The Department of       Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) is the largest governmental       department. Approximately twelve million elementary school pupils and five       million secondary students attended school in 1999 and 2000. Education is       compulsory until age twelve. Statistics indicate that children from the       poorest 40 percent of the population do not attend school. Elementary       education is a six-year program; secondary education is a four-year       program. Pre-schools and kindergartens are seldom available in public       schools but are in private schools. Children are grouped homogeneously by       ability. First grade students begin being taught in Filipino; English is       added after two months. In elementary and secondary schools, reading,       science, and mathematics are taught in English while values, social       studies, and health are taught in Filipino. Children learn some Filipino       and English words from the media. \"Linga franca\" is an       experimental approach in which students are taught in the native dialect       and Filipino for the first two years and English in the third grade. This       program came about as a response to concerns that English was being used       more than were the native languages.\\nElementary school, secondary school, and college students are required to       wear uniforms. Girls wear pleated skirts and white blouses. Public school       pupils wear dark blue skirts. Each private school has its own color. Boys       wear white shirts and dark pants. Women teachers are given a government       allowance to purchase four uniforms to wear Monday through Thursday. Men       wear dark pants and a barong, a lightweight cotton shirt, or a polo shirt. Female teachers are       addressed as ma\\'am (pronounced \"mum\"). Male teachers       are addressed as sir. These titles are highly prized and are used by       teachers in addressing one another.\\nClass sizes range from twenty to more than fifty in public schools. The       goal is to keep class size below fifty. Pupils may have to share books and       desks. Schools may lack electricity and have dirt floors or be flooded in       the rainy season. The walls may not be painted. The Japanese, Chinese, and       Australians have provided new classrooms, scientific supplies, and teacher       training for the public schools. Private schools charge fees but have       smaller         class sizes. They have a reputation of providing a better education than       do the public schools.\\nComputers are not readily available in elementary or secondary schools       although DECS is stressing technology. President Estrada met with Bill       Gates of Microsoft to procure computers and software for use in the       schools.\\nClassrooms in both public and private schools have a picture of the Virgin       Mary and the president at the front of the room. Grottoes to the Virgin       Mary or a patron saint are found on school campuses. School days begin and       end with prayer.\\nThe school year runs from June to March to avoid the hot months of April       and May. School starts at seven-thirty and ends at four-thirty with a       break of one and a half hours for lunch. No meals are served at the       school, although the parent-teacher association may run a stand that sells       snacks for break time.\\nDropping out is a serious concern. In 1999 and 2000, the high school       dropout rate increased from 9 percent to 13 percent. The increase is       attributed to the need to provide care for younger siblings or to get a       job to enable the family to survive the high inflation and the currency       devaluation that followed the Asian financial crisis. The DECS has a       Non-Formal Education Division to meet the needs of out-of-school youth as       well as the needs of uneducated adults. Programs include adult literacy,       agriculture and farm training, occupational skills, and training in health       and nutrition. Programs for at-risk youth are being added at the high       school level. The Open High School System Act of 2000 is designed to       provide distance learning via television for youths and uneducated adults.\\nHigher Education. A college degree is necessary to obtain positions that promise security       and advancement. Approximately two million students attend colleges and       universities. Each province has a state college system with several       locations. The University of the Philippines, located in Manila, is a       public university that is regarded as the best in the country. Private       colleges are found in the major municipalities. The University of Santo       Tomas in Manila is a private school that was established in 1611; it is       the oldest site of higher education in the country. English is the primary       language of instruction at the college level. Colleges and universities       have large enrollments for advanced degrees since a four year degree may       not be sufficient to work in the higher levels of government service.\\nEtiquette\\nPeople believe that it is one\\'s duty to keep things operating       smoothly. It is very important not to lose face. Being corrected or       correcting another person in public is not considered acceptable behavior.       People want to grant all requests, and so they often say yes when they       mean no or maybe. Others understand when the request is not fulfilled       because saying no might have caused the individual to lose face. When one       is asked to join a family for a meal, the offer must be refused. If the       invitation is extended a second time, it is permissible to accept. Time       consciousness and time management are not important considerations. A       planned meeting may take place later, much later, or never.\\nFilipinos walk hand in hand or arm in arm with relatives and friends of       either sex as a sign of affection or friendship. Women are expected not to       cross their legs or drink alcohol in public. Shorts are not common wear       for women.\\nPeople pride themselves on hospitality. They readily go out of their way       to help visitors or take them to their destination. It is of the highest       importance to recognize the positions of others and use full titles and       full names when introducing or referring to people. Non-verbal language,       such as pointing to an object with one\\'s lips, is a key element in       communication. One greets friends by lifting the eyebrows. A longer lift       can be used to ask a question.\\nReligion\\nReligious Beliefs. The Philippines is the only Christian nation in Asia. More than 85 percent of the people are Roman Catholic. The rosary is said in the home       at 9\\nP.M.\\n, just before the family retires for the night. Children are introduced to       the statue of \"Mama Mary\" at a very early age.\\nProtestant missionaries arrived in 1901 and followed the Catholic example       of establishing hospitals, clinics, and private schools. The Church of the       Latter Day Saints (Mormons) is currently the most active missionary group.\\nSunni Muslims constitute the largest non-Christian group. They live in       Mindanao and the Sulu Islands but have migrated to other provinces. Muslim       provinces celebrate Islamic religious holidays as legal holidays. Mosques       are located in large cities throughout the country. In smaller       communities, Muslims gather in small buildings for services. Animism, a       belief that natural objects have souls, is the oldest religion in the       country, practiced by indigenous peoples in the mountains of Luzon.\\nA roundabout with a fountain sits between old buildings in Manila.             Some areas of the city were destroyed during World War II, when the             country was invaded by Japan and then liberated by the United             States.\\nFreedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution. The disagreement       between the Muslim population of the southern provinces and the federal       government is not so much about religion as it is about political goals.       Non-Catholics do not object to Catholic symbols or prayer in public       venues.\\nEach barangay has a patron saint. The saint\\'s day is celebrated by       a fiesta that includes a religious ceremony. Large amounts of food are       served at each house. Friends and relatives from other barangays are       invited and go from house to house to enjoy the food. A talent show,       beauty contest, and dance are part of the fun. Carnival rides and bingo       games add to the festivities.\\nReligious Practitioners. Religious leaders are powerful figures. Business and political leaders       court Cardinal Jaime Sin because of his influence with much of the       population. Local priest and ministers are so highly respected that       requests from them take on the power of mandates. A family considers       having a son or daughter with a religious career as a         high honor. Personal friendships with priests, ministers, and nuns are       prized. Clerics take an active role in the secular world. An example is       Brother Andrew Gonzales, the current secretary of DECS.\\nFaith healers cure illness by prayer or touch. \"Psychic\"       healers operate without using scalpels or drawing blood. The several       thousand healers are Christians. They believe that if they ask for a fee,       their power will disappear. Patients are generous with gifts because       healers are greatly respected.\\nRituals and Holy Places. The major rituals are customary Christian or Muslim practices. Sites       where miracles have taken place draw large crowds on Sundays and feast       days. Easter is the most important Christian observance. On Easter       weekend, the entire Christian area of the country is shut down from noon       on Maundy Thursday until the morning of Black Saturday. International       flights continue and hospitals are open, but national television       broadcasts, church services, and shops and restaurants are closed and       public transportation is sparse. People stay at home or go to church.       Special events take place on Good Friday. There are religious processions       such as a parade of the statues of saints throughout the community.\\nDeath and the Afterlife. A twenty-four-hour vigil is held at the deceased person\\'s home,       and the body is escorted to the cemetery after the religious ceremony. The       tradition is for mourners to walk behind the coffin. A mausoleum is built       during the lifetime of the user. The size of the edifice indicates the       position of the builder.\\nMourning is worn for six weeks after the death of a family member. It may       consists of a black pin worn on the blouse or shirt of the mourner or       black clothing. Mourning is put aside after one year. A meal or party is       provided for family members and close friends one year after the burial to       commemorate recognize the memory of the deceased.\\nAll Saint\\'s Day (1 November) is a national holiday to honor the       dead. Grave sites are cleared of debris and repaired. Families meet at the       cemetery and stay throughout the twenty-four hours. Candles and flowers       are placed on the graves. Food and memories are shared, and prayers are       offered for the souls of the dead. When a family member visits a grave       during the year, pebbles are placed on the grave to indicate that the       deceased has been remembered.\\nMedicine and Health Care\\nLife expectancy is seventy years for females and sixty-four years for       males. The Health Care Law of\\nPainted Jeepneys on a city street.\\n1995 provides citizens with basic health care at no cost through       subsidies. The working poor are given financial assistance when necessary.       Children receive inoculations at no cost. The World Health Organization       (WHO) declared the Philippines to be polio-free in 2000. It is the first       nation in the world to be recognized for the elimination of polio.\\nRegional public hospitals provide service to everyone. People who live far       away ride a bus for hours to reach the hospital. Funds for ambulances are       raised by lotteries within each barangay or are provided by congressmen       and are used only for the people who live in that area. Private hospitals       are considered superior to public hospitals. Paying patients are not       discharged from hospitals until the bill is paid in full. Patients have kasamas (companions) who remain with them during the hospital stay. Kasamas       assist with nursing chores by giving baths, getting food trays, taking       samples to the nurses\\' station and questioning the doctor. A bed       but no food is provided for the kasama in the hospital room.\\nThe infant mortality rate is 48.9 percent, and one-third of the children       are malnourished. Over 13 percent of preschool and elementary school       children are underweight. A government program provides nutritious food       for impoverished pupils at the midmorning break. This is only offered to       schools in the         poorest areas. National test scores are examined to see if improvement       has occurred. If the scores are better, the program is expanded.\\nThe most prevalent health problem is \"high blood\"       (hypertension). One in ten persons over the age of fifteen has high blood       pressure. Tuberculosis is another health concern; The country has the       fourth highest mortality rate in the world from that disease. Malaria and       dengue fever are prevalent because there is no effective program for       mosquito control. The number of deaths attributed to dengue increased in       the late 1990s.\\nHerbal remedies are used alone or in conjunction with prescribed       medications. A dog bite treated with antibiotics and rabies shots also may       be treated with garlic applied to the puncture. The study of herbal       remedies is part of the school health curriculum. Many elementary schools       have herb gardens that are planted and cared for by the students.\\nSecular Celebrations\\nNew Year\\'s Day is more of a family holiday than Christmas. It is       combined with Rizal Day on 30 December to provide time for people to go       home to their province. Midnight on New Year\\'s Eve brings an       outburst of firecrackers and gunfire from randomly aimed firearms.\\nOther national secular holidays are Fall of Bataan Day, an observation of       the Bataan Death March in 1942 on 9 April. Labor Day is celebrated on 1       May. Independence Day on 12 June celebrates freedom from Spanish rule. It       is celebrated with fiestas, parades, and fireworks. Sino-Filipinos       celebrate the Chinese New Year, which is not a national holiday, in       January or February. In Manila, fireworks and parades take place       throughout Chinatown. Muslims celebrate Islamic festivals.\\nArts and Humanities\\nSupport for the Arts. The government provides support for institutions such as the National       Museum in Manila. Libraries exists in colleges and universities. The best       collections are in Manila. Museums are located in provincial capitals and       in Manila. The Cultural Center of the Philippines in Manila is a center       for the performing arts that opened in 1970. It is a multibuilding complex       created under the direction of former first lady Imelda Marcos, who       encouraged musicians to enter the international community and receive       additional training. Nongovernmental organizations preserve the folk       heritage of the indigenous groups.\\nLiterature. Literature is based on the oral traditions of folklore, the influence of       the church and Spanish and American literature. Filipino written       literature became popular in the mid-nineteenth century as the middle       class became educated. The greatest historical literature evolved from the       independence movement. José Rizal electrified the country with his       novels. During the early years of American control, literature was written       in English. The English and American literature that was taught in the       schools was a factor in the kind of writing that was produced. Writing in       Filipino languages became more common in the late 1930s and during the       Japanese occupation. Literature is now written in both Filipino and       English. Textbooks contain national and world literature.\\nGraphic Arts. The Filipino Academy of Art, established in 1821, shows early art       reflecting Spanish and religious themes. Juan Luna and Felix Hidalgo were       the first Filipino artists to win recognition in Europe at the end of the       nineteenth century. Contemporary artists use a variety of techniques and       mediums to reflect social and political life. Crafts reflect the national       culture. Each area of the country has specialties that range from the       batik cotton prints of the Muslim areas to the wood carvings of the       mountain provinces of Luzon. Baskets and mats are created from rattan.       Textiles are woven by hand in cooperatives, storefronts, and homes. Banana       and pineapple fiber cloth, cotton, and wool are woven into textiles.       Furniture and decorative items are carved. Silver and shell crafts also       are created\\nSex and violence are major themes in films, which are often adaptations of       American screen productions. American films are popular and readily       available, and so high-quality Filipino films have been slow to develop.\\nPerformance Arts. Drama before Spanish colonization was of a religious nature and was       intended to persuade the deities to provide the necessities of life. The       Spanish used drama to introduce the Catholic religion. Filipino themes in       drama developed in the late nineteenth century as the independence       movement evolved. Current themes are nationalistic and reflect daily life.\\nDance is a mixture of Filipino and Spanish cultures. Professional dance       troupes perform ballet, modern dance, and folk dance. Folk dances are       performed at meetings and conferences and reflect a strong Spanish       influence. Indigenous dances are used in historical pageants. An example       is a bamboo dance relating a story about a bird moving among the reeds.       People enjoy ballroom dancing for recreation.         Dance instructors are available at parties to teach the waltz and the       cha-cha.\\nMusic performance begins in the home and at school. Amateur performances       featuring song and dance occur at fiestas. Popular music tends to be       American. Guitars are manufactured for export; folk instruments such as       the nose flute also are constructed.\\nThe State of the Physical and Social Sciences\\nThe physical sciences focus on the needs of the country. Aquaculture, the       development of fish and shellfish farms in coastal areas, is a rapidly       growing field. Centuries of fishing and dynamiting fish have changed the       balance of nature. Hormonal research to stimulate the growth of fish and       shellfish is a priority. Control of red tide, an infestation that makes       shellfish unsafe to eat, is another area of concentration. Agricultural       research and research into volcano and earthquake control are other areas       of study. The development of geothermal and other energy sources is       ongoing. Other environmental research areas of importance are waste       resource management, water resource management, and forest management. The       social sciences are focused on the needs of the country with the primary       emphasis on resolving the problems of poverty and land reform.\\nBibliography\\nDepartment of Education, Culture and Sports.

      "[0.0006028954906441981, 'Jose Rizal       dedicated his novel, \"El Filibusterismo\" to the three       priests, Mariano Gomez, 85 years, Jose Burgos, 30, and Jacinto       Zamora, 35, executed at Bagumbayan Field on February 17, 1872.\\nHistory books state that with this tragic       event, Philippine nationalism was born. The assumption is that,       before this date, the people did not feel they were one nation,       and any sign of protest against the foreign presence that was       Spain was a localized act of rebellion to which the rest of the       country did not relate.\\nThe execution of three Filipino       priests, one of them an octogenarian, for something nobody believed       they had anything to do with in the first place, stirred a current       of sympathy for the martyrs and of revulsion against the alien       rulers who could bring the ax down on the necks of the innocent.       After three and a half centuries of foreign domination characterized       by unenlightened government, outright exploitation of people       and natural resources, now and then half-hearted attempts at       reform and, on the part of the governed, sporadic and desultory       shows of resistance, the common enemy now took shape and the       people felt as one in their fight for the right to rule themselves,       shape their own destinies, and take the consequences.\\nFather Gomez, Father Burgos and Father       Zamora were summarily tried and sentenced to death by the garrote       for the Cavite arsenal revolt of January 20, 1872. The priests,       who were active in the fight for the secularization (or, in effect,       nationalization) of the clergy were creating trouble for the       despotic Governor Rafael Izquierdo and the powerful regular religious       orders in the country. By linking them with the uprising in the       Cavite arsenal, whether they indeed had anything to do with it       or not, the administration found a convenient way of doing away       with the troublesome trio.\\nWere the three really involved in the uprising?       Establishing the truth of the case will take painstaking investigation       since the records of the trial have disappeared and the star       prosecution witness himself had been ordered executed along with       the three against whom he testified. The question will probably       remain one of the great unsolved mysteries in the Filipinos\\'       fight for freedom. Until he breathed his last, Father Burgos       protested innocence of the crime imputed to him and Rizal, in       dedicating the Filibusterismo to the three condemned men,       underscored the doubt shared by the Filipinos over their guilt.\\nMsgr. Meliton Martinez, Archbishop of Manila,       was served a copy of the death sentences with a request that       the priests be defrocked. In reply, the archbishop said he needed       more convincing proof of their guilt and refused to be instrumental in effecting the crowning touch to their humiliation.\\nThe secrecy which shrouded the alleged       trials, the mysterious way records and papers of the court martial       findings had disappeared, and the suspicious haste with which       the sentences were carried out, contributed to the widespread       belief that the three had been condemned on trumped-up charges.       Sentenced to death on February 15, they were led to the garrote       two days later, on February 17.\\nBut even if irrefutable evidence against       Father Gomez, Burgos and Zamora had been cited, the three \\xad one an octogenarian known for the charities, another turned half-crazed       at the prospect of a ghastly death, and the third widely admired       for his courageous espousal of the rights of the Filipinos, in       particular the clergy \\xad would just the same have been looked       on as martyrs by their compatriots. The time was ripe for revolt       and the fact that the people believed that the executions were       a miscarriage of justice only hastened the march of history.       Public indignation rose to a peak. The job became easier for       those who had by now seen the necessity of uniting. The first       seeds of nationalism were sown and took root. The then constituted       authorities, in deciding to set the priests up as an example       to the populace of what was in the store for them if they continued       being insolent, were fast sealing their doom. The groundwork       for the inevitable revolution that was to come a quarter of a       century later was laid.\\nEdmund Plauchut, a Frenchman residing in       Manila at the time of the revolt, gives a dispassionate account       of it and its causes in an article published in the Revue       des Deux Mondes in 1877. He traced the immediate cause to       a peremptory order from the governor, Izquierdo, exacting personal taxes from the Filipino laborers in the engineering and artillery       corps in the Cavite arsenal, and requiring them to perform forced       labor like ordinary subjects. Until then, these workers in the       arsenal had been enjoying exemptions from both taxes and forced       labor. January 20, the day of the revolt, was payday and the       laborers found the amount of taxes as well as the corresponding       fee in lieu of the forced labor deducted from their pay envelopes.       It was the last straw. That night they mutinied. Forty infantry       soldiers and twenty men from the artillery took over command       of the Fort of San Felipe and fired cannonades to announce to       the world their moment of triumph. It was a short-lived victory.       Apparently, the mutineers had expected to be joined by their       comrades in the 7th infantry company assigned to patrol the Cavite       plaza. They became terror-stricken, however, when they beckoned       to the 7th infantry men from the ramparts of the fort and their       comrades did not make any move to join them. Instead, the company       started attacking them. The rebels decided to bolt the gates       and wait for morning when support from Manila was expected to       come.\\nBut Manila was quiet. What the Cavite rebels       had mistaken for a pre-arranged signal for the uprising coming       from the general direction of the city, turned out to be the       burst of rockets in celebration of the feast of St. Loreto, patron       of Sampaloc. Augustinian Friar Casimiro Herrera, writing a thesis       on the revolt later, was to say this was an \"act of Divine       Providence\", for the Sampaloc fiesta, traditionally celebrated       in December, had been postponed to January 20 that year.\\nInformed of the mutiny, Governor Izquierdo       dispatched two infantry regiments and an artillery brigade with       four cannons, under the command of General Felipe Ginoves Expinar.       General Ginoves arrived in Cavite by sea on the boats of Filipino,       Manila, Isabel I and Isabel II, to find the 7th infantry company       under the command of Lt. Col. Sawa successfully keeping the rebels       at bay in the front. From then on, it was just a matter of hours       before the mutineers, out-numbered, out-armed and ill-prepared       even in the matter of provisions to enable them to weather a       siege, began filing out of the fort waving the white banner of       surrender. But the first to march out were met by a volley of       shots from General Ginoves\\' men. They fell to a man and Gen.       Ginoves then ordered a charge into the fort. The rebels inside       the fort did not offer any resistance. Plauchut mentions a Spanish       friar (Father Antonio Ruffian of San Jose de Dios) whose presence       inside the fort \"has never been explained to date\",       as well as the Filipinos and the suicide of one of them. This       would tend to corroborate reports from other sources that the       Spanish officers in the fort as well as the men under them had       joined with the laborers in the revolt. These reports mention       Spanish Lts. Montesinos and Morquecho, who with a Sgt. Lamadrid,       took charge of the force of 200 marines and artillery men at       the arsenal. When General Ginoves and his soldiers arrived, it       was Sgt. Lamadrid who first tried to repel them. He died in the       attempt. Other accounts, however, conflict with these reports.       They state that the rebels themselves put to death the Spanish       officers inside the fort, as well as the wife of one of them       and her maid.\\nThat those who staged the revolt in the       San Felipe fort were counting on help from comrades in other       military establishments in Cavite and Manila is highly plausible.       The native soldiers in these establishments had long been chafing       from discrimination in treatment. One of Governor\\'s Izquierdo\\'s       first acts on taking over the reins of the government was to       order the fusion of the two artillery battalions in Manila. One       of these was composed of Spaniards (peninsulars) and the       other of mestizos and Filipinos. Before the fusion, the two battalions       were being maintained separately and independently of each other       to avoid clashes that would arise because of the differences       in race. Governor Izquierdo not only ordered the two merged,       but decreed that the peninsulars would form the first       companies and the Filipinos, second. He also filled all vacancies       for the posts of corporals and sergeants with Spaniards. When       the two battalions were being maintained separately, the natives       were blissfully unaware of the fact that their Spanish comrades       in other battalions were getting better pay and better food.       With the merger, the discriminations became obvious. The feeling       of discontent spread. The Cavite uprising was one of the manifestations       of this dissatisfaction over conditions in the army. It could       very well have been part of a concerted plan to revolt among       the native elements in the rest of the military establishments.\\nWhen he quickly quelled the revolt, Governor       Izquierdo demonstrated the futility of mutiny. He should have       rested on his laurels, assured that the other discontented groups       contemplating similar acts of defiance would have learned their       lesson and desisted from resorting to violence. But Governor       Izquierdo had to turn the incident into a terrible example that       the insolent filibusters (as anyone who showed any radical tendencies       was then called) should never forget. Apparently, Governor Izquierdo       had a dossier on who the filibusters were. He had them all rounded       up, their homes searched thoroughly and their letters intercepted.       The Council of War set up a court martial under Manuel Boscasa.       Some seventy people were condemned to death. Later, several of       the death sentences were commuted to exile or imprisonment. Among       those banished to far off and lonely Marianas Islands were Antonio       Maria Regidor, Maximo Paterno. Agustin Mendoza and Joaquin Pardo       de Tavera. Given jail terms were Maximo Inocencio, Enrique Paraiso       and Crisanto de los Reyes. Doomed to the garrote were the three       priests, Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, as well as one Francisco       Saldua. The latter had been the principal informer against the       three priests. His statement had been the main basis for the       convictions and he had been promised pardon in exchange for his       testimony. To his consternation, however, he was condemned along       with the three. His was the first of the heads to roll on February       17.\\nThe court martial proceedings appear to       be highly anomalous. Evidence to support the charges did not       accompany the decision which merely stated that the court had       found them guilty of conspiring to overthrow the government and       proclaim a Republic of the Philippines, with Father Burgos as       president. The defendants were given a counsel chosen by the       court. The counsel, a Dr. Jose Arrieta, on reading his brief,       said it was not possible to defend Father Burgos because he had       already confessed. The priest was surprised on hearing the \"defense\".       He protested, \"That is not my defense. The course has changed       it. I have not confessed and I deny every charge brought against       me as having no foundation in fact or in act.\"\\nThat Governor Izquierdo committed a blunder       when he had the priests executed and the other suspects exiled       or otherwise sentenced for scarcely proved complicity in the       Cavite revolt, is something that most historians admit. If Governor       Izquierdo had desisted from such punitive action, the revolt       would not have attained the importance it was to take on subsequently.       One may not guarantee, however, that otherwise, the fire of nationalism       would not have caught on and spread. As it happened, with the       execution of the three priests, Governor Izquierdo was merely       setting the pattern for his reign of terror, only too well known       in Philippine history. The fuse was ready, all that remained       to be done was set it off.\\nAbroad, events had in fact been working       up to the Cavite revolt. Spain herself had just undergone a revolution.       Four years earlier, in 1868, the queen had been dethroned and       a Republican had been installed. The revolution in the mother       country had repercussions in the Islands. In 1869, the liberal       Governor de la Torre was sent over. All progressive-minded elements       in the country were to enjoy a brief spell of liberalism under       the new governor. There was going to be freedom of speech and       the Governor even encouraged his subjects to visit with him at       his Sta. Potenciana palace and exchange views on how the government       should be run. The loss of Spanish colonies in the Americas at       about this time resulted in the displacements of a great number       of government officials and employees. These were soon to find       their way to the only colony left, the Philippine Islands. The       opening of the Suez Canal was to facilitate this influx of newcomers       who were to bring with them modern ideas of government and the       spirit of reforms then pervading in the mother country as well       as throughout Europe and the new world.\\nOne articulate       historian writes of the period. Not until the nineteenth century       would the Filipino nation present a united, self-conscious front.       The rarefied air from Europe had found its way into the nipa       hut. The red beret of the liberated Frenchman had its counterpart       in the red ribbon worn by the Señora Maria de Sanchez,       hostess of the Manila celebration of the new Spanish constitution.       Pouring in lieu of the invalid wife of the liberal Governor de       la Torre, she presented a strange, exciting sight to the heretofore       repressed Filipino. On the ribbon wound around her hair were       printed the words \"Long Live the Sovereign People\" and around her neck a red tie bore the message \"Long Live       Liberty\" at one end, and \"Long live General la Torre\" on the other. On a frivolous ribbon around a Castillian señora\\'s       hair was the slogan that would send many a Filipino who was present       at the reception, among them Father Jose Burgos, to jail or to       the garrote.\\nBut liberalism was not going to last long       in Spain, and certain circles in the Islands, who looked on the       radical ways of Governor de la Torre as a serious threat to their       existence, were going to conspire to have him removed. These       circles were typified by the Augustinian friar, Herrero, who,       assuming an \"I told you so\" attitude in his thesis       on the Cavite revolt, was to say later, \"The insurrection       at Cavite has the same origin and result as those in France,       Spain, Italy, American and other European countries. They are       all fruits of the corruption of the intelligence and of the heart       . . . The freedom to think and the freedom of the press which       brought bitter fruits in Spain were transported to these islands       and they were encouraged by ambition, passions and ignorance       of men . . . \"\\nOn April 4,, 1871, De la Torre was replaced       by Izquierdo. The moment the new governor took over the reins       of government, he made it clear that the regime he was going       to establish was one of total reaction to De la Torre\\'s liberal       policies. But the seeds of liberalism and of desire for reform       had been sown and these were to thrive, even more so, under Izquierdo\\'s       oppressive rule. It is a lesson of history that revolutionary       movements feed on tyranny.\\nFather Burgos, then a coadjutor in the       Manila Cathedral, had been very active in the fight for the retention       of Filipino curas in parishes. This dispute over parishes       between the seculars (the curas) and the regulars (members of       religious order) is best explained in a letter Archbishop Martinez       of Manila sent the Regent of the King in Madrid at the height       of the dispute, shortly before the Cavite revolt. The archbishop,       as head of the parishes, naturally sided with the seculars and       warned that the controversy had better be resolved to their satisfaction       if it was desired to stave off a deterioration of the situation       with unfortunate results. Because the seculars were native priests, mestizos or creoles, and the regulars were peninsulars,       the dispute over the parishes was eventually to take on racial       overtones.\\nArchbishop Martinez traced the beginnings       of the religious question to the issuance of the Cedula of July       8, 1826. This ecclesiastical order emanation from Madrid authorized       the transfer of administration of the parishes in the Islands       from the seculars to the regulars. The seculars had been occupying       these parishes since fifty years ago, when there was a shortage       of priests from Spain. Few of the Spanish priests like the idea       of coming to the wilds of the Philippines, and the local church       authorities were forced to train natives to become priests and       administer the parishes. The 1826 cedula naturally affected the       seculars adversely, since then they were to be demoted to mere       auxiliaries and sacristanes while the friars were to take       over as heads of the parishes. In almost all instances, however,       there was virtually no transfer of work: the native priests still       carried on the actual work of the curas, while the friars,       enjoying the privileges of curas, only took charge of       the soft job of receiving the moneys due the curates from the       parishioners. A second Cedula issued on March 9, 1849, authorized       the transfer of seven specific parishes in Cavite from the seculars       to the regulars. The last straw was the Royal Order of September       10, 1861 giving all curates in Cavite and Manila to the members       of the Recollect Order. The Royal Order was issued to recompense       the Recollects for loss of benefices in Mindanao which had been       given to the Jesuits, just returned from exile. The Jesuits,       banned from Spain and the Indies (the Philippines included) in       1767, were restored to favor in 1861. There were limited to missionary       work, however, and in the Islands were assigned to Mindanao,       then in the administration of the Recollects. To compensate the       Recollects, they were awarded the lucrative parishes in Manila       and Cavite at the expense of the native clergy which had hitherto       been holding them.\\nThere were other instances of what the       historians of the time called despoliation, which was the awarding       of lush plums to favored parties to the discrimination of underdogs.       When the priest of San Rafael, Bulacan, a native, died, his curate       was given over to the Augustinians. Curates of Zambales, Bataan       and Pampanga, long held by native priests, were given over to       religious corporations. Father Burgos led the protests against       what he charged were intrusions on the part of the regulars into       what properly and legally belonged to the local clergy. He organized       a clerical party to fight for secularization. The party subsidized       the newspaper El Eco Filipino, published in Madrid, which       became the organ of the champions for secularization of the churches       and later of civil reforms. Burgos and his followers argued that       the turning over of the parishes to the regulars contravened       the provisions of the Council of Trent agreement which expressly       prohibited the friars from holding curates. Under the Trent agreement,       only secular priests were supposed to hold parishes and administer       the spiritual needs of the populace while regulars were to live       in their monasteries and devote their time to religious contemplation       and to missionary and educational work.\\nThe regulars on the other hand countered       that the seculars were not competent to hold the parishes and       that, moreover, they had been holding these curates at the indulgence       of the Crown in Madrid which had the right to take away at its       pleasure. What really made the curates such a big bone of contention,       besides of course the fact that they were good sources of revenues,       was the fact that those holding them became spheres of influence,       social and political, in the communities. The regulars, realizing       that they would be reduced to political impotence if they retired       to their monasteries, refused to give up the parishes that they       had maneuvered to get from the native priests through high-powered       and obviously successful lobbying in Madrid. It was this friar       faction which believed to have insisted on laying the extreme       penalty for Father Burgos, his fellow cura del sagrario in the Cathedral, Jacinto Zamora, and the octogenarian Gomez,       for complicity in the Cavite Revolt. In one fell swoop, they       would do away with an annoying threat to the comfortable positions       they had been able to wangle from Madrid, as heads of the most       lucrative parishes in the Islands.\\nBut the stories circulated that the evidence       against the three priests had been fabricated, and that in fact       the revolt had been instigated by the friars (Friar Ruffian\\'s       presence in the besieged fort San Felipe was never satisfactorily       explained) to frame up Burgos, Gomez and Zamora. One take (noted       in Blair and Robertson\\'s The Philippine Islands Vol. 11)       was that some friars had brought from Zambales a native who looked       like Father Gomez, rigged him up in priest attire and thus managed       to implicate the good man in the mutiny.\\nThese stories were to serve as fodder to       the steadily growing fire. Because those put to the garrote for       a crime never satisfactorily proved included a creole (Burgos),       a half-Chinese (Zamora) and a pure-blooded Tagalog (Gomez), the       various elements represented by these three races, saw in the       unjust execution a common cause which was not just creole, or       mestizo, or indio (as natives were then deprecatingly termed).       Up to then, these various groups had held each other in distrust,       a result of the \"divide and rule\" policy maintained       by most despotic regimes and so successfully practiced by the       peninsulars in the Islands. With the executions, Burgos, Zamora       and Gomez emerged as martyrs. The various active groups became       bound in anger over the atrocity and on this union was laid the       foundation for a Filipino nation. Some of the liberal elements       had been advocating mere assimilation with Spain (the country       to take on the status of a province). Now they were asking themselves       whether assimilation, and not complete independence to run their       lives and their country, was what they wanted.\\nAustin Craig in his Lineage, Life and       Labors of Rizal recalls that Father Burgos\\' ante mortem advice       to the Filipinos was for them to seek education abroad because       only through education could they hope for progress. It was advice       that was well taken. Rizal, whose older brother, Paciano, was       a close friend of Burgos, was soon to leave his native shores       for Madrid and other points overseas, where he was to crystallize       his ideas for reform.\\nMeantime,       the laymen who had also been implicated in the revolt and punished       with exile to the Marianas, were to escape to places like London,       Hongkong and Tokyo, where the air was much more progressive.       Here they were to start Filipino communities where many a plot       to liberate the \"patria adorada\" was very likely hatched.       Some of these exiles were to return to their country, and their       contact with liberally-run governments was to open their eyes       wide to the despotism in Manila. These were the men destined       to take historic roles in 1898.\\n\\xa0\\n', 74]\n",

I am particularly excited that Kimi Dora almost made the list.  I am not a big fan of Joyce Bernal but I just love Eugene Domingo and Chris Martinez.  Chris Martinez I believe wrote Kimi Dora as well as Here Comes the Bride.  However, I think 100 was his best film and I just hope you got to see and maybe it would have been part of the list (as watching the movie is a requirement for it to be on the list).\\nThe brilliance of having a melodramatic topic for a movie (100) but injecting the right kind of humor on some scenes will make Chris Martinez one of the best in the industry in the coming years.  I\\'ve watched 3 of the films he wrote and directed(I am not sure if he did more) and I enjoyed every single one of them.\\nI am sure, this comment will raise some eyebrows with some readers.

Although I always believe that it is easy to make people cry but it\\'s really hard to make people laugh.  And for a Chris Martinez, who can make a full movie house laugh out loud in chorus is nothing short of amazing.  By this time, I know some of the eyebrows of some readers reached the tip of their widow\\'s peak however, I think I have to put a disclaimer that this opinion is very personal.  I have not met Chris Martinez and he did not pay me to write this.  These set of words is coming from a guy who was born early 90s and learned to appreciate movies in the mid 2000 already, where Lino Brocka and all those great filmmakers in the 70s and 80s are no longer making films.  I\\'m part of the generation who, some would qualify, as unlucky enough to catch some of these titles in the cinemas.

      "[0.0005606485020780885, '5. Interpersonal Heterosexual Behaviors\\nA. Children\\nIn Filipino society today, it is not unusual for preteenage boys to engage in exploratory \\x93sex\\x94 games with other boys and girls. Such exploratory play allows the child to reassure him/herself of the normality of his or her body. This kind of childhood sexual rehearsal games was more common in the past and in rural areas, when violence and drugs were not as devastating as they are now in the urban areas. In some cases, boys would observe couples kissing and hugging in the park. Occasionally, they sit in the balconies of movie theaters where couples are engaging in heavy petting. In the rural areas and barrios, boys commonly compare their bodies with a friend, relative, or schoolmates. Generally speaking, parents and other adults have a mildly negative response when they discover child sexual play, ranging from warnings to spankings.\\nB. Adolescents\\nOur knowledge of the sexual attitudes and behaviors of the Filipino youth is limited to a very few anecdotal reports, most of which deal with middleand upper-class urban teenagers rather than the rural poor and urban street children. In this very limited context, my personal experience was the basis of my premedical school thesis on \\x93First Night Sexual Experience of Young Boys - 1968.\\x94 This study consisted of personal interviews with 80 adolescents in the rural areas of Cebu during social dances and summer festivals. The majority of these teenagers were interested in obtaining information regarding nocturnal emissions, love, sexual intercourse, and, for women, contraception and pregnancy. Most of the males\\x92 ideas on sexuality were derived from older boys, brothers, and their uncles. On the other hand, the girls were too timid or shy to answer the sexuality questions.\\nDuring the author\\x92s return visit to the Philippines in July 1995 as an invited speaker at a college sociocultural conference, he arranged an impromptu meeting with middle and high school students, grades seven through ten. They informed me that most of their teachers believed that they were too young to hear about sex education. The teachers did not allow questions from their students during the lecture on \\x93family education.\\x94 Most instructors were too insecure and embarrassed, and so were unable to facilitate any in-depth dialogue. In Catholic Filipino society, the Christian dogma still has a strong influence on the teachers\\x92 moral and religious values, so that, despite the presence of a government-mandated educational climate, sexuality remains taboo in public discussion. Unfortunately, these teenagers were afraid to elaborate further, confessing only that it is attitudes like this, repeated in their conservative homes, that make them view society and family cynically.\\nIn Christian colleges and universities, being pregnant out of wedlock can result in expulsion. In most public non-sectarian universities, sex education is still mostly non-existent except for those basic biological courses and family planning programs mandated by the government in 1972. However, in the largest government-run university, the University of the Philippines, sex education courses are more in-depth and liberal, because of the sophistication of the instructors and department heads who are Westernized and comfortable with controversial and sensitive ideas.\\nAlthough still limited, some might say elementary, sexuality courses in most urban medical schools are generally open to updating because of the infusion of new ideas from visiting professors and experts in periodic international forums and conferences. The best medical school students can graduate as doctors at the young age of 23, a factor that makes their communications with patients about sexual issues difficult at best.\\nPubertal Rites for Boys\\nThe anatomical and physiological changes that herald puberty are universal to the human race. However, in Filipino society, the sociocultural pubertal rites are expressed in a variety of customs and traditions depending on the particular subculture and its religious orientation. In the Christian tradition, the custom is to circumcise all males. Male circumcision is performed either by a medical doctor trained in this surgery or by a traditional medicine man. Filipino boys may be circumcised as newborn infants or somewhere around age 8 to 10 years, when they are in the third or fourth grade. City dwellers and the sophisticated elite have their newborn males circumcised before they are discharged from the hospital. Working class and poor families seldom have their newborns circumcised, but usually wait until the boys are 9 or 10 years of age. The medicine man is not a medical doctor, but a man of ordinary skills who has learned the art of circumcision handed down from his father or grandfather.\\nCircumcision is done in two ways. In superincision, a dorsal-mesal cut is made along the length of the upper surface of the penis, from the base to the foreskin, or only on the top of the foreskin. In the coronal technique, the excess foreskin is removed with a circular incision, as is the practice in Europe and North America. When a medical doctor performs either of these types of circumcision, the incision is closed by sutures and oral antibiotics are prescribed to avoid post-operative infection. The medicine man, on the other hand, only performs the dorsal slit circumcision, using a specially \\x93cleaned\\x94 (not sterilized) sharp knife or a modified slender \\x93machete\\x94 as scalpel. The medicine man uses neither antibiotics nor anesthesia.\\nThis pubertal initiation traditionally occurs in the spring or when the schools begin summer recess, somewhere in May or June. The ceremony commences when boys, aged 8 to 12 years old, march in procession, usually in groups of ten to twelve, to the medicine man\\x92s house. The medicine man, with the parents\\x92 knowledge and consent, will then lead the boys to a secluded place, a clearing in a thicket or on a farm to insure privacy. The boy with pants removed, is seated on the edge of a rock or stump of a tree, while the medicine man sharpens and cleans the knife. Despite this tension-producing build-up, the boy must remain calm and composed to show that he is brave and ready to enter the new realm of adulthood and can handle the rigors of manhood. The medicine man places the knife\\x92s sharpest side underneath the tip of the excess prepuce (avoiding the glans penis). He instructs the boy to look up, saying \\x93look for a bird or a plane,\\x94 diverting his attention. In a split second, a piece of wood or a branch is struck down against the knife, resulting in a midline cut or dorsal slit of the prepuce. Bleeding may be profuse or minimal. The juice of a certain tropical palm plant (nipa palm) is squeezed over the wound as a post-surgical anesthetic and caustic agent to stop the bleeding. No wound dressing is applied to cover the fresh and rugged incision. A clamp of cobwebs or a mesh scraped from the underside of a coconut palm branch over the incision serves as a bandage and additional clotting agent (to stop further bleeding). In some parts of the Philippines, the medicine man spits on the wound pre-chewed tobacco or a concoction of guava (a tropical peach-like fruit) leaves to act as a clotting agent. Both the cobwebs and coconut palm scrapings act as mechanical meshes to trap blood platelets in order to stop bleeding. The guava leaves mixed with saliva has papase, a chemical agent that medically can minimize post-operation swelling and sometimes arrest bleeding.\\nAfter circumcision, the boys walk home without a sound of complaint or grimace of pain. It is interesting to note that a particular gait can be discerned before and after the circumcision. The boys naturally walk normally on their way to the medicine man\\x92s house. When they walk back to their homes, their gait is characterized by a \\x93frog-like\\x94 walk, in which the knees are spread away from each other in order to avoid the thighs touching the newly circumcised genitalia. For three to five days, the circumcised boys stay home. Some wear skirts borrowed from their sisters or mothers, not pants, so that clothes do not touch or accidentally hit the sensitive, partially exposed glans (head) penis. Despite daily wound washing in the ocean, a river, or stream, about 90 to 95 percent of these cases of non-sterile circumcision become infected. It takes about six to eight weeks for the wound to heal, usually without ugly scars or deforming penile skin adhesions.\\nIn the 1970s, Muslim boys were not usually circumcised unless their parents were well-educated and health-aware of Westernized attitudes of that time. In the early 1950s, boys of minority families in the north were not circumcised. However, with the arrival of foreign Christian missionaries and their conversion to Christianity, most of the boys are now circumcised either by a medicine man or a physician.\\nPuberty Rites for Young Females\\nChristian girls undergo two phases of social transition to womanhood: ritual ear piercing and a cotillion or debutantes\\x92 ball. Ear piercing is neither a religious nor a pubertal rite. It is just a custom, a traditional \\x93tribal\\x94 rite of socially announcing that the person is a girl. The piercing of the ear is usually done between one month after birth and 2 or 3 years of age. In some parts of the country, the girl is much older. Ear piercing is usually done by a hair stylist, a \\x93medicine woman,\\x94 or medical person. Outpatient procedures by medical personnel use properly sterilized needles. Oftentimes, however, no anesthesia or antibiotic is given when the piercing is done by a hair stylist or a medicine woman. In general, however, infections from ear piercing are not as common as in male circumcisions done by a medicine man with an unsterilized knife. Phase two, the debutante\\x92s ball or cotillion, is a social introduction of young females ages 16 to 18 years in the form of an elaborate party or dinner dance. The hostess of this social event is an 18-year-old female usually from the rich families. Cotillion is an old Spanish tradition, dating back to colonial days, when the daughters of foreign dignitaries or tenured Spanish government officials were introduced to the eligible bachelors of the equally rich in order to secure the daughter\\x92s future financial and sociopolitical status as eligible and eminently suitable future wives.\\nIn the Muslim or Moros community, about 10 percent of the Filipino population, the ear-piercing ritual is the same as among Christians. In the early 1950s, the older girls would wear a veil. At present, young females seldom use veils or cover their faces. Some Muslims include the cotillion in their rite of passage, but for others, dancing or any form of partying is absolutely prohibited and considered sacrilegious.\\nThe minorities, Ifugaos, Kalingas, Igorots, and others, account for 3 to 5 percent of the population. These females, like most Filipinas, have their ears pierced at any early age. However, in some tribes, family wealth and status are demonstrated by the number of earrings or the layers of necklaces worn. No form of female circumcision or genital mutilation has been recorded. Anecdotal reports suggest that during the pre-Hispanic colonial days, some tribal females wore multi-appendage rings, nose, and lip rings. These tribal cultures do not observe the cotillion.\\nPremarital Sexual Activities\\nSexual attitudes and behavior differ from one group of Filipino youth to another, depending on their social class, educational level, and place of residence. In metropolitan and large cities, Manila, Quezon, Cebu, Iloilo, Davao, Dumaquete, and Zamboanga, adolescents and young adults are exposed to the cosmopolitan life and consequently receive more information on sex and sexuality. They are also freer to experience numerous options than are less educated youths. Youth in small towns have narrower and more restricted ideas on sexuality, because of the family\\x92s and Church\\x92s strong control and influence. Furthermore, youngsters in big cities have easy access to adult magazines and entertainment, in which sexuality is openly discussed or shown, even though their parents and the Church try to hide such information from them. The majority of urban youth knows about contraceptives and can acquire these from pharmacies or from friends without problems. Despite the guilt and shame associated with sex, middle- and upper-class urban youth often engage in sexual contacts with girlfriends, household maids, and even prostitutes. For the youths of the poverty belts around the big cities, the situation is compounded by the lack of money and self-control. Even if they would prefer to use a contraceptive, they cannot afford them and there are no places where they can get them free. Oral contraceptives are only given free to married women for family planning purposes by government-run city and municipal health clinics. Although condoms were distributed freely in public high schools in the early 1990s on a mandate from the Secretary of Health as part of an STD and HIV prevention program, this practice was later discontinued because of a public outcry that it was ineffective and because of the Church\\x92s persistent objections.\\nThe situation for rural (barrios) youth is quite different. They learn and receive information about sex and sexual behavior from observing farm animals, from magazines, from clandestine \\x93boys only\\x94 meetings, and from the relations between parents and other family members in homes where there is little privacy. The prevailing Catholic dogma on sexual morality is written deep in the unconsciousness of every boy and girl. Only a few years ago, 98 percent of the youth associated premarital sex with guilt and sin. Only recently has this begun to change. In 1994, the Youth Adult Sexuality Survey (Zablan 1994) revealed that about 18 percent accepted premarital sex, although a majority of 80 percent still believed it was a sin and morally unacceptable.\\nOnly a few general surveys about the sexual life of younger Filipinos exist; most of what is known is based on anecdotal reports. The author\\x92s experiences are with interviews of preselected groups of the youth population conducted during periodic sojourns back to the Philippines. The samples mainly consist of middle-class youth, ages 17 to 22, who were encouraged to bring to the meeting problems related to their sexual lives and development. Repeatedly, they expressed regret that these aspects of their lives that engender so much anguish and fears could not be explicitly discussed in the intimacy of their household.\\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that first premarital sexual activities are initiated at an earlier age, especially for those in metropolitan areas, where the basic family structure often disintegrates because of a lack of parental supervision, with both parents working or the father absent and perhaps working overseas. Young males pursuing college and graduate studies in the city are often detached from parental supervision and frequently succumb to the lure of metropolitan temptations, go-go bars, and adultentertainment houses. Twenty to 25 percent have their first sexual experiences with prostitutes, either out of peer pressure or curiosity. In a few cases, youths in smaller communities who impregnate their girlfriends may be forced to marry them or make an amicable financial arrangement with parental approval. The woman usually keeps the child in her parents\\x92 home instead of giving it up for adoption.\\nIn the Muslim communities, premarital sex is absolutely prohibited. But young girls, ages 14 to 16, can be betrothed through the usual (parental) marriage arrangement, mainly to affluent and much older bridegrooms.\\nAmong girls, the memories of being deflowered were somewhat different from those of the boys. Because of guilt and shame, the majority of young females did not bother to get prior information about sexual intercourse and the possible consequences of their first sexual encounters. They perceived their first intercourse as the fulfillment of young love, motivated by peer pressure to keep their boyfriends, and at the same time as a \\x93challenge\\x94 to parental authority or a gross transgression of a religious or social taboo. For the well-educated and sophisticated city dwellers, it was a calculated act to get rid of the old-fashioned social taboo (virginity), which they perceived as an obstacle to entering into a more mature and fulfilling sexual life, or plainly to catch the men of their dreams. It is interesting to note that, compared with the United States and other industrialized nations, Filipino teenagers are probably less sexually active; thus teenage pregnancy is less of a problem than elsewhere.\\nMost of the children born to single mothers are kept in the teenager\\x92s mother\\x92s home, instead of being given up for adoption. In the 1970s, a pregnant teenager was a social outcast and was subjected to severe parental scorn. However, in the 1990s, because of Western influence and financial difficulties, a pregnant teenager is somewhat more tolerated, and her parents are less condemning and more accepting of any financial help the teenage father might offer.\\nC. Adults\\nCourtship, Dating, and Relationships\\nAs mentioned previously, Chinese influence runs deep and the majority of Filipinas adhere to its simple social dictum, \\x93Get married at a marriageable age.\\x94 Marriage is considered the natural conclusion of a stable heterosexual relationship. Recently, however, Filipinos have started to replace their old-fashioned social concepts with ones that recognize that the right to remain single is as much a personal right as the right to marry. Because of the Western influence on women\\x92s liberation, to be a single older woman is no longer considered a social disgrace or the result of any personal inadequacy.\\nCohabitation\\nThe colonial view of the sacredness of marriage includes a strong social condemnation of cohabitation for unmarried couples. Thus, cohabitation was relatively rare during the 1940s. The social and legal implications of \\x93common-law marriage\\x94 (cohabitation) are not significant in a society of less affluence and resources. Furthermore, the definition of unmarried used in compiling official statistics makes it difficult to estimate the popularity of this behavior in the sense it is understood in the Western Hemisphere. Beginning in the late 1980s, the increased tolerance of non-marital cohabitation in the West began to influence the middle-aged and younger generations. During the author\\x92s 1996 visit in the provinces of Cebu, Leyte, and metropolitan Manila, there was an estimated increase of half a percent and an estimated 340,000 couples in unmarried cohabitation. The majority of cohabiting couples in the provinces are separated from their legal spouses because divorce is illegal and they cannot be civilly or religiously married. The rest are college students, youth, artists, and intellectuals who are attracted to this lifestyle.\\nCourtship is a cherished Filipino tradition with certain specific rules based on religious, sociocultural, and family values. There are five widely shared rules or \\x93commandments\\x94 associated with courtship:\\nSay \\x93yes\\x94 to the first invitation.\\nIt is a prerequisite to have an escort, either a friend or next of kin, on the first date (no escort is necessary for a woman 28 years or older.\\nIt is all right to publicly demonstrate decent affection, such as kissing, touching, and caressing.\\nA young Filipina should reserve criticism after the first date, be discreet about her feelings, and the man must cover (pay for) all expenses.\\nIf dating leads to marriage, one must remember that marrying entails marrying into the spouse\\x92s whole family as a clan.\\nThe majority of young men and women believe that love, physical attraction, similar religious beliefs, and trust are the basic essentials in creating and maintaining a stable relationship.\\nAdults, Marriage, and the Family\\nThe marriage ceremony is usually preceded by an engagement. For the rich and middle class, betrothal is marked with elaborate parties. On the other hand, the low-income class concludes the occasion with a firm handshake and/or a sip of a local wine or homemade ferment. The engagement and wedding are usually a happy, festive occasion. However, if questions of family honor and shame arise, the outcome may be violent and deadly, as happened at the time of this writing, when a male\\x92s family massacred the bride-to-be\\x92s family because she slept with another man two days before the wedding. The community accepted the outcome as a proper punishment for the betrayal and unbearable shame caused to the bridegroom\\x92s family.\\nWhereas the legal age for voting is 21 years for both males and females, the legal age for marriage is 21 for males and 18 for females. In the Muslim community, the parents of a girl between ages 14 and 16 may betroth her to an older man. Generally, in the Christian community, the courts do not consider pregnancy a valid motive to grant permission for the marriage of a minor. Legislation has also abolished the possibility of reparatory marriage; in the past a person accused of rape or forceful abduction could avoid punishment by marrying the victim. In the southern end of the archipelago, where the majority of the Muslims live, a dowry is agreed on before a formal marriage arrangement is signed. The dowry, given by the bride\\x92s parents to the groom, may be a large sum of money, property, or a sizable wedding present.\\nMuslim marriages are conducted by a judge or an imam (a religious cleric), Christian marriages by a priest or pastor. Civil marriages are recognized and accepted in both the Christian and Muslim communities when conducted by judges and commercial chiefs, such as pilots and ship captains.\\nAlthough polygyny had a long history in pre-colonial Filipino civilization and was common in the Muslim community prior to the 1970s, polygynous marriages are the exception today. The majority of sophisticated, highly educated males, whether Muslim or Christian, choose to be monogamous for financial reasons. Middle- and upper-class Filipino families also elect to have fewer children, two on average, as compared to three or more for the less educated and low-income families.\\nWith the advance of information technology, foreigners seeking brides with traditional values can now surf the Internet for a modest fee. Companies also advertise \\x93mail order brides\\x94 in different magazines and specialty journals. There are currently about 100 companies competing to lure mail-order bride customers, such as \\x93Cherry Blossoms,\\x94 \\x93Asian Rose,\\x94 and \\x93Exotic Girls.\\x94 The service charge can range from a basic $150 to upwards of $2,500. For $150, the bridegroom-to-be will receive a brief biographical sketch and a photo or video of the woman. He can correspond with her in letters or even phone calls. He can arrange to go to the Philippines and see her at his own expense. For $2,500, the services include airfare, hotel accommodations, and a two- or three-day tour to personally interact with the candidate bride(s). The client is introduced to different women during a party and the couples can interact socially.\\nA major shortcoming of this venue for finding a mate is that the interested males are not screened properly. These men can be psychopaths, criminals, or worse. In some cases, a syndicate of \\x93Internet bride-merchants\\x94 sells young women aged 14 to 18, oftentimes with fake birth certificates, for a mere $3,000. These women are admitted to the United States on a fianc�e\\x92s visa. Parents with severe income hardship frequently sign the contract believing that their daughters will either be given a job opportunity or be future brides of these unscrupulous foreigners. Recently, a congressman from the state of New Jersey sponsored a bill in the United States Congress to severely restrict the issuing of these \\x93fianc�e\\x92s visas\\x94 and to stop the practice of \\x93bride-to-be/sex slave\\x94 businesses. Newspaper reports and embassy communiqu�s have documented that many young Filipino mailorder and Internet brides are held captive, raped, divorced, and then pressed into prostitution.\\nThere are no credible published data on marital sexual satisfaction or on the status of Filipino marital life. According to the author\\x92s informal survey and radio-talk-show interviews in 1995, 15 to 20 percent of Filipinos are unhappily married. Women, more often than men, reported having sexual intercourse not because they desired it, but to please their spouses. Whereas 35 percent of males would like to increase the frequency of sexual intercourse, especially those in their 20s and 30s, most of the women were satisfied with the frequency of sex; only 5 percent of the females were interested in more frequent sex. These gender differences may be explained as the result of a greater pressure on males for sexual performance to maintain their macho image and maintain total control over women.\\nA majority of women complained of the brief duration of foreplay and premature ejaculation. Sexual intercourse is limited almost exclusively to penetration, which is more common among the less educated, more devotedly religious couples, and the older age groups. The average duration of foreplay is about five minutes, that of coitus about five to six minutes. On the other hand, the more educated, sophisticated, younger age group, and the \\x93unchurched\\x94 have a longer duration of sexual foreplay and coitus, about twenty-two minutes. Although premature ejaculation is not uncommon among males, very few men seek medical help. Husbands generally do not consider premature (early) ejaculation a problem.\\nIn the Christian community, sexual activity is not prohibited during any religious event or celebration. In some cases, Christian women make the personal choice of not having sex during their menstrual period. On the other hand, Muslim custom does not allow any sexual activity during the menstrual period, between sundown Friday and sundown Saturday, and during Ramadan, the month-long period of daytime fasting.\\nIt is difficult to gather data on female orgasm because of religious repression and personal shyness. It is believed that Filipinas\\x92 sexual satisfaction is based on cultural and religious grounds. The husband\\x92s satisfaction is primary and the wife\\x92s orgasm clearly secondary. Young, educated, and less religious or unchurched women have a higher orgasmic rate as compared to their older, less-educated, (oftentimes) more religious, and shy counterparts. It is believed that for a majority of women who experienced orgasms, it was more a result of psychological and religious expectation and not so much because of oral or manual genital stimulation. However, the barrage of media and Western influences has increased the proportion of Filipinas who prefer both psychic and physical stimulation. Filipinas are bombarded by the mass media and performing arts with messages about more openness in sexual matters, greater gender equality, information about new techniques for lovemaking, new roles within the couple, and new opportunities for extramarital relationships. These issues are also conversation matter among friends and families, at business meetings, and at almost any social-civic gatherings.\\nDivorce and Remarriage\\nThe Catholic Church does not allow divorce of any kind, but it will grant annulments, which most Filipinos find socially distasteful. However, generally, we find civil decrees of legal separation, divorce, and annulment are becoming more socially acceptable for Christian and Muslim Filipinos. A civil divorce requires that the ex-husband support the children and provide some assistance to the ex-wife along with household maintenance.\\nSlightly more acceptable are consensual separations. What is popular today is having a court declare a marriage null and void under the Family Code (Executive order 209, article 36). The Family Code has adopted the grounds of \\x93psychological incompatibility\\x94 as a basis for civil annulments. This was the criterion for annulment articulated by the Catholic Church forty years ago after the Vatican II Council, when annulments became much more common. A civil annulment dissolves the marriage and leaves both parties free to remarry. With the incidence of annulments clearly increasing in the mid-1990s, Filipino Senator A. D. (Nikki) Coseteng introduced in the legislature a pro-marriage anti-divorce bill (no. 179), which now legally defines marriage as an inviolable social institution and the foundation of the family.\\nThe incidence of remarriage is not presently known. However, both in the rural and metropolitan areas, cohabitation is on the upswing because of Western influences and financial problems. In major cities, younger, more sophisticated, and affluent women have more chances for remarriage, but priests will not officiate at a second marriage ceremony unless the Catholic Church has annulled the previous marriage. Despite liberalization in the dissolution or annulment of marriages, the main reason why the divorce rate is still relatively low, when compared to the industrialized countries, is most likely the pervasive influence of the Catholic Church and parental moral values. The importance of extended family norms derives, not only as a source of emotional support and the context for the development of profound personal relations, but also for many other aspects of social life, from financial support to finding a job. Legal separation, divorce, and annulment are still frequently perceived as evidence of personal failure and as a \\x93social anomaly.\\x94 The end of the relationship is not viewed as freedom and independence, but as the beginning of a different period in one\\x92s personal life.\\nExtramarital Sexual Activities\\nMost of the causes of legal separation involve extramarital affairs. Adultery or extramarital sex is vehemently condemned by the Catholic Church and is socially detested. However, there is an issue of legal terminology and social definition. Under Filipino penal laws, a man does not commit adultery unless he violates the law against concubinage. To be guilty of concubinage, a man must:\\nkeep a mistress within the conjugal dwelling;\\nhave sexual intercourse with another woman under scandalous circumstances; or\\ncohabit with another woman outside the conjugal dwelling.\\nHaving sexual intercourse with a women who is not one\\x92s wife does not in itself violate the law of concubinage. Nor is the ban on concubinage violated if a man fathers a child with a woman who is not his wife. A wife commits adultery simply by having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband, regardless of the circumstances.\\nThe provisions of the Penal Code on female adultery and male concubinage are glaring examples, not only of the inequality between the sexes, but also of the inequity between erring spouses. The law provides a maximum penalty of four years imprisonment for the erring husband. The concubine shall be meted a penalty of destierro, wherein she is prohibited from setting foot within the man\\x92s residence. A wife found guilty of adultery, on the other hand, may be imprisoned for a maximum period of six years. Some lawmakers have pointed out that it is easier to send a female to jail and that this violates the constitutional provision on equality of the sexes. In simple terms, the law does not criminalize the sexual infidelity of a married man except under certain circumstances. This, some lawmakers point out, seems to imply that the extramarital affairs of men are acceptable as long as they are discreet in handling them - a clear reflection of the double standard mentality of society with regard to sexual infidelity.\\nA 1996 survey conducted by an advertising and research group revealed that out of 485 married men in metropolitan Manila, 51 percent admitted having had extramarital affairs. The survey results reflect the machismo culture in the Philippines, wherein a man\\x92s worth, among other things, is also equated with his ability to lure other women. In an attempt to correct this inequality in 1997, Senator M. Santiago filed a bill simplifying marital infidelity. In her measure, she proposed that the extramarital sex by either the husband or wife be called adultery, whether the extramarital partner is of the other or same sex. The House committee made amendments to her bill and put the marital offense under a single crime called \\x93marital infidelity,\\x94 eliminating the separate provisions on concubinage and adultery, and the consideration of whether the infidelity occurs within the couple\\x92s home or elsewhere. Congress proposed a maximum penalty of six years for all parties concerned. Speaking for the Women\\x92s Legal Bureau, a non-governmental organization (NGO), E. Ursua claimed that imposing criminal liability on the offenders is not the answer. \\x93We do not think criminalizing is the proper solution. We can\\x92t force someone to be faithful.\\x94\\nThe new law penalizes the guilty party with imprisonment, regardless of the reasons behind the infidelity. A woman escaping from an abusive or violent relationship, or one who simply falls out of love and finds growth and fulfillment with another person, is treated no differently than a man who keeps several mistresses. In effect, the law also punishes individuals who get out of marriages that are bereft of love, respect, and trust. Some legal organizations propose a modified \\x93divorce\\x94 law and/or a new bill to decriminalize sexual infidelity. But Senator Santiago countered that this might send a \\x93subliminal message\\x94 to the youth that the state is encouraging \\x93free love.\\x94\\nIn the Muslim world, adultery is severely punished, with the perpetrators either made social outcasts or, in rural villages, stoned to death in public. This \\x93fatal justice\\x94 is carried out clandestinely as an expression of community justice that government magistrates (datu) can do nothing to either prevent or punish. The whole village maintains a \\x93code of silence,\\x94 because this punishment is written in the Muslim moral marital law. There is no witness to interrogate or testify.\\nDuring the Spanish colonial days, 1775 to 1899, rich Filipinos who owned haciendas (estates or a large parcel of land) and employed several female domestic helpers could easily have extramarital relations with their female employees, with or without the knowledge of their wives. Today, we still find married men in all walks of life who maintain a long-standing relationship with a second woman, oftentimes with the knowledge and approval of their spouses, and even of their grown children. In some cases, an extramarital affair can end a politician\\x92s career; in other cases, an affair, even when its makes headlines, may have no political consequences. Some couples find extramarital affairs a solution that keeps their marriage alive. The man may be freed to satisfy sexual needs he does not dare, because of religious restrictions, reveal to his wife, while the wife is relieved of any pressure to change her sexual behavior. Most wives who adopt this compromise have limited horizons in their lives and a very low sexual appetite. Less common is a marriage in which both the husband and wife have extramarital relationships by mutual knowledge and agreement. In such cases, usually the husband has a job that keeps him abroad for long periods of time, with periodic visits to wife and family. Occasionally, Filipinos who married, found employment abroad, immigrated for a few years, and married a second woman while abroad, bring their second wives back when they return and set up a second household in a different dwelling. Discovery of this bigamous affair can be costly if the courts become involved. Legal penalties for bigamy can bring up to four years in prison and fines for moral and psychological damages between $500 and $1,300 US.\\nThese relationships pose a serious problem in Philippine society because many of these men resist the use of condoms, do not practice safe sex, and pay no attention to the possibility that their regular or occasional partner(s) may be HIV-positive.\\nIncidence of Oral and Anal Sex\\nBoth the Christian and Islamic sects abhor oral and anal sex acts. The Muslim tradition specifically requires the husband to enter the wife by natural means in penile-vaginal intercourse. Oral sex, which in the past was condemned as \\x93unnatural,\\x94 is practiced more or less by educated Christians who live in the metropolitan areas. From the 1950s to the 1970s, when there was no constant supply on electricity in many towns and areas of the country, professional couples enhanced their sexual lives by using pornographic and specialty magazines. In the 1970s and 1980s, with electricity more widely available, middle-class and upper-class couples used film projectors, and later videocassette players, to enhance their sexual repertoire and learn about alternatives to penile-vaginal intercourse that could bring renewed vigor to their routine sex lives.\\nAnecdotal reports suggest that oral sex is practiced by 10 to 15 percent and tried by 20 percent of the professional couples (i.e., doctors, lawyers, and businesspersons who travel a lot). The majority of Filipinos, however, still consider oral sex as dirty and unnatural. For the few who engage in oral sex, cunnilingus is acceptable, but Filipinas will only very rarely engage in fellatio. In general, older and lower-class Filipinos have a more negative view of oral and anal sex.\\nModern Filipino youth, however, seem to be taking a new look at Westernized sexual expressions, according to what they said at the author\\x92s impromptu meetings. Although no general survey data are available, a segmental study of metropolitan youths revealed two groups of young women based on their responses. One group accepts and practices oral sex as a way of avoiding the risk of pregnancy, maintaining their technical virginity until marriage, and/or as a form of safer sex. For the second group, oral sex was a more intimate form of sexual relationship, somehow more \\x93romantic\\x94 than genital intercourse. Youths holding the latter view believed that oral sex should be only engaged in with a stable (engaged to be married) partner and not in the first few exploratory encounters or dates. Some other older girls joined some boys in rejecting this way of expressing love, and thought that only prostitutes could practice fellatio on boys.\\nWhereas anal intercourse is not part of the fantasies for the majority of devout Christian women, anecdotal reports revealed that 30 to 40 percent of males fantasized about having anal sex with women other than their wives. Prejudices against anal sex are even stronger in less educated youths. Most of the youths I spoke with do not accept anal sex even after marriage, perhaps influenced by the increasing incidence of AIDS in the Orient. Older boys agreed that a woman will never ask for it.\\nIES - Countries - The Philippines  - Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\\n', 134]\n",

Broad-based economic expansion was achieved in a low inflation environment,\" it said.\\nHefty remittances, which encouraged robust domestic consumption, along with steadfast growth in farm output, compensated for slower exports, economists said.\\n\"We had a very strong first half last year. It has slowed a bit in the second half on uncertainty over the US economy, but robust dollar remittances sustained the growth story,\" said Jonathan Ravelas, an economist at Banco de Oro-EPCI Inc.\\nFrom January to November, dollar remittances by Filipinos working abroad rose 14.1 percent from a year before to $13.1 billion.\\nThe central bank expects remittances coursed through banks to hit $14.3 billion in 2007, 10.8 percent more than the $12.9 billion sent home in 2006.\\nRemittances peak before Christmas as more than eight million Filipinos overseas send more money to their families at home to spend for the holidays.\\nThese inflows are also strengthening the peso, which last year gained 18.8 percent against the US dollar.\\nSTURDY FARM SECTOR\\nThe economy was also boosted by a resilient farm sector, which endured a prolonged dry spell to record 4.7 percent growth, within government\\'s projected growth range of 4.5-5.0 percent.\\nAgriculture accounts for about a fifth of the domestic economy.\\nThe government said agriculture grew 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, faster than the 1.6 percent expansion a year before. The boost came from a late surge in production of rice and corn, the country\\'s major food crops.\\n\"Domestic demand continued to be strong in the last quarter. We expect strong agriculture growth to be the supply-side driver of GDP growth,\" said Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING.\\nThe typical acceleration in exports in the last quarter \"is likely to make net exports less of a drag in GDP growth,\" he said.\\nIn the first 11 months of last year exports rose just 4.8 percent from a year before. The reduced target for the whole year is 8 percent.\\nElectronics exports, which accounted for 61.3 percent of total export earnings in November, fell to 2.42 billion dollars from 2.54 billion dollars a year earlier.\\n\"The steady appreciation of the peso has been hurting the competitiveness of Philippine exports,\" said David Cohen, chief economist at Action Economics Asia in Singapore.\\n\"As a result, China and other Asian exporters are getting more of the export activity.\"\\nWhile the economy breezed though the tumult in the financial markets last year, there will be more headwinds in 2008, some economists said.\\n\"The external environment will be quite challenging. We are seeing a modest deceleration of the economy as a result of slower export growth, a softening of domestic consumption partly due to rising inflation and partly due to a gradual deceleration of remittance growth,\" said Frederic Neumann, an economist of HSBC in Hong Kong.\\nHSBC is projecting 5.9 percent GDP growth in 2008.\\nBut the country\\'s improving fundamentals should cushion some of the external shocks, Neumann said.\\n\"What is remarkable, unlike previous downturns, is that the Philippine economy\\'s sound fundamentals will enable it to better ride out his year\\'s tough environment.\"\\nLOWER EXPORTS\\nEconomists agree that a recession in the US will be a drag on the Philippine economy.\\nThe Philippines, despite having diversified its export markets, still considers the US its main trading partner.\\n\"Exports will likely struggle in the first half as demand for electronics could exhibit a downturn on the back of slowing consumer demand, a consequence of the weakness in the US which, if it continues, will also hit the global economy,\" said Neumann.\\nAside from being a key export market, the US is also home to the lion\\'s share of overseas-based Filipinos who send money home.\\n\"A weakness in global demand will shrink the growth in remittances. It will take a bit of the steam out of remittance growth,\" said Neumann.\\nOther economists have a more positive view.\\n\"The picture is cloudy, but the recent moves by the US government and the Fed should make an impact in the coming months,\" said Cohen of Action Economics.\\nThe Philippine government\\'s push for increased spending this year should mitigate the effects of a global economic downturn, said Ravelas of Banco de Oro-EPCI.\\n\"Fiscal pump-priming activities should help temper the uncertainty because of increased global risks,\" he said.\\nThe peso\\'s strength, the government\\'s healthier finances, a credit rating outlook upgrade and low interest rates should also reduce the vulnerability of the economy.\\nMoody\\'s said Friday its outlook for the Philippines\\' key credit ratings and ceilings has been upgraded to positive from stable because of progress in stabilizing public-sector finances and the government\\'s easing dependence on external financing. Consequently, Moody\\'s also upgraded the outlook for its ratings for eight Philippine banks to positive from stable.\\nThe following are the forecasts for fourth-quarter, 2007 and 2008 GDP growth given by five economists.\\n-- Action Economics - 6.3 percent, 6.9 percent, 5.5 percent\\n-- Banco de Oro-EPCI - 6.5-7.0 percent, 6.5-7.0 percent, 6.5-7.0 percent\\n-- CIMB-GK - 5.8 percent, 6.7 percent, 5.1 percent\\n-- HSBC - 6.4 percent, 6.9 percent, 5.9 percent\\n-- ING Bank - 6.5 percent, 7.0 percent, 6.2 percent\\nCopyright 2011 Thomson Financial.

Its use of food and color to signal the growing romance between the two characters is at once breathtaking, hunger-inducing, and subtle. The ending, of course, is a let-down of corniness that sends shivers down our spine, reminding us at the end that this is still a Star Cinema film–but for a while there, we were enchanted.\\n9. Libingan\\nDirected by Ramon del Prado for Tuldok Animation, 2007\\nA little girl from the city goes home to the province with her mother, meets some bullies who steals her cellphone, and gets led to a nearby forest where she has the biggest encounter of all–with primeval beings that spring straight from our forgotten folklore. That this is all told in whimsical animation reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki is incredible. The Philippines is not quite known for its animated films–and what few that came, Gerry Garcia\\'s Isko: Adventures in Animasia (1995) and Robert Quilao\\'s Dayo (2008) did not exactly gain a huge following. Mr. Del Prado may be the future game changer for Filipino animation.\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n8. Ang Lihim ni Antonio\\nDirected by Joselito Altarejos for Viva Digital and Beyond the Box, 2008\\nThere\\'s no question about it: the subgenre of queer cinema is here to stay. They make too much money, which has led to quickie filmmaking cashing in on the trend, giving us films that are sometimes precious (Cris Pablo\\'s Boylets) or atrocious (Joel Lamangan\\'s Walang Kawala). Altarejo\\'s second queer film–a tragedy involving a boy, his mother, and his uncle–tapped into the well of queer unconscious and became perhaps the most popular film of its genre. Of course we\\'ve had groundbreaking–and perhaps even better made–gay films before. Contributions by Brocka (Ang Tatay Kong Nanay), Mel Chionglo (Sibak), Danny Zialcita (T-Bird at Ako), Gil Portes (Miguel/Michelle), Carlitos Siguion-Reyna (Ang Lalake sa Buhay ni Selya), and even the documentaries of Nick Deocampo (Oliver) easily spring to mind. But Antonio is a vivid experience because it is also both a story of growing up and coming out. That it is also sexually explicit adds to its notoriety. It ends with what many consider to be needless tragedy, but if you think about it, it may be the filmmaker giving us a necessary disapproving shake of the head, as if he\\'s saying, \"Sure, you find all these sexy now\"–and then pulls the rug right off our unsuspecting feet. Genius.\\n7. Bata Bata Paano Ka Ginawa?\\nDirected by Chito S. Rono for Star Cinema, 1998\\nI can\\'t believe that there was a once-upon-a-time when a Star Cinema imprimatur was a seal of \"fearless\" filmmaking. Remember Eskapo? Remember Ligaya ang Itawag Mo sa Akin (the Reyna Films-produced flick that it distributed)? Remember this brilliant adaptation of Lualhati Bautista\\'s acclaimed novel of a single mother coming to terms with the macho culture that surrounds her? Vilma Santos is a different revelation in this film–she is both dramatic and comic, and the result is an amazing thespian coup that elevates her. And that potty mouth!\\n6. Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros\\nDirected by Auraeus Solito for Cinemalaya, 2005\\nHow did Auraeus Solito do this? The film is like beautiful magic, where everything is totally unexpected, and yet also the inevitable sum of all its elements. The magic starts, of course, with Michiko Yamamoto\\'s brilliant story of a gay boy living in the slums who must contend with a lovable (but also macho, but…) family of small-time criminals and his incipient romantic fascination for a handsome policeman. Everything is just right in this heartwarming soup of a movie–but we respect it because it does not pull punches in becoming melodramatic. It is all of subtlety, including a heartbreaking ending (a long shot reminiscent of the ending of The Third Man).\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n5. Moral\\nDirected by Marilou Diaz-Abaya for Seven Stars Productions, 1982\\nI still remember the four women in Abaya\\'s feminist drama distinctly–the tomboyish and feisty Lorna Tolentino who is lost and is searching, sometimes in the wrong places, for a thing or a cause to believe in; the garish and ambitious singer Gina Alajar who cannot seem to accept the fact that she cannot sing; the beautiful and self-assured Sandy Andolong who must deal with the fact that her husband has left her for another man; and the put-upon housewife Anna Marin who must deal with an irresponsible husband and a nagging mother-in-law in the middle of the noise of too many children, with another one on the way. This film must have been electric when it was first released, and many years later, its message about the place of women in our world is still very much relevant. Years later, Abaya directed a sequel which replace the principal cast (save for Laurice Guillen as Lorna\\'s mother). It wasn\\'t half-bad, but the original was extraordinarily searing and intelligent–and cemented Abaya\\'s place in the pantheon of local filmmakers.\\n4. Mababangong Bangungot\\n\\xa0\\nDirected by Kidlat Tahimik, 1979\\nThis is the absolute father of all independent films in the country. Eric de Guia, now known as Kidlat Tahimik, casts himself as a man in love with Westernization–but a trip to Paris would soon change him. This is a powerful, if enigmatic, film. Cruz writes of it in his blog: \"It is Tahimik\\'s generosity, his humble simplification of the world\\'s complex worries, that carries Mababangong Bangungot from its low budget imaginings. Tahimik exoticizes his culture without necessarily exploiting it. He also exoticizes European cultures; and in a way, he dons the skin of a curious documentarian, only with more humor and a drawing charm.\"\\n3. Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang\\nDirected by Lino Brocka for Cinemanila, 1974\\nTo choose just one film from Brocka is always an exercise of foolishness. Most people would choose Bona or Maynila sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag or Insiang or Kapit sa Patalim–but Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang speaks to me more for some reason. Brocka famously set about to film this in his old hometown that once ostracized him, wowing them by bringing in big stars–and then slyly makes the town as the very backdrop for his searing tale of small-town hypocrisy. Talk about the ultimate revenge. In it, the young Christopher de Leon becomes our stand-in. He plays the innocent hero who must become his own man as he struggles with the scathing drama of ordinary corruption.\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n2. Kisapmata\\nDirected by Mike de Leon for Bancom Audiovision, 1981\\nHow do you choose just one title from the filmmography of perhaps the most technically proficient–and equally poetic–of Filipino filmmakers? De Leon is like our own version of Stanley Kubrick, in that he is a strange duck of a perfectionist–but manages to make films of totally different genres and make them into gems of cinema. Consider this: he has made tearjerker drama fests (Kung Managarap Ka\\'t Magising), musicals (Kakabakaba Ka Ba?), fraternity thrillers (Batch \\'82), socialist dramas (Sister Stella L.), horror films (Itim), and postmodern biographical films (Bayaning Third World)–and did them all with the panache of a master at the top of his form. With Kisapmata–his indictment of Filipino machismo in this dark (and true life) tale of a policeman father and his murderous hold on his daughter, his wife, and his frustrated son-in-law–he orchestrates all of cinema\\'s techniques (the deliberate editing, the claustrophobic set design, the paranoid cinematography, and the subtle but gripping acting turns by Vic Silayan, Charo Santos, Charito Solis, and Jay Ilagan) to immerse us fully into the dark melodrama. We come away from the film shattered–but enriched.\\n1. Oro Plata Mata\\nDirected by Peque Gallaga for Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, 1982\\nThis is not an unconventional choice. It is almost totally expected. But every time somebody asks me what is my favorite Filipino film, I may hem and haw about the ultimate choice, but in the end this is my answer: Gallaga\\'s Negrense epic of war and loss of innocence. The Philippine Daily Inquirer\\'s Gibbs Cadiz agrees with me: \"I like how it brought a dead era back to life. The final third of the film was a mess, but everything before that was glorious. It reminds me of Visconti\\'s The Leopard–shabbier but the same spirit.\" And Rito Asilo also says: \"Oro Plata Mata eloquently vivifies the destructive reach of war and invasion. Its scope is epic, but it manages to keep its tone and temperament intimate and undeniably Pinoy. It\\'s as relevant now as it was in 1982. But it\\'s downhill from there for Gallaga, whose most recent films (2005\\'s Pinoy Blonde and 2009\\'s Agaton and Mindy) were to say atrocious.\"\\nRunners-up: Trip (directed by Juan Pula a.k.a. Jon Red for Mowelfund, 1993), Himala (directed by Ishmael Bernal for the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, 1982), and Kimi Dora (directed by Joyce Bernal for Spring Films, 2009).\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\nArt by Warren Espejo and movie posters from Video 48.\\n\\xa0\\n', 31]\n",

Along with the lumads and Christians, they now consider themselves citizens of the Philippines.�\\nIn many Muslim schools, �there is no unified curriculum. Many asatidz (teachers) are not professionally trained. Learning materials are insufficient. The quality of instruction is poor. Less than 20 percent of Muslim children are enrolled in the Madrasah. Many Muslim private schools are not recognized by the government,� Boransing said.\\nA DepEd report Boransing furnished the Philippine Daily Inquirer stated that �for years, Muslim education in the country has been dichotomized...On one hand are Muslim children in public schools and those in sectarian madaris on the other. The education received by Muslim children in public schools was not entirely sensitive to Islamic values and practices while the madaris did not follow the basic education curriculum.�\\nBoransing said the dichotomy resulted in problems like non-transferability of private madaris students to public schools and vice versa. Graduates of local Muslim schools were not competitive in the local job market because they lacked communication skills in the English language, technical skills and professional competence, he said.\\nBoransing said Madrasah �would provide Muslim children quality basic education that would be comparable with education given to non-Muslim learners.�\\nMadrasah�s basic components are Arabic language and Islamic values (Alive). The program has been adapted to the differing requirements of public schools, private madaris and Muslim out-of-school youth. Alive textbooks and teachers� manuals were developed in 2005 under a World Bank-Philippine government agreement.\\nTo ensure that asatidz have basic competencies in Arabic and Islamic studies, applicants have to pass qualifying examinations.

      "[0.00043151780327564573, 'Tweet\\nIn Filipino Librarian: The Philippines , Von Totanes asks why we refer to the country as The Philippines and not simply, Philippines.\\nAs a child, I once heard a speech of my grandfather in which he said , “The Philippines are your country and the only country God has given you,” and I asked my dad if this was simply a case of bad English. He said no, members of the older generation used the plural because in those days, the country was viewed as a collection of islands: our official name under the Americans was The Philippine Islands.\\nStarting where the revolutionaries of 1896-1898 had left off, the framers of the 1935 Constitution aimed to create a unitary state, one which emphasized the wholeness of the Philippines as a country, instead of the collection of islands referred to by the Americans. To be sure, the Americans themselves began the process of changing the reference to the Philippines from The Philippine Islands to The Philippines, specifically in the Philippine Autonomy Act or Jones Law, which served as the Organic Act or Constitution of the Philippines from 1916-1935:\\n(from the Jones Law):\\nWHEREAS it was never the intention of the people of the United States in the incipiency of the war with Spain to make it a war of conquest or for territorial aggrandizement; and\\nWHEREAS it is, as it has always been, the purpose of the people of the United States to withdraw their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize their independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein; and\\nWHEREAS for the speedy accomplishment of such purpose it is desirable to place in the hands of the people of the Philippines as large a control of their domestic affairs as can be given them without, in the meantime, impairing the exercise of the rights of sovereignty by the people of the United States, in order that, by the use and exercise of popular franchise and governmental powers, they may be the better prepared to fully assume the responsibilities and enjoy all the privileges of complete independence: Therefore\\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the provisions of this Act and the name “The Philippines” as used in this Act shall apply to and include the Philippine Islands ceded to the United States Government by the treaty of peace concluded between the United States and Spain on the eleventh day of April, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, the boundaries of which are set forth in Article III of said treaty, together with those islands embraced in the treaty between Spain and the United States concluded at Washington on the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred.\\nThus, what was used for convenience by the Americans was, for the framers of the 1935 charter, a conscious adoption of a new name, with very definite ideas about what the new reference implied:\\nARTICLE XVIII The Commonwealth and the Republic\\nSection. 1. The government established by this Constitution shall be known as the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Upon the final and complete withdrawal of the sovereignty of the United States and the proclamation of Philippine independence, the Commonwealth of the Philippines shall thenceforth be known as the Republic of the Philippines.\\nIn a sense, this was a reversion to “La Republica Filipina” although because of the change in dominant official languages from Spanish to English, the sense is still different. Under the First Republic, we were “The Philippine Republic,” which is more in keeping with the sense of the Malolos Constitution that the Philippines comprised the political union of The Filipinos:\\nTHE REPUBLIC\\nArticle 1. The political association of all Filipinos constitutes a nation, whose state shall be known as the Philippine Republic.\\nThis is an important distinction first pointed out to me by a French historian. According to him, you have to contrast the Malolos definition of the Philippines with that contained in the 1935 and subsequent Constitutions:\\n1935 Constitution: ARTICLE I The National Territory\\nSection 1. The Philippines comprises all the territory ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris concluded between the United States and Spain on the tenth day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, the limits which are set forth in Article III of said treaty, together with all the islands embraced in the treaty concluded at Washington between the United States and Spain on the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred, and the treaty concluded between the United States and Great Britain on the second day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty, and all territory over which the present Government of the Philippine Islands exercises jurisdiction.\\n1973 Constitution: ARTICLE I The National Territory\\nSection 1. The national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all the other territories belonging to the Philippines by historic or legal title, including the territorial sea, the air space, the subsoil, the sea-bed, the insular shelves, and the submarine areas over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, irrespective of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.\\nThe present Constitution:\\nARTICLE I\\nNATIONAL TERRITORY\\nThe national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial and aerial domains, including its territorial sea, the seabed, the subsoil, the insular shelves, and other submarine areas. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.\\nAll of the above, 1935 to the present, according to the French historian, are profoundly Anglo-Saxon definitions of nationhood, defining a country according to boundaries and soil. The Malolos Constitution, on the other hand, basically defines national identity and nationhood by blood, which he says is very German and even very French. So it was that, for example, one of the first reforms prior to the extreme phase of the French revolution was to change Louis XVI’s title to King of the French from King of France. The former was leader of a collective union, the latter, sovereign of a personally-owned fiefdom. This is why, also, Louis-Philippe was named King of the French, and Napoleon III, Emperor of the French; to this day, the sovereign of Belgium is King of the Belgians.\\nSo when the framers of the 1935 Constitution in a sense, named their country, a chance Filipinos hadn’t had since 1898, they decided to view their country in the singular and not the plural: my guess is that an attempt would have been made to drop “The” even later on. In 1940, the Coat of Arms of the Commonwealth was briefly changed, the scroll underneath, for one, which had said “Commonwealth of the Philippines,” changed to simply, “Philippines.” Unfortunately the design (very similar to today’s national coat of arms) was unpopular at the time, and the old Commonwealth arms swiftly restored.\\nYou may wonder why, in Constitutional Conventions, there are Committees on Style. Lawyers who require precision of language know the importance of style, and the ability of the framers of Constitutions to be arbiters of proper (or authorized) usage is clearly shown in the decision to refer to the Philippines in the singular instead of the old plural:\\n1935 Constitution:\\nARTICLE II Declaration of Principles\\nSection 1. The Philippines, is a republican state. Sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.\\nAnyway, that is why we say “The Philippines is…” and not, “The Philippines are…”, the continuation of “the” simply being to keep the language mellifluous: simply “Philippines” would be too abrupt in spoken and written English.\\n', 41]\n",

SWITCH NOW to the new, more interactive format.\\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributed to the generally free practice of religion.\\nThe government generally respected religious freedom in practice. There was no change in the status of respect for religious freedom by the government during the reporting period. The armed insurgent Muslim group Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) continued to seek greater autonomy. The government and MILF have successfully maintained a ceasefire instituted in July 2009 and have since engaged in peace talks. There was some ethnic, religious, and cultural discrimination against members of the Muslim minority by members of the Christian majority. This, combined with economic disparities, contributed to persistent conflict in certain provinces in the southern part of the country.\\nThe U.S. government discusses religious freedom with the government as part of its overall policy to promote human rights. The embassy actively encouraged the peace process between the government and MILF and maintained active outreach with religious leaders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to engage them in interfaith activities.\\nSection I. Religious Demography\\nThe country has an area of 115,831 square miles and a population of 97.98 million.\\nAccording to the National Statistics Office, approximately 93 percent of the population is Christian. Roman Catholics, the largest religious group, constitute 80 to 85 percent of the total population.\\nIslam is the largest minority religion, and Muslims constitute between 5 and 9 percent of the total population. Most Filipino Muslims are members of various ethnic minority groups. They reside principally on Mindanao and nearby islands. Although most belong to the Sunni branch of Islam, a small number of Shi\\'a Muslims live in the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Zamboanga del Sur in Mindanao. An increasing number of Filipino Muslims have migrated to the urban centers of Manila and Cebu.\\nGroups that together constitute less than 5 percent of the population include Seventh-day Adventists, United Church of Christ, United Methodist, the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, Assemblies of God, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Philippine (Southern) Baptists. Domestically established denominations include the Philippine Independent Church (Aglipayan); the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ); the Members Church of God International; and The Kingdom of Jesus Christ, the Name Above Every Name. Iglesia ni Cristo is the largest indigenous Christian denomination, with approximately 5.6 million members. Christianity is the majority religion among indigenous peoples. Between 12 million and 16 million indigenous persons adhere to Catholicism or Protestantism, often incorporating elements of traditional indigenous belief systems.\\nConversion from Christianity to Islam is most typical among overseas Filipinos while they are living and working in Islamic countries. Many of these converts remain Muslim upon their return to the country and are known collectively as \"Balik Islam\" (return to Islam).\\nSection II. Status of Government Respect for Religious Freedom\\nLegal/Policy Framework\\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributed to the generally free practice of religion. There is no state religion, and the constitution provides for the separation of church and state.\\nThe law required organized religions to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Bureau of Internal Revenue to establish tax-exempt status. There was no penalty for failing to register, and some groups do not. There were no reports of discrimination in the registration system during the reporting period.\\nOn February 18, 2010, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Republic Act 9997, which replaced the Office of Muslim Affairs with the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF). The cabinet-level commission worked to promote the rights of Muslim Filipinos at both the national and local level and supported the implementation of economic, educational, cultural, and infrastructure programs for Muslim Filipino communities. NCMF’s Bureau of Pilgrimage and Endowment will administer the Hajj (annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca). It is also responsible for the administration of awqaf (endowment properties) and institutions and the conduct of activities for the establishment and maintenance of Haji towns, Islamic centers, and other projects. The Presidential Assistant for Muslim Affairs helps coordinate relations with countries that have large Islamic populations and that contributed to Mindanao\\'s economic development and the peace process.\\nThe government permitted religious instruction in public schools with parents’ written consent, provided there was no cost to the government. Based on a traditional policy of promoting moral education, local public schools gave religious groups the opportunity to teach moral values during school hours. Attendance was not mandatory, and the various groups shared classroom space. The government also allowed interested groups to distribute religious literature in public schools. By law public schools must ensure that the religious rights of students are protected. Muslim students are allowed to wear hijab (head coverings), and Muslim girls are not required to wear shorts during physical education classes. In many parts of Mindanao, Muslim students routinely attended Catholic schools from elementary to university level; these students were not required to receive religious instruction.\\nApproximately 14 percent of the Mindanao student population attended madaris (Islamic schools). Government officials estimated there were more than 1,000 madaris operating throughout the country. Of these more than half were located in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). A total of 588 madaris were registered with the NCMF, while 40 were registered with the Department of Education (DepEd). Registration with the NCMF or the DepEd is optional for madaris but, if pursued, can lead to financial assistance from the government. Most madaris did not meet the department\\'s accreditation standards. The DepEd manages financial assistance to the madaris system from local and international sources, and the DepEd\\'s Bureau of Madrasah Education oversees education activities in the ARMM.\\nThe government continued to implement its unified curriculum, designed to integrate madaris into the national education system. In addition to the 40 madaris registered with the DepEd, five madaris in Mindanao were in the process of obtaining operation permits from DepEd at the end of the reporting period. DepEd ordered public elementary schools that had at least 15 Muslim students to begin offering Arabic language instruction and classes on Islamic values, but funding shortfalls and a lack of qualified Arabic teachers limited the reach of this initiative. During the 2009-10 school year, DepEd provided Arabic language instruction and Islamic values education, including textbooks on these subjects, to Muslim students in selected public elementary schools. In August 2009, DepEd began an assistance program with seed funding of $398,992 (Philippine Peso 19 million) to private madaris that have already adopted the standard curriculum on madrasah.\\nThe government\\'s National Ecumenical Consultative Committee (NECCOM) fostered interfaith dialogue among major religious groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, Muslim groups, Iglesia ni Cristo, Aglipayan, and Protestant denominations. Smaller Protestant denominations are represented in the NECCOM through the National Council of Churches of the Philippines and the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, two large networks of Protestant churches and mission groups. NECCOM members met periodically with the President to discuss social and political issues.\\nThe government observes the following religious holidays as national holidays: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter, All Saints\\' Day, Christmas Day, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha.\\nRestrictions on Religious Freedom\\nThe government generally respected religious freedom in practice. There was no change in the status of respect for religious freedom by the government during the reporting period. There were no reports of religious detainees or prisoners in the country. The government does not ban or discourage specific religious groups or religious factions. However, Muslims, who are concentrated in some of the most impoverished provinces, complained that the government had not made sufficient efforts to promote their economic development. Some Muslim religious leaders asserted that Muslims suffered from economic discrimination. The government\\'s campaign against terrorist groups led some human rights NGOs to accuse the police and military of acting with bias in their treatment of Muslims.\\nThe Code of Muslim Personal Laws recognizes Shari\\'a (Islamic law) as part of national law; however, it does not apply in criminal matters, and it applies only to Muslims. Some ulama (Muslim community leaders) argued that the government should allow Islamic courts to extend their jurisdiction to criminal law cases, and some supported the MILF\\'s goal of forming an autonomous region governed in accordance with Islamic law. As in other parts of the judicial system, the Shari\\'a courts suffered from a large number of unfilled positions. All five Shari\\'a district court judgeships and 39 percent of circuit court judgeships remained vacant. Aside from budget restrictions, judicial positions on the Shari\\'a courts were particularly difficult to fill because applicants must be members of both the Shari\\'a bar and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.\\nForced Religious Conversions\\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion.\\nAbuses by Rebel or Foreign Forces or Terrorist Organizations\\nThe government attributed several attacks in the first half of 2009 to MILF separatist rebels who continued to seek political autonomy in Mindanao during the reporting period. In August 2008 after the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on the signing of a government-MILF territorial agreement, an agreement later declared unconstitutional, MILF attacks and subsequent clashes with government troops resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Christian and Muslim residents and the internal displacement in central Mindanao of hundreds of thousands of civilians. The government and MILF instituted a ceasefire in July 2009 and have since engaged in peace talks.\\nDuring the reporting period, the government also attributed a series of attacks, kidnappings, and killings to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), other Islamic militants, and the New People\\'s Army. Religious affiliation was not seen as a relevant factor in these attacks.\\nSporadic bombings of places of worship also occurred during the reporting period. On July 5, 2009, a bomb outside the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Cotabato City killed six and wounded 30 others as they were leaving worship service. On July 7 two more bombs exploded near a cathedral in Jolo City, killing two people and injuring 50. On January 11, 2010, a grenade exploded outside a cathedral in Jolo, Sulu. There were no reported injuries, but the cathedral was slightly damaged. On May 9, 2010, the day prior to national elections, two persons were killed and 12 wounded when a hand grenade was thrown inside a mosque in Pikit, North Cotabato. The Philippine National Police detained suspects affiliated with the ASG in connection with these bombings.\\nImprovements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom\\nMany Muslims welcomed the enactment of the Republic Act 9997, which created and funded the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF). The new commission will expand activities supporting Islamic religious practices and promote the implementation of economic, educational, cultural, and infrastructure programs for Muslim Filipino communities. The new law also mandated the commission\\'s engagement in the following activities: peace process, development of domestic trade and commerce among the members of Muslim Filipino communities, promotion of the halal (a food preparation method in Islamic dietary law), and undertaking studies and establishing ethnographic research centers and museums on Muslim cultures and institutions.\\nThe government promoted interfaith dialogue to build mutual trust and respect among various religious and cultural groups. The Council on Interfaith Initiatives continued to strengthen the government\\'s existing institutional arrangements for interfaith activities by coordinating interfaith programs and initiatives with all government agencies, local government units, and NGO partners. The council receives, approves, and prioritizes programs and project proposals designed to achieve peace and development through interfaith dialogue and cooperation.\\nFrom March 16 to 18, 2010, the country hosted the Special Non-aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development (SNAMMM). During the meeting the 118 member representatives of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) adopted a declaration that called for respect of cultural and religious diversity, promotion of tolerance and interfaith dialogues, and related confidence-building measures among members. The government\\'s Council on Values Formation also spearheaded a parallel meeting on interfaith dialogue on March 16, 2010. During the meeting 70 delegates from various civil society and religious organizations urged the NAM member countries to collaborate in resolving issues that would promote lasting peace and development.\\nSection III. Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom\\nHistorically, Muslims have been alienated socially from the Christian majority, and some ethnic and cultural discrimination against Muslims have been recorded. Young Muslim professionals reported that some employers stereotyped Muslims as being less educated. Some Muslims reported that they had difficulty renting rooms in boarding houses or being hired for retail work if they used their real names or wore distinctive Muslim dress. Therefore, many resorted to adopting Christian pseudonyms and wearing Western clothing.\\nOver the past 60 years, efforts by the dominant Christian population to resettle in traditionally Muslim areas such as Mindanao have fostered resentment among many Muslim residents. Many Muslims viewed Christian proselytizing as another form of resettlement, with the intention of depriving Muslims of their homeland and cultural identity, including their religion.\\nDespite these circumstances, amicable ties among religious communities were common, and many participated in interdenominational efforts to alleviate poverty. The Peacemakers\\' Circle Foundation, a loose coalition of various religious and faith-based groups, continued to focus on building and strengthening interfaith relations through dialogues between Muslims and Christians in selected communities. The Bishops-Ulama Conference in Mindanao continued to bring together Catholic bishops and members of the Ulama League of the Philippines from Mindanao and hold dialogues on addressing local issues of peace and order and intercultural solidarity. Other interfaith groups also promoted peace between persons of different faiths. Leadership of human rights groups, trade union confederations, and industry associations typically represents many religious persuasions.\\nSection IV. U.S. Government Policy\\nThe U.S. government discusses religious freedom with the government as part of its overall policy to promote human rights. U.S. embassy officers regularly met with representatives of all major religious groups to discuss these problems and concerns. In addition the U.S. government actively supported the government\\'s peace process with Muslim insurgents in Mindanao, which has the potential to contribute to peace and a better climate for interfaith cooperation.\\nThe embassy also maintained active outreach with NGOs. The embassy hosted meetings of political and opinion leaders from the Muslim community to discuss the U.S. role in Mindanao. The embassy continued to conduct a wide range of programming to promote interfaith dialogue and peace and to highlight these issues with populations in and around Manila, as well as across Mindanao. In December 2009 the embassy coordinated the visit to the country of the U.S. Special Representative to Muslim Communities, Farah Pandith. The visit included mission briefings, a forum with university students, meetings with NGOs working on Muslim and peace-related issues, interviews with the traditional and Web-based media, meetings with religious leaders and women leaders, and a visit to a local Muslim community to meet government and community leaders.\\nIn February 2009 American Imam Talal Y. Eid, a member of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, visited the country to promote interfaith dialogue and cooperation among interethnic audiences, including women’s groups and youth in Metro Manila and Mindanao.\\nThe estimated total development support of the U.S. government to Mindanao for fiscal year 2009 is $69 million, which composes nearly 60 percent of U.S. government development assistance to the Philippines. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs contributed to promoting peace and fostering an environment for greater religious tolerance. USAID trained more than 470 peace advocates, mostly Muslims from areas in Mindanao affected by conflict and Muslim separatist activities. Almost 30 percent of the trained peace advocates were Muslim women. USAID funds were also used to develop an Islamic-based handbook on conflict resolution for community leaders and to institutionalize community-level alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In the environment sector, USAID supported a special initiative called Al Khalifa (The Steward), an environmental sourcebook based on the Islamic perspective on managing the environment.\\nUSAID programs also provided support to former MILF combatants to encourage their shift from fighting to productive farming and supported the construction of community-based infrastructure projects. With U.S. Department of Defense 1207 funding, USAID completed the Tawi Tawi airport runway improvement project in FY 2009, which will facilitate increased passenger and cargo traffic, thereby supporting economic development in the conflict-affected areas in the Sulu Archipelago. Improvements in transportation infrastructure in the conflict-affected areas are expected to support long-term economic progress and help consolidate peace.\\nUSAID also supported several internship programs for Muslim students. Fourteen Muslim students completed intensive hands-on training in business administration and enterprise development with multi-national companies. Twenty-five young Muslim student leaders were sponsored as interns of the largely Christian-dominated Philippine House of Representatives. The legislative internship program helped policymakers develop a more intimate understanding of Mindanao\\'s Muslim cultures, while simultaneously fostering an appreciation among the interns for the policy-making and legislative processes.\\nIn May and June of 2009, USAID and the embassy\\'s public affairs section coorganized the Cultures Across Mindanao program, which included the participation of more than 200 in- and out-of-school youth from different faiths and ethnic roots across Mindanao. The youth were given training as peace advocates in five-day camps and were provided an interfaith environment where they could interact with one another. USAID assisted 21 madaris last year to adopt the Department of Education’s Standard Madrasah Curriculum and get accreditation and support from the national government. The owners and administrators of the selected madaris were given capacity-building training, such as planning, financial management, school governance, and resource mobilization.\\nWith increased staffing for expanded outreach in Mindanao, the Embassy′s Public Affairs Section funded programs in Mindanao that included high school education, arts preservation, community policing, and a summer youth camp. The Embassy partnered with a local NGO to implement a two-year English Microscholarship Program that initially provided after-school English instruction for three public high schools in July 2009 and expanded to some public high schools in Mindanao in September 2009.\\nIn March 2010 the Embassy partnered with a local university in Jolo to launch a revitalization program for Sulu arts and culture. This activity was designed to allow the inhabitants to engage in productive cultural activities that preserve and protect the indigenous culture. The Embassy also partnered with the National Arts Center to sponsor a 12-day summer camp of creative interaction in modern-urban dance for 50 young dancers from the Sulu Archipelago and Luzon. The participants utilized dance as an art form to foster dialogue about art and other forms of human interaction as tools in conflict resolution, leadership skills building, and building bridges across and within cultures, including both Philippine-U.S. and internal Philippine dialogues.\\nIn This Section:\\n', 210]\n",

      "[0.00031069281835846487, \"Christianisierung[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nAls die Spanier 1565 die Philippinen als ihre Kolonie beanspruchten und es somit Neuspanien angliederten, war der Islam noch nicht tief verwurzelt, so dass es ihnen nicht schwerfiel, auch die muslimische Bevölkerung zum Christentum zu bekehren. Außerdem wurde die Christianisierung der Philippinen weitgehend friedlich durchgeführt, unter anderem wurden animistische Praktiken weitgehend geduldet, von denen einige bis heute überlebt haben. Der Buddhismus, der vermutlich neben dem Islam im 16. Jahrhundert die vorherrschende Religion auf den Philippinen war, wurde bald nur noch von der chinesischen Minderheit praktiziert.\\nAngesichts ihrer Niederlage gegen die Spanier im Jahr 1571 konvertierten die Rajahs von Manila, Rajah Sulayman , Rajah Lakandula und Rajah Matanda zum Katholizismus. Dafür durften sie einige Privilegien behalten und wurden ins koloniale Herrschaftssystem integriert. Durch die weitgehende Einbindung der einheimischen Häuptlinge in das koloniale Herrschaftssystem entstand die soziale Schicht der principialia, die als Mittelsmänner und Nutznießer des Kolonialsystems jenes über Jahrhunderte festigten.\\nDer andere wichtige Machtfaktor in der philippinischen Kolonie waren spanische Mönche und Priester. Aufgrund ihrer Rolle in der Missionierung und in den späteren Gemeinden waren sie oft die einzigen Spanier, die eine einheimische Sprache sprechen konnten. Sie lebten im Gegensatz zu den Kolonialbeamten, die nur auf Zeit im Lande waren, mehrere Jahrzehnte im Land. Sie wurden als Vermittler unverzichtbar und somit sehr mächtig.\\nIm Süden der Philippinen war der Islam zum Zeitpunkt der Ankunft der Spanier bereits tiefer verwurzelt, so dass die dortigen Moslems, von den Spaniern Moros genannt, nicht das Christentum annahmen.\\nKoloniale Wirtschaft[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nIn der frühen Kolonialzeit bildete der Galeonenhandel zwischen Manila und Acapulco die wichtigste Einnahmequelle für die Kolonie. Silber aus den Minen der neuen Welt wurde von Acapulco nach Manila verschifft und dort benutzt, um chinesische Waren wie Seide und Porzellan zu kaufen. Da bis zum 18. Jahrhundert nur die Portugiesen mit Macao das Recht hatten, die chinesische Küste direkt anzusteuern, war man auf chinesische Händler angewiesen, die sich in einem eigenen Viertel vor Manila ansiedelten, dem heutigen Binondo, wo sich auch heute die Chinatown von Manila befindet.\\nIm frühen 19. Jahrhundert änderte sich die wirtschaftliche und politische Situation. Mexiko wurde unabhängig, so dass die Philippinen nicht mehr zu Neuspanien gehörten, sondern zum ersten Mal direkt von Spanien aus verwaltet wurden. Der Galeonenhandel nach Acapulco war nicht mehr möglich und wurde 1815 eingestellt. Die Philippinen wurden nach und nach dem Welthandel geöffnet, so dass für Teile der einheimischen principalia sowie Mestizen sowohl spanischer als auch chinesischer Herkunft Wohlstand ermöglicht wurde, so dass einige ihren Kindern ein Studium, oftmals sogar in Europa, finanzieren konnten. Es entstand die Schicht der ilustrados, die durch neue, freiheitliche Ideen aus Europa beeinflusst wurden.\\nReformen und Revolution[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nJosé Rizal, Nationalheld\\nDie erste große Zäsur in der spanischen Kolonialherrschaft auf den Philippinen war die britische Invasion im Jahr 1762 , die bis 1764 andauern sollte. In deren Folge entwickelten sich Aufstände in der Ilocos-Region und Pangasinan. Diego Silang führte einen Aufstand an und es gelang ihm 1763 die bedeutende Stadt Vigan einzunehmen. Er verbündete sich mit den Briten, doch hielten sich diese nicht an ihre Zusagen, so dass er am 28. Mai 1763 ermordet wurde. Seine Frau Gabriela führte den Aufstand fort, wurde jedoch im September verhaftet und ermordet, was als Hinrichtung dargestellt wurde. Im Jahr 1762 brach in der Provinz Pangasinán der Palaris-Aufstand aus, der zunächst ebenfalls erfolgreich war und erst 1765 niedergeschlagen werden konnte. [48] In der Folge dieser Ereignisse wurde vielen Filipinos klar, dass die spanische Oberhoheit nicht ewig dauern könne.\\nVon besonderer Bedeutung für die Philippinen war die Säkularisierungsbewegung innerhalb der katholischen Kirche, die von Pedro Pelaez in den 1850er Jahren begründet wurde. Die Bewegung forderte die Philippinisierung der Kirche und eine Beschränkung der Macht der spanischen Ordensgemeinschaften. Die Bewegung war von liberalen Ideen geprägt, die die Gleichberechtigung von Filipinos und Spaniern forderte. [49]\\n1868 fand in Spanien eine Revolution statt, so dass der liberale Gouverneur Carlos Maria dela Torre auf die Philippinen geschickt wurde, der liberale Reformen durchführte und unter anderem die Pressezensur abschaffte. 1871 war diese Phase jedoch vorbei. Insbesondere die spanischen Mönchsorden auf den Philippinen entfalteten wieder ihre Macht. Am 20. Januar 1872 brach im Fort San Felipe die Cavite-Meuterei aus, die jedoch schnell niedergeschlagen wurde. In der Folge der Meuterei wurden jedoch die Priester Mariano Gómez, José Burgos und Jacinto Zamora inhaftiert. Die spanischen Kolonialbehörden nutzten das Ereignis, um sich unliebsamer Zeitgenossen, die für ihre fortschrittlichen Ideen bekannt waren, zu entledigen. Drei Priester wurden am 17. Februar 1872 hingerichtet, was einen Aufschrei des Entsetzens in der Bevölkerung auslöste und zur Bewegung der Ilustrados führte. Die drei Priester sind bis heute als GOMBURZA ein Begriff im Gedächtnis der Filipinos.\\nIm letzten Viertel des 19. Jahrhunderts wurden die Rufe der Ilustrados nach Reformen immer lauter. Die Bezeichnung Filipino, die früher nur für spanische Kreolen benutzt wurde, wurde auf alle Einwohner des Landes ausgeweitet. Die Propagandabewegung, die aus Europa von philippinischen Studenten und Exilanten betrieben wurde, sowie die kurzlebige La Liga Filipina , die kurz nach ihrer Gründung durch José Rizal in Manila sofort von den dortigen Behörden verboten wurde, hatten zunächst nicht die Unabhängigkeit der Philippinen zum Ziel, sondern Gleichberechtigung der Filipinos und philippinische Sitze in den spanischen Cortes . Doch für einige ging dies nicht weit genug.\\nVon 1896 bis 1898 fand unter der Führung des Katipunan die Philippinische Revolution statt, die in ihrer Endphase praktisch in den Spanisch-Amerikanischen Krieg überging. Im Verlauf der Revolution wurde im Juli 1897 die erste provisorische Republik ausgerufen, die Republik von Biak-na-Bato , und am 1. November die erste provisorische Verfassung der Philippinen verabschiedet, die am 15. November in Kraft trat. Die Republik wurde jedoch am 15. Dezember 1897 wieder aufgelöst mit der Unterzeichnung des Vertrages von Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel zwischen der philippinischen und der spanischen Partei. [50]\\nBereits zu Beginn dieser Auseinandersetzung zwischen Spanien und den Vereinigten Staaten wurde die spanische Flotte durch amerikanische Schiffe in der Schlacht in der Bucht von Manila vernichtet. Ein Großteil des Landes war jedoch zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits unter philippinischer Kontrolle, worauf am 12. Juni 1898 die philippinische Unabhängigkeitserklärung erfolgte, welche weder von der alten noch der neuen Kolonialmacht anerkannt und vom Rest der Welt gar nicht erst wahrgenommen wurde. 1899 folgte die Konstitution der ersten philippinischen Republik .\\nAmerikanische Kolonialzeit[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nDie USA erkannten die junge philippinische Republik nicht an und bekämpften sie im Philippinisch-Amerikanischen Krieg von 1899 bis 1902 massiv. Etwa eine Million Filipinos (20\\xa0% der Gesamtbevölkerung) kamen während dieser Zeit ums Leben, und das Land wurde zur amerikanischen Kolonie. [51] Unterstützung erhielten die Revolutionäre lediglich vom Hongkong-Komitee , das internationale Verbindungen knüpfte und für die materielle Unterstützung der Filipinos sorgte. [52]\\nBereits am 20. Januar 1900 wurde die Schurman-Kommission von US-Präsident William McKinley berufen. Sie sollte Vorschläge für einen Übergang zu einer zivilen Kolonialverwaltung ausarbeiten, diese Ergebnisse wurden im Januar 1901 vorgelegt. [53] Im März 1901 wurde daraufhin der spätere US-Präsident William Howard Taft zum Vorsitzenden der nach ihm benannten Taft-Kommission berufen und auf die Philippinen entsandt, um eine zivile Kolonialverwaltung zu etablieren. Er baute den Obersten Gerichtshof der Philippinen auf, zu dessen erstem Vorsitzenden Cayetano Arellano 1901 berufen wurde, und es wurde ein öffentliches Bildungswesen etabliert. [54] Es wurden auch Vorbereitungen getroffen, um eine Zweikammer-Legislative zu schaffen. Die Taft-Kommission bildete nach Vorbild des US-Systems das Oberhaus und die Philippinische Versammlung das Unterhaus, erste Wahlen zu Letzterer wurden am 30. Juni 1907 durchgeführt und am 16. Oktober Manila Grand Opera House konstituiert. [55]\\n1904 wurde im Süden der Philippinen, der von den Spaniern nie ganz unterworfen worden war, von den Amerikanern die Moro Province gegründet und militärisch kontrolliert. Dadurch kam es zum Moro-Amerikanischen Krieg , der von 1904 bis 1913/16 andauerte und durch den US-General John Pershing beendet wurde. So wurde aus der in spanischer Zeit eher formellen Zugehörigkeit der Moslemgebiete zu den Philippinen eine faktische. Auf der Insel Mindanao wurden große Monokulturen amerikanischer Konzerne angelegt, wie zum Beispiel Ananasplantagen. Es kam in den 1920er und 1950er Jahren außerdem zu staatlich geförderten Siedlungsprogrammen, bei denen Christen aus dem Norden und aus der Mitte der Philippinen in den Süden gebracht wurden. Der heutige Konflikt im Süden der Philippinen hat seine Wurzeln in dieser Zeit.\\nMit Inkrafttreten des Philippine Autonomy Acts 1916 wurde den Filipinos mehr Aufgaben übertragen, dazu löste die Philippinische Legislative das bisherige Parlamentssystem ab, so dass man ab diesem Zeitpunkt von einem halbautonomen Status der Philippinen sprechen kann. In diesem Zweikammersystem waren nunmehr nur noch Filipinos vertreten. [56]\\n1935 wurde eine Teilautonomie für die Philippinen mit dem Ziel der Unabhängigkeit bis 1945 beschlossen. Kurz darauf wurde die Einwanderung von Filipinos in die USA erheblich eingeschränkt. Manuel Quezon wurde Präsident des Commonwealth der Philippinen . Das Parlament wurde auf ein Einkammersystem reduziert, die Nationalversammlung. 1940 verständigte man sich wieder auf ein Zweikammersystem und der Commonwealth Kongress entstand. 1937 wurde das Frauenwahlrecht durchgesetzt und von diesem Zeitpunkt an konnten sich Frauen auch für politische Ämter bewerben. [57] Quezon holte sich später Douglas MacArthur als Militärberater hinzu, der beim Aufbau eigener philippinischer Streitkräfte half. 1941/42 kämpften philippinische und amerikanische Soldaten vergeblich gegen die eindringende japanische Armee (→ Schlacht um die Philippinen ). Am 8. Mai 1942 kapitulierten die letzten philippinischen und amerikanischen Einheiten.\\nVon 1942 bis 1945 wurden die Philippinen im Zuge des Zweiten Weltkriegs von Japan besetzt. Etwa 1 Million Filipinos starben durch das brutale Besatzungsregime der japanischen Armee, etliche Städte wurden in Schutt und Asche gelegt.\\nAm 4. Juli 1946 wurden die Philippinen offiziell in die Unabhängigkeit entlassen. Die USA behielten einige Jahrzehnte lang wirtschaftliche Sonderrechte und militärische Stützpunkte auf den Philippinen und spielen bis heute eine wichtige Rolle in der philippinischen Politik.\\nMediendatei abspielen\\nFilmaufnahmen der Unabhängigkeitserklärung (englisch)\\nNach der Unabhängigkeit galt zunächst einmal die Verfassung von 1935 weiter, in der die Philippinen eine Präsidialrepublik nach amerikanischem Muster waren. Der Einfluss der USA blieb weiterhin sehr groß, unter anderem ließen sich die USA am 14. März 1947 für die Dauer von 99 Jahren die Hoheitsrechte über 23 Militärstützpunkte garantieren. Die Philippinen entsandten wiederum 1951 fünf Bataillone in den Koreakrieg , um den USA zu helfen.\\nGegen Aufstände durch die kommunistischen Hukbalahap , einer ehemaligen Widerstandsbewegung gegen die japanische Besatzung, gab es von den USA Ausrüstung und amerikanische Militärberater, unter anderem der CIA-Agent Edward Lansdale , der später in Vietnam eine wichtige Rolle spielen sollte. Um den Aufstand zu entschärfen, wurde in den 1950er Jahren die Umsiedlung armer Bauern in den Süden der Philippinen verstärkt gefördert.\\nIm Jahr 1963 kam es zu einem Konflikt mit Malaysia , da die Philippinen Sabah als früheren Bestandteil des Sultanats von Sulu beanspruchten. Diese Problematik ist bis heute offen. So verordnete die philippinische Präsidentin Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, dass Sabah nicht als Teil Malaysias anerkannt wird, 2013 erinnerte das philippinische Außenministerium an die Verordnung. [58]\\nAufgrund von Konflikten zwischen christlichen Siedlern und muslimischen Einheimischen kam es in den 1960er Jahren immer mehr zu Konflikten im Süden der Philippinen. 1968 wurden einige muslimische Armee-Rekruten erschossen, die sich weigerten, an einer Geheimoperation zur Rückeroberung Sabahs teilzunehmen. Als Reaktion auf dieses Massaker bildeten sich die ersten separatistischen Bewegungen auf den Südphilippinen.\\nIm Jahr 1965 wurde der populäre junge Politiker Ferdinand E. Marcos zum Präsidenten gewählt. 1971 wurde Marcos als erster Präsident der Philippinen wiedergewählt, wobei die Wahl als solche sehr umstritten war. Im selben Jahr ließ Marcos eine verfassungsgebende Versammlung einberufen, um die veraltete Verfassung von 1935 zu ersetzen. Gegner von Marcos verdächtigten ihn deshalb des Versuches, die Beschränkung auf zwei Wahlperioden umgehen zu wollen. Ab 1970 hatte es Marcos außerdem sowohl mit dem First Quarter Storm zu tun, einer linken Studentenbewegung, die unter anderem seine Amtsführung, den pro-amerikanischen Kurs geißelte, als auch mit einer neuen maoistischen kommunistischen Guerilla, der New People's Army (NPA) und der Alex Boncayao-Brigade (ABB).\\nMarcos-Diktatur[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nFerdinand Marcos\\nIm Jahr 1972 gab es eine Serie von Bombenanschlägen, von denen man heute vermutet, dass sie von Militärs durchgeführt wurden, um Marcos einen Vorwand für das Kriegsrecht zu liefern. Am 21. September 1972 erklärte Marcos das Kriegsrecht, ließ Oppositionszeitungen und -sender schließen und veranlasste die Inhaftierung zahlreicher Oppositioneller. 1973 ließ er eine neue parlamentarische Verfassung ratifizieren. Das Kriegsrecht wurde zwar 1980 aufgehoben und es kam 1981 sogar zu einer Parlamentswahl, bei der aber massive Wahlfälschung vermutet wurde.\\nWährend der Marcos-Diktatur kam es zu massiven Repressalien gegen Oppositionelle. Manche wurden jahrelang in Untersuchungshaft gehalten, unter anderem der prominente Marcos-Rivale Benigno Aquino, Jr. Im Zuge der Bekämpfung der NPA kam es in manchen Provinzen zu Repressalien gegen die Landbevölkerung. Etliche Oppositionelle oder vermutete Kommunisten verschwanden entweder spurlos oder wurden schwer verstümmelt aufgefunden, eine Praxis, die vom Militär „salvaging“ genannt wurde. Unterdessen bereicherten sich Marcos, seine Frau Imelda und seine Freunde, während die Auslandsschulden der Philippinen immer weiter stiegen. Es wurde viel Geld für Prestigeprojekte ausgegeben, unter anderem für eine Herzklinik und einen Filmpalast.\\nCorazon Aquino (1992)\\nAm 21. August 1983 wurde der Oppositionsführer Benigno Aquino bei dem Versuch, das Land am Flughafen von Manila zu betreten, ermordet. Daraufhin entwickelte sich eine breite Oppositionsbewegung gegen Marcos, der dieser mit vorgezogenen Neuwahlen zu begegnen versuchte. Nach der gefälschten vorgezogenen Präsidentschaftswahl vom Februar 1986 demonstrierten mehr als eine Million Filipinos auf der EDSA-Avenue in Manila und forderten Marcos Rücktritt. Die katholische Kirche unterstützte die Demonstranten, woraufhin die Demonstrationen sich über das gesamte Land ausweiteten und als EDSA-Revolution in die Geschichte eingingen. Durch die Weigerung des Militärs, die Demonstration gewaltsam aufzulösen, sah sich Marcos am 25. Februar 1986 gezwungen, in das US-amerikanische Hawaii zu fliehen. Die Witwe des ermordeten Benigno Aquino und Oppositionsführerin, Corazon Aquino , wurde am selben Tag als die neue Präsidentin vereidigt. [59]\\nPolitik[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nAm 11. Februar 1987 trat eine neue Verfassung in Kraft und seit 1987 sind die Philippinen wieder eine Präsidialrepublik . Der Präsident hat weitreichende exekutive Befugnisse. Er beruft das Kabinett ein. Der Kongress besteht aus Repräsentantenhaus und Senat . Es besteht de jure Wahlpflicht .\\nVom 20. Januar 2001 bis zum 30. Juni 2010 war Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (*\\xa01947) Staatsoberhaupt (zuvor Vizepräsidentin); sie wurde am 30. Juni 2004 trotz verschiedener Vorwürfe massiver Wahlfälschungen, die in der Folgezeit noch bestätigt wurden (Tonbandmitschnitt der Fälschungsvereinbarungen, im weiteren Verlauf auch präzise Aussagen von reuigen Mitgliedern der Wahlkommission) erneut vereidigt. Am 18. November 2011 wurde gegen sie ein Haftbefehl erlassen. Ihr wurde vorgeworfen, die Ergebnisse der Senatswahl 2007 manipuliert zu haben. Macapagal Arroyo ist Nachfolgerin von Joseph E. Estrada , der nach Verlust seiner Machtbasis als Folge von Korruptionsvorwürfen und des Drucks von Demonstrationen seinen Amtssitz vorzeitig verlassen hatte. Die erst 2006 durchgeführten Vernehmungen entlasteten ihn jedoch weitgehend und wiesen vielmehr auf einen engen Vertrauten Arroyos, Chavit Singson, Gouverneur von Ilocos Sur, der für seine Geschäfte im Bereich des illegalen Glücksspiels schon bekannt war. Nach einer Verurteilung durch ein von ihm nicht anerkanntes Sondergericht („Sandiganbayan“) gewährte ihm Arroyo ein „bedingungsloses Pardon“. [60]\\nEine sinnvolle Politik war deshalb zwischenzeitlich kaum möglich. Die Regierung musste sich ständig gegen neue Beweise ihrer Illegitimität wehren. Gleichzeitig war sie mit der Abwehr vermeintlicher oder tatsächlicher Putschversuche beschäftigt. Um beispielsweise eine öffentliche Ansprache an das Volk in Manila (SONA) zu halten, benötigte die Präsidentin 2006 etwa 13.000 Polizisten/Soldaten.\\nAm 10. Mai 2010 wurden Wahlen (u.\\xa0a. für das Präsidentenamt) auf den Philippinen durchgeführt. Dabei wurde in hohem Maß auf Computertechnik zurückgegriffen, um keinen Zweifel an den Ergebnissen der Wahl zuzulassen. Gleichwohl wurde die Bekanntgabe des endgültigen amtlichen Endergebnisses auch dieses Mal durch Vorwürfe der Wahlmanipulation überschattet. Techniker der beteiligten Firma haben die einfachen Eingriffsmöglichkeiten an den Wahlcomputern detailliert dargelegt. [61] Am 30. Juni 2010 wurde Benigno Aquino III. als Präsident vereidigt. [62]\\nDie philippinische Politik ist sehr personenbezogen, so dass Parteien keine so große Rolle spielen. Viele philippinische Politiker gehören einer politischen Dynastie an: So ist zum Beispiel Macapagal-Arroyo die Tochter des ehemaligen Präsidenten Diosdado Macapagal oder der Sohn von Ferdinand Marcos, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. , auch Bong-Bong genannt, Gouverneur der Heimatprovinz seines Vaters, Ilocos Norte , und der Sohn des ehemaligen Präsidenten Ramon Magsaysay , Ramon Magsaysay jr. , ist Senator. Popularität und regionale Zugehörigkeitsgefühle zählen oft viel mehr als Sachthemen. In den letzten Jahren sind viele Schauspieler, ehemalige Basketballstars und ähnliche Medienpersönlichkeiten in die Politik gegangen.\\nDie Philippinen sind Mitglied im Sicherheitsrat der UN , ASEAN , APEC und der Lateinischen Union .\\n2006 wurden die Philippinen für ein Jahr in den UN-Menschenrechtsrat (engl. Council on Human Rights) aufgenommen. Eine Wiederwahl ist möglich, allerdings auch eine Abwahl wegen massiver Menschenrechtsverletzungen im eigenen Land. Der im Dezember 2006 in Cebu geplante ASEAN-Gipfel wurde kurzfristig angeblich wegen des Wetters abgesagt. Von der Opposition wurde jedoch auch die Angst vor Massenprotesten gegen Versuche, die Verfassung ohne entsprechende Verfahren zu ändern, angeführt. Anfang 2007 informierte sich der UN-Beauftragte Philip Alston über die umstrittene Menschenrechtslage. Nach anfänglichem Widerstand erhielt er den unveröffentlichten vorläufigen Bericht der so genannten „Melo-Kommission“. Hier wird zum ersten Mal auch von offizieller Seite die Verwicklung des Militärs, besonders des Generals Palparan, in die politischen Morde an Linken belegt.\\nDemokratiesituation[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nSeit dem Ende der Marcosdiktatur hat es immer wieder politische Unruhen auf den Philippinen gegeben, so dass keineswegs von einer stabilen Demokratie die Rede sein kann. Im August 1987 und Dezember 1989 gab es Putschversuche des Oberst Gregorio „Gringo“ Honasan . Im Jahr 2003 kam es zu einer Meuterei von Marinesoldaten unter Leutnant Antonio Trillanes, bei der ein Hotel besetzt wurde. Die Soldaten gaben jedoch friedlich auf und wurden vor ein Militärgericht gestellt. Im Jahr 2006 gab es einen angeblichen Putschversuch, der zur Ausrufung eines Notstandes durch Präsidentin Arroyo und zu einigen Verhaftungen führte (siehe Artikel Putschversuch auf den Philippinen 2006 ).\\nSowohl Arroyo als auch Aquino kamen jeweils 2001 und 1986 aufgrund von Demonstrationen und durch Überlaufen führender Militärs an die Macht, so dass formal gesehen die Rechtsstaatlichkeit verletzt wurde. Im Jahr 2001 kam es zu Demonstrationen und zu Krawallen von Estrada-Anhängern, die die neue Präsidentin durch Militär niederschlagen ließ. Es gab Tote und Verletzte. Bis heute ist die politische Situation sehr stark polarisiert. Die offensichtlich gefälschten Wahlen von 2004 und in der Folge zahlreiche politisch motivierte Morde an „Linken“, aber auch Menschenrechtsaktivisten und Ähnliches haben die Situation zusätzlich erschwert.\\nDie Wahlen 2007 brachten trotz massiver Einschüchterungs- und Fälschungsversuche einen Erdrutschsieg für die Opposition. Der wegen des Putschversuchs immer noch inhaftierte Trillanes gewann ohne jeden Wahlkampf einen Senatssitz.\\nAm 29. November 2007 gelang es den Verantwortlichen des Putschversuches von 2003, während einer Anhörung das Gerichtsgebäude von Manila zu verlassen und sich nach einem Marsch durch die Innenstadt von Makati in einem Hotel zu verschanzen. Angeführt wurde die Gruppe von Antonio Trillanes und dem Brigadegeneral Danilo Lim. Ein Aufruf an Soldaten, sich ihnen anzuschließen, blieb aber ohne Wirkung, und die Putschisten ergaben sich schließlich den Sicherheitskräften, als diese drohten, das Hotel zu stürmen. [63]\\nAm 23. November 2009 kam es in der Provinz Maguindanao zu einem Massaker an Zivilisten, bei dem 57 Menschen ermordet wurden. Das Massaker stand im Zusammenhang mit den Wahlen vom 10. Mai 2010. Der Hauptverdächtige aus dem Ampatuanclan hatte angeblich für die damalige Präsidentin Macapagal Arroyo in den Jahren 2004 (Präsidentschaftswahlen) und 2007 (Senatswahlen, Zubiri) die Wahlen massiv gefälscht bzw. fälschen lassen. Die Opposition bekam jeweils 0 Stimmen.\\nDer frühere Botschafter der Philippinen in den USA, Ernesto Maceda, verweist in einem Beitrag der oppositionellen Zeitung „The Daily Tribune“ vom 11. Dezember 2009 [64] [65] darauf, dass schon zuvor 200 Morde und andere Gräueltaten von den Ampatuans in der Gegend verübt wurden, ohne bisher juristische Konsequenzen zu haben.\\nDer Regierung Arroyo wurde 2006 vorgeworfen, über 800 politisch motivierte Morde nicht aufgeklärt zu haben. [66]\\nDie Folge dieser politischen Situation war, dass in den Präsidentschaftswahlen von 2016 der Kandidat der Partei PLP, Rodrigo Duterte , eine Mehrheit erhielt. Er hatte in erster Linie mit einer drakonischen Verfolgung und Bestrafung der Drogenkriminalität geworben.\\nMinderheitenkonflikte[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nVor der Ankunft der Spanier bestanden die Philippinen aus Barangays (Gemeinden) verschiedener Völker und Stämme, die vielfältig untereinander vernetzt waren. Spanien kolonisierte den größten Teil des Archipels und in 300 Jahren entstand eine Philippinische Mehrheitsidentität. In einigen Gebieten, wie in den Philippinischen Kordilleren mit den Stämmen der Igorot im Norden und den Gebieten der Moro und Lumad im Süden, wurden die Menschen kaum beeinflusst.\\nDie spanische Kolonialzeit prägte die unter ihrer Kontrolle stehenden Menschen: die erlittene Ausbeutung, das feudale Wirtschaftssystem, später das halbfeudale Hazienda-System, die zentralisierte Regierung, die christlichen und spanischen Einflüsse. Und sie schaffte die Minderheiten: die Menschen, die an der Peripherie der wirtschaftlichen, kulturellen und politischen Veränderungen lebten und ihre indigenen Traditionen bewahrten. [67]\\nTerror und Konflikt[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nVor allem im Süden Mindanaos kommt es immer wieder zu bewaffneten Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Rebellen der separatistischen MNLF ( Nationale Befreiungsfront der Moros ), der islamistischen MILF ( Islamische Befreiungsfront der Moros ) und Regierungstruppen. Die MNLF regiert heute die Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (deutsch: autonome Region im muslimischen Mindanao), während die islamistische MILF sich weiter für einen eigenständigen Moslem-Staat einsetzt, der aus den Inseln Mindanao, Palawan , Basilan und dem Sulu-Archipel bestehen soll. Die Abu Sayyaf sind wiederum eine terroristische Gruppe, die durch Entführungen und Anschläge bekannt wurde.\\nIm Zuge dieser Auseinandersetzungen kommt es auch immer wieder zu terroristischen Angriffen, wie etwa den Bombenanschlägen auf den internationalen Flughafen in Davao City im Frühjahr 2003 sowie auf ein Hafenterminal in Davao etwa zur selben Zeit. Beide Anschläge forderten mehrere Todesopfer. Des Weiteren kommt es immer wieder zu religiös begründeten Anschlägen auf christliche Kirchen. Aufgrund dieser Gefährdungssituation wurden unter anderem vom deutschen Auswärtigen Amt in der Vergangenheit mehrmals Reisewarnungen für die Philippinen herausgegeben und es wurde insbesondere von Reisen nach Mindanao abgeraten.\\nEs handelt sich nur oberflächlich betrachtet um einen reinen Religionskonflikt. Eine andere der zugrunde liegenden Ursachen ist beispielsweise das von den Vereinigten Staaten durchgesetzte Landgesetz von 1903, das Christen gestattete, bis zu 23\\xa0ha Land zu besitzen, während der Landbesitz für die muslimische und nichtchristliche Bevölkerung auf 10\\xa0ha begrenzt war. Dieses Gesetz bildete nur einen Baustein einer andauernden systematischen Enteignungskampagne. In den 1950er Jahren wurde die systematische Einwanderung christlicher Siedler nach Mindanao durch die philippinische Zentralregierung in Manila gefördert. Die muslimischen Einwohner wurden damit in ihren angestammten Gebieten zur Minderheit.\\nDiese Faktoren führten letztlich zu einem der größten vergessenen Kriege unserer Zeit: Der Bürgerkrieg auf Mindanao forderte von den 1970er Jahren bis 2002 nach Angaben der Weltbank mindestens 120.000 Opfer, die Mehrzahl von ihnen Zivilisten. Zahlreiche Versuche zu ernsthaften Friedensabschlüssen zu gelangen scheiterten bisher, unter anderem an einer fehlenden langfristigen Perspektive für die Region, die einen fairen Interessenausgleich aller Beteiligten und Betroffenen bietet.\\nAm 27. März 2014 unterzeichneten die philippinische Regierung und die islamische Befreiungsfront der Moros (MILF) das Friedensabkommen zur Schaffung der politisch selbständigen Region Bangsamoro im Süden der Philippinen. [68]\\nEnde Mai 2017 verhängte Präsident Duterte das Kriegsrecht über Mindanao, nachdem in der Stadt Marawi etwa 100 islamistische Rebellen Angriffe durchgeführt hatten. [69] (Siehe hierzu auch: Schlacht um Maute 2017 ). Dieser Konflikt führte zu einem stärkeren Engagement Chinas, das der Regierung Duterte im Sommer 2017 Militärhilfe im Wert von mehreren Millionen Dollar zukommen liess. [70]\\nMenschenrechte[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nSeit Ende der 1960er Jahre schwelt in den Philippinen ein bewaffneter Konflikt zwischen muslimischen Guerillatruppen (insbesondere MILF , MNLF , Abu Sayyaf ), linksgerichteten Guerillatruppen (insbesondere New People's Army (NPA)), Paramilitärs insbesondere den legalen Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) und der regulären philippinischen Armee. Sämtliche beteiligte Parteien machten und machen sich schwersten Menschenrechtsverletzungen schuldig. Die Opfer stammen mehrheitlich aus der Zivilbevölkerung. Besonders gefährdet sind Umweltaktivisten , Journalisten , Menschenrechtler , Gewerkschaftsvertreter , Kleinbauern , indigene Gemeinschaften und vermeintlich linksgerichtete NGOs . Sehr viele Menschen wurden während dieser Konflikte aus ihren angestammten Orten gewaltsam vertrieben, insbesondere aus Mindanao, dort mussten rund eine halbe Million Menschen während der letzten großen militärischen Auseinandersetzung 2008/2009 aus ihren Dörfern fliehen.\\nDie philippinische Regierung verabschiedete 2011 einen „Internal Peace and Security Plan“ (IPSP) oder „Operationsplans Nachbarschaftshilfe“ (Oplan Bayanihan), um die Aufstandsbekämpfung weiter voranzutreiben. Die Erfolge sind jedoch mager, führten vielmehr zu einer verstärkten Militarisierung der Gesellschaft. [71] [72] [73]\\nDie Lage der Menschenrechte verbesserte sich deutlich nach dem Ende der Marcos-Diktatur. Unter der Präsidentin Macapagal-Arroyo (2001 bis 2010) verschlechterte sich die Situation erheblich und erreichte das Niveau der überwundenen Diktaturzeit. Insbesondere erreichte die Anzahl von außergerichtlichen Hinrichtungen und dem erzwungenen Verschwindenlassen einen Negativrekord, dazu kommt die übliche Folterpraxis von Regierungsgegnern. Während ihrer Amtszeit dokumentierte die philippinische Menschenrechtsorganisation Karapatan 1.206 Fälle politischer Morde, 206 weitere Personen wurden Opfer von erzwungenem Verschwindenlassen. Diese Entwicklung wurde von nationalen und internationalen staatlichen und nicht-staatlichen Organisation sowie der UN dokumentiert und scharf kritisiert. Die Interpretationen unterscheiden sich sehr stark zwischen der Bewertung der nationalen Melo-Kommission und dem UN-Sonderberichterstatter.\\nDie wichtigsten Schattenberichte dieser Entwicklung von wichtigen nationalen und internationalen NGOs:\\nAmnesty International (2006): Philippinen: Politische Morde, Menschenrechte und der Friedensprozess.

Doch die in ihn gesetzten Hoffnungen als Sohn der ehemaligen Präsidentin Corazon Aquino und des ermordeten vormaligen Senators Benigno Aquino, Jr. blieben aus, nach wie vor kommt es zu schweren Menschenrechtsverletzungen: Karapatan zählt seit der Amtsübernahme von Aquino III 238 außergerichtliche Hinrichtungen (davon knapp die Hälfte sind Vertreter von Organisationen), 26 Mal erzwungenes Verschwindenlassen und 110 Folteropfer. [84] Weiterhin kennzeichnend für die problematische Menschenrechtslage ist das Klima der Straflosigkeit, die Kriminalisierung von Menschenrechtsverteidigern und dem Red-Baiting von zivilgesellschaftlichen Gruppen (Stigmatisierung als vermeintliche Kommunisten, die verfolgt werden). [85] [86] Die Anzahl an ermordeten Journalisten ist hoch, trotz formaler Pressefreiheit: Reporter ohne Grenzen führen seit 2013 die Philippinen in der Liste der fünf gefährlichsten Länder. „Auf den Philippinen schießen immer öfter Bewaffnete von Motorrädern aus Journalisten auf offener Straße nieder, ohne Strafen fürchten zu müssen.“ 2013 wurden acht Journalisten getötet. [87] Seit dem Massaker in Maguindanao 2009 mit allein 30 getöteten Journalisten sind weitere 33 ermordet worden. [88] Der amtierende Präsident Rodrigo Duterte bekräftigte bereits in seinem Wahlkampf, dass er die Kriminalität auf den Philippinen ausrotten und Drogendealer erschießen lassen will. Er befürwortete auch eine Lynchjustiz gegen Drogenabhängige. Menschenrechtler werfen Duterte vor, zahlreiche Todesschwadronen geduldet zu haben, die Hunderte Drogendealer umbrachten. Zahlreiche Medien berichteten, dass seit dem Amtsantritt von Duterte bereits 465 mutmaßliche Rauschgifthändler umgebracht worden seien. [89] [90] [91] [92] Mehr als 160 Richtern, Polizisten, und Militärs wirft Duterte unter anderem Mittäterschaft vor da sie, laut seinen Angaben, direkte Verbindungen zur Drogenmafia pflegen. In einer Rede, die er am 7. August 2016 in Davao hielt, nannte er namentlich neun Richter sowie mehr als 50 amtierende oder ehemalige Abgeordnete, Bürgermeister und andere Politiker, die angeblich in den Rauschgifthandel verwickelt seien. Auch im Ruhestand befindliche Polizisten und Militärs wurden aufgefordert, sich beim Obersten Gericht oder ihren Vorgesetzten zu melden. In seiner Rede gab er in derselben Weise bekannt, dass er mit zahlreichen Beschuldigungen auch falsch liegen könnte. Der Sekretär der Presidential Communications Group , Martin Andanar , gab bekannt, dass gegen die Verdächtigen ein Strafverfahren eingeleitet werden würde. [93]\\n\", 105]\n",
      "[0.000272948008096041, 'Miners shun mineral wealth of the Philippines\\nBy DONALD GREENLEES\\nContinue reading the main story\\nMANILA — When the Australian miner Rusina started to extract nickel from its mining concession on the island of Luzon in March, the first major problem it faced was what to do about a highly organized illegal mining operation.\\nThe illegal miners working on Rusina\\'s property did not feel the need to conceal their activity. Dozens of trucks, bearing the logo of a local contractor, lined up at the mine site to cart the stolen nickel ore away.\\n\"The brazenness is incredible,\" Rusina Mining\\'s managing director, Robert Gregory,  said.\\nBy mid-April, more nickel ore had been removed from the property by the illegal miners than Rusina\\'s own operations. Gregory estimates that 50,000 tons of ore, valued at about $4.5 million, had been taken by his unlawful competition.\\nThree other miners, with concessions adjacent to Rusina\\'s in Zambales Province, 250 kilometers, or 150 miles,  north of Manila, had experienced the same fate. Nine container ships had already sailed from the nearby port of Santa Cruz with an estimated 450,000 tons of ore. Another 200,000 tons was waiting on the dock.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nA 2005 decision by the Philippine Supreme Court to uphold the constitutional validity of a law allowing 100 percent foreign ownership of mines should have opened the floodgates of investment.\\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision, the administration of the President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo identified mining as one of the key drivers of future economic growth.  It estimates that  as much as $9 billion in new investment could flow into the industry by 2011.\\nBut miners and mining analysts say the money is still only trickling in to exploration and the opening of new mines. Excessive and slow regulatory procedures, laws that give local governments significant power over the exploitation of mineral resources, the invasion of mining concessions by illegal miners or small-scale mining operators,  and security problems surrounding many mines in remote regions are all blamed for discouraging investment.\\nThe Fraser Institute, one of the leading international mining research groups, ranks the Philippines as one of the five most mineral-rich countries in the world, but, in an annual survey, places it near the bottom of the 65 mining regions and countries as an investment destination, only slightly better than Zimbabwe.\\nThe Philippines government estimates mineral wealth of $1 trillion. It is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa, and one of the largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite and zinc.\\n\"Philippine resources are among the best in the world,  so miners have to take an interest,\" said Peter Wallace, a Manila-based business consultant, who has written extensively on the country\\'s mining industry.\\n\"But there are other places for miners to put their money, so they don\\'t have to come here,\" he said. \"What we are seeing is small miners come in, take the exploration risk  and then try to sell on to the majors. But we have not had a lot of investment from the majors yet.\"\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nSome major companies, like BHP Billiton and Anglo-American, have carried out exploration, but have been wary about committing to new projects.\\nThe president of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, Benjamin Philip Romualdez,  said that the legal impediments to foreign investment had been resolved, and that  all that remained was for \"companies to work through the process under the mining law to push their investments through to commercial operation.\"\\nMining in the Philippines also suffers a significant domestic image problem.  Mining  in the past has caused serious environmental damage, antagonizing local communities and powerful interest groups, like the Catholic Church, to which 85 percent of Filipinos belong.\\nThe worst environmental disaster occurred in 1996,  when an earthquake caused a drainage tunnel to collapse at a copper mine on Marinduque Island, contaminating a river. A United Nations assessment mission described the situation as an \"environmental disaster.\"\\nThe owner, Marcopper Mining, was a joint venture between Placer Dome, of Canada, and a Filipino businessman. In an attempted rehabilitation, Placer Dome paid $70 million in compensation to affected villagers. The Boac River was considered biologically dead soon after the spillage.\\nThis incident and others hardened attitudes among environmentalists and communities against multinational miners. The Marcopper disaster was followed by a legal challenge to a 1995 mining law that allowed foreign interests to wholly own a mining operation. The effect was to halt almost all new foreign investment in the industry for a decade.\\nNewsletter Sign Up\\nPlease verify you\\'re not a robot by clicking the box.\\nInvalid email address.

Arroyo set up a high-powered committee,  the Mineral Development Council,  to help coordinate policy and respond to the industry\\'s needs.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nMiners say they are particularly concerned by the slow pace at which the government issues mining permits, the lack of coordination between local governments and the national  government and an often poor security situation around mine sites.\\nBut in an interview, Arroyo said the miners  have to do more to ensure they win over the communities in which they operate. She said environmental and community relations problems surrounding some mining projects in the past \"contributes to the skepticism\" of many Filipinos toward mining.\\n\"I want to cut down on red tape, including in the mining bureaucracy, but having said that,  I also want to make sure that we are able to ferret out the responsible miners from the fly-by-nighters,\" Arroyo said.\\n\"It\\'s really very important that we make sure that the mining investor works not only for the company but also for the community,\"  she said.\\nBig miners say it is local communities that have been losing out from the way mining has been managed in the past. A 1991 Small-Scale Mining Act allows provincial governments to issue permits to almost anyone who can afford a pick and a shovel. The small operators in theory sell ore to contractors to ship or refine.\\nBut in practice a lot of small miners are backed by highly organized syndicates. They have used locally issued permits to invade concessions owned by other miners, failed to effectively exploit the mineral wealth of an area, caused environmental damage without cleaning up and paid few taxes back to the communities, analysts and foreign miners say.\\nSome areas, like the Diwalwal gold field on the southern island of Mindanao, have become gun-totting no-go zones.\\n\"Even the police won\\'t go there,\" said Gregory, the Rusina manager. \"Millions of ounces are squandered, recoveries are way down.

ERIK DE CASTROREUTERS\\nTwitter\\n@iaranau\\n09/05/2016 20:59\\nRodrigo Duterte , el controvertido político de 71 años que ha prometido acabar con la inseguridad y la corrupción en Filipinas, se ha alzado este lunes con la Presidencia del país al conseguir casi el 40% de los votos emitidos, con una ciudadanía que ha optado por un líder visto como fuerte pese al riesgo que su elección implica para los derechos humanos y las libertades civiles.\\nEl que fuera durante 22 años alcalde de Davao, la tercera ciudad de país, se ha convertido en el 16º presidente de esta pujante nación asiática de 100 millones de habitantes, imponiéndose con holgura en una jornada precedida por una campaña pródiga en salidas de tono y acusaciones de todo tipo. El propio Duterte fue protagonista de varios de estos episodios, como cuando se burló de la violación y muerte de una misionera en un motín carcelario, llamó \"hijo de puta\" al Papa en una de las naciones más católicas del planeta o alardeó de su animada vida sexual y su afición por tomar viagra.\\nA falta de contabilizar el 15% de votos, la Comisión Electoral de Filipinas ha informado de que Duterte había conseguido 14,2 millones de votos, un 38,6% del total. En segundo lugar se sitúa Manuel Roxas con el 23%, mientras que la tercera posición es para la senadora Grace Poe, que obtiene el 21%. Además, los 55 millones de electores han decidido este lunes la suerte de otros 18.000 cargos públicos.\\nApodado \\'Duterte el sucio\\', \\'el castigador\\' o \\'el Donald Trump filipino\\', sus detractores han avisado de que su estilo autoritario corre el riesgo de hacer que el país vuelva a convertirse en una dictadura como las sufridas en el pasado. De hecho, el propio Duterte amenazó durante la campaña con disolver el Congreso e imponer un \"Gobierno revolucionario\" si sus reformas encuentran resistencia. \"¿Si soy un dictador? Sí, es cierto\", aseguró en respuesta a las acusaciones de la oposición en uno de sus actos.\\nPero, a pesar de las críticas y las acusaciones, este hombre ha sido capaz de encandilar, con su estilo marrullero y sus promesas de justicia y de reparto de riqueza, a una población harta de ver cómo el espectacular crecimiento que desde hace años vive la economía del archipiélago no se traduce en mejoras tangibles en su vida diaria.\\nEn Filipinas, 40 familias controlan el 76% de la fortuna nacional, y unas docenas de dinastías politicoeconómicas manejan las riendas del Estado desde hace generaciones. Frente a esta oligarquía, Duterte se presentó como un hombre sencillo independiente de la élite gobernante lo que, sumado a sus promesas de mano dura contra el crimen que azota el país, lo auparon hace semanas a lo más alto de las encuestas.\\nDuterte se ha comprometido a terminar con la criminalidad en seis meses, aunque para ello tenga que ejecutar a unos 100.000 delincuentes. No en vano, en sus años como alcalde, al ahora presidente se le relacionó con los escuadrones de la muerte que acabaron a tiro limpio con camellos y violadores de la sureña Davao y convirtieron la ciudad más peligrosa del país en la más segura de todas. \"Olvidaos de las leyes de derechos humanos\" declaró al cierre de su campaña.\"Si llego al palacio presidencial, haré como hice de alcalde. Traficantes, ladrones y maleantes, haríais mejor en iros\" aseguró farruco.\\nSu estilo encaja con una campaña en la que la violencia ha jugado un papel muy destacado, algo por otra parte típico en Filipinas. Durante los meses previos, hasta 15 personas fueron asesinadas en relación con el proceso electoral, y este lunes otras 10 han perdido la vida en diferentes incidentes.\\nAdemás de las deficiencias en las infraestructuras o la arraigada corrupción, Duterte también deberá tomar las riendas del proceso de paz en el conflicto que padece el Sur, mayoritariamente musulmán, desde hace lustros, en el que han muerto unas 150.000 personas en la lucha entre guerrilleros y ejército; o las disputas territoriales que mantiene con la vecina China , cuyas reclamaciones de soberanía en el Mar de China Meridional chocan con las pretensiones filipinas.\\nEn la apretada carrera por hacerse con la Vicepresidencia, Ferdinand \\'Bongbong\\' Marcos Jr., hijo del antiguo dictador y s u esposa Imelda , aventaja en tan sólo 0,2% puntos a Maria Leonor Robredo, por lo que hay que esperar hasta contar el 100% de los votos para saber quién será el segundo en la jerarquía del país asiático.\\nNoticias relacionadas\\n', 132]\n",

The BBC News website looks at the main rebel factions now operating in the area.\\nClick on the links below for more on each group.\\nFollowers of Islam - called Moros or Moors by the Spanish - make up a sizeable population of the region.\\nThe Moro National Liberation Front first appeared in the early 1970s, fighting for an independent Moro nation.\\nThe group signed a peace agreement with the Manila Government in 1976, but this failed to stick.\\nAnother agreement, signed in 1996, gave predominantly Muslim areas a degree of self-rule, setting up the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).\\nThe ARMM is composed of the mainland provinces of Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur, and the island provinces of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Basilan.\\nAs part of the deal, the MNLF chairman and founder of the group, Nur Misuari, was installed as the new regional governor.\\nBut his rule ended in violence in November 2001, when he led a failed uprising. He is now in jail.\\nAnother MNLF leader, Parouk Hussin, took over as ARMM governor in 2002.\\nParouk Hussin still retains a loyal support base, but the MNLF has become weaker over the years, and many factions have splintered from the main group.\\nNur Misuari still has a small band of followers, who remain actively opposed to the current situation.\\nIn February 2005, supporters loyal to Misuari launched a series of attacks on army troops in Jolo, the largest of the Sulu islands.\\nThe trigger for the violence was thought to be the launch of a huge military operation to target the armed Muslim group Abu Sayyaf - which is alleged to have ties with the Misuari faction.\\nThere were no major skirmishes until August 2007, when the group said it was behind an ambush on troops in Jolo which led to some of the heaviest fighting in recent years, with nearly 60 dead.\\nMNLF said the ambush had been in retaliation for an army offensive a day earlier that killed four of its members, including a commander.\\nMoro Islamic Liberation Front  (MILF)\\nThe Moro Islamic Liberation Front is a more militant rebel group, which split from the MNLF in 1977.\\nThe MILF has a long-term aim of creating a separate Islamic state in the southern Philippines, but analysts say the group may well settle for a certain degree of Muslim autonomy.\\nThe MILF puts more emphasis on its Islamic roots than the MNLF. Many of its senior figures are clerics.\\nBased in central Mindanao, the MILF has broad popular support in rural areas, where the lack of economic development has encouraged dissent.\\nThe 12,500-strong group was subject to a crackdown in 2000 under the army of then-president Joseph Estrada.\\nRebels groups in Mindanao\\nMILF: 12,000 members, 9,000 firearms\\nCPP/NPA: 3,400 members, 2,300 firearms\\nAbu Sayyaf: 450 members, 350 firearms\\nMisuari followers: 450 members, 450 firearms\\nPentagon group: 200 members, 40 firearms\\nSource: Army intelligence figures 2003\\nBut the mood turned when Gloria Arroyo took power, after Mr Estrada was deposed amid popular protests in 2001.\\nTalks between Manila and the rebels were revived, although they stumbled to a halt a couple of years later when the group was accused of harbouring a gang accused of kidnapping foreigners.\\nMILF was also accused of being behind a bomb blast at Davao City airport in March 2003 which killed 21 people - and multiple murder charges were filed against the group\\'s founder and then leader, Salamat Hashim.\\nBut as 2003 wore on, there were signs of a breakthrough in relations between Manila and the MILF.\\nShortly before his death from a heart attack in July 2003, Salamat Hashim issued a statement renouncing terrorism and underlining the MILF\\'s commitment to achieving a peace settlement.\\nA ceasefire was agreed that year, and both sides have since been engaged in trying to negotiate a peace deal.\\nOne factor which is complicating this process is the allegation that MILF has links with foreign terrorists - including Jemaah Islamiah, the South East Asian group blamed for the 2002 Bali bombings. The MILF denies the claims.\\nDespite the truce, skirmishes continue between troops and MILF militants.\\nIn July 2007, MILF fighters were involved in clashes on Basilan island that left 14 Philippine troops dead, 10 of them reportedly beheaded.\\nMILF said the military had violated the ceasefire agreement by entering its territory without permission, but denied beheading the soldiers or kidnapping the Italian priest which the troops were searching for.\\nAbu Sayyaf\\nAbu Sayyaf is the smallest and most radical of the Islamic separatist groups in the southern Philippines.\\nIt is best-known for a series of kidnappings of Western nationals and Filipinos, for which it has received several large ransom payments.\\nGloria Arroyo restarted negotiations with the MILF\\nIn June 2002, US-trained Philippine commandos tried to rescue three hostages being held on Basilan island. Two of the hostages - one an American citizen - were killed in the resulting shootout.\\nThe group has also claimed responsibility for a series of bomb attacks over the years - including an attack on a passenger ferry in Manila Bay in February 2004 that killed 100 people.\\nAbu Sayyaf\\'s stated goal is an independent Islamic state in Mindanao and the Sulu islands, but the government views the rebels as little more than criminals, and refuses to hold any form of talks with them.\\nAbu Sayyaf - which means \"Sword of God\" in Arabic - split from the MNLF in 1991, under the leadership of Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani, who was killed in a clash with Philippine police in December 1998.\\nHis younger brother, Khadafi Janjalani, took over as leader, although he was killed by Philippines troops in September 2006.\\nNationwide support for Abu Sayyaf is limited, but analysts say many locals in its stronghold areas of Jolo and Basilan tolerate the rebels and even work for them, attracted by the prospect of receiving lucrative ransom payments.\\nBoth the MNLF and MILF have condemned the Abu Sayyaf\\'s activities, and the US has included the group in its list of \"terrorist\" organisations, saying it has links with Osama Bin Laden\\'s al-Qaeda network.\\nUS troops have been helping the Philippines military fight Abu Sayyaf, although they are limited to a training and advisory position as the Philippine constitution bans foreign troops from taking part in actual combat.\\nSince launching a major operation in August 2006, Manila has claimed a series of successes - including the deaths of Janjalani and another senior Abu Sayyaf leader, Abu Sulaiman, also known as Jainal Antal Sali, in January 2007.\\nReports in June 2007 said Abu Sayyaf had chosen Yasser Igasan, one of the group\\'s founders, to succeed Janjalani as leader.\\nBut military chiefs believe Abu Sayyaf\\'s numbers have now fallen to around 200, and they talk confidently of one day wiping out the rebel group entirely.\\nNew People\\'s Army (NPA)\\nThe New People\\'s Army is the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and has been in existence for more than 30 years.\\nThe group, based on the island of Mindanao, has an estimated 10,000 members according to a presidential adviser on the peace process.\\nGovernment troops have been told to hunt down the Abu Sayyaf\\nPeace talks between the CPP and the Philippine Government stalled in June 2001, after the NPA admitted killing a Filipino congressman.\\nThe CPP/NPA was added to Washington\\'s list of foreign \"terrorist\" organisations in August 2002.\\nShortly afterwards, at a request from the Americans, the Dutch Government cancelled benefit payments to group members living in the Netherlands.\\nMany of the NPA\\'s senior figures, including its founder Jose Maria Sison, live in self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and direct operations from there.\\nUnlike the Americans, the Philippine Government does not class the Maoist group as a terrorism organisation.\\nIn February 2004 a peace process was revived, with representatives of the NPA meeting government officials in the Norwegian capital Oslo.\\nThe two sides agreed a series of measures to move towards a formal peace deal.\\nThese included setting up a joint commission to examine human rights abuses on both sides, and working together for the removal of the NPA from the US and EU\\'s list of terrorist organisations.\\n', 145]\n",

Development of San Vicente, a 13- to 14-kilometer strip of white sand compared to Boracay’s four, is to be led by the private sector, which is currently scrambling over plots of land.\\nTourism’s pocket “ace”\\nThe Philippine tourism industry has become the recipient of greater attention thanks to an effective advertising campaign – “It’s more fun in the Philippines” – boosting arrival numbers like never before. Asian markets remain the fastest growing source of tourists, prompting analysts to purchase interests in the high potential of the sector’s gaming and entertainment segment.\\nAccording to DOT figures, arrivals to the Philippines from Malaysia grew 24 per cent in 2012, followed by the 10.46 per cent increase from Taiwan to 216,500 and 3.86 per cent from Japan to 412,400.\\nTo meet the spike in demand from entertainment-seeking arrivals, four mixed entertainment complexes are slated to come up in the National Capital Region by end-2013, including the Solaire Resort & Casino, a high-end complex in Parañaque City.\\n“Ever since the [It’s more fun in the Philippines] campaign came out, people have been noticing the Philippines a lot more, and coincidentally the gaming industry has been opening better casinos,” Certified Securities Representative Liam Ong at Accord Capital told Inside Investor.\\n“Solaire is opening on March 16, and for now I think that’s the ace in the gaming industry.”\\nThe state-led project will open with 500 rooms, taking on an additional 800 rooms by 2014, and growing to over 2,000 rooms by 2016.\\n\\xa0\\n', 179]\n",

      "[0.0001667011381307682, \"History\\nHistorical Perspective of the Philippine Educational System\\nEducation in the Philippines has undergone several stages of development from the pre-Spanish times to the present. In meeting the needs of the society, education serves as focus of emphases/priorities of the leadership at certain periods/epochs in our national struggle as a race.\\nAs early as in pre-Magellanic times, education was informal, unstructured, and devoid of methods. Children were provided more vocational training and less academics (3 Rs) by their parents and in the houses of tribal tutors.\\nThe pre-Spanish system of education underwent major changes during the Spanish colonization. The tribal tutors were replaced by the Spanish Missionaries. Education was religion-oriented. It was for the elite, especially in the early years of Spanish colonization. Access to education by the Filipinos was later liberalized through the enactment of the Educational Decree of 1863 which provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town under the responsibility of the municipal government; and the establishment of a normal school for male teachers under the supervision of the Jesuits. Primary instruction was free and the teaching of Spanish was compulsory. Education during that period was inadequate, suppressed, and controlled.\\nThe defeat of Spain by American forces paved the way for Aguinaldo's Republic under a Revolutionary Government. The schools maintained by Spain for more than three centuries were closed for the time being but were reopened on August 29, 1898 by the Secretary of Interior. The Burgos Institute in Malolos, the Military Academy of Malolos, and the Literary University of the Philippines were established. A system of free and compulsory elementary education was established by the Malolos Constitution.\\nAn adequate secularized and free public school system during the first decade of American rule was established upon the recommendation of the Schurman Commission. Free primary instruction that trained the people for the duties of citizenship and avocation was enforced by the Taft Commission per instructions of President McKinley. Chaplains and non-commissioned officers were assigned to teach using English as the medium of instruction.\\nA highly centralized public school system was installed in 1901 by the Philippine Commission by virtue of Act No. 74. The implementation of this Act created a heavy shortage of teachers so the Philippine Commission authorized the Secretary of Public Instruction to bring to the Philippines 600 teachers from the U.S.A. They were the Thomasites.\\nYear\\nSuperior Commission of Primary Instruction\\nChairman\\nAct.

In 1908, the Philippine Legislature approved Act No. 1870 which created the University of the Philippines.\\nThe Reorganization Act of 1916 provided the Filipinization of all department secretaries except the Secretary of Public Instruction.\\nJapanese educational policies were embodied in Military Order No. 2 in 1942. The Philippine Executive Commission established the Commission of Education, Health and Public Welfare and schools were reopened in June 1942. On October 14, 1943, the Japanese - sponsored Republic created the Ministry of Education. Under the Japanese regime, the teaching of Tagalog, Philippine History, and Character Education was reserved for Filipinos. Love for work and dignity of labor was emphasized. On February 27, 1945, the Department of Instruction was made part of the Department of Public Instruction.\\nIn 1947, by virtue of Executive Order No. 94, the Department of Instruction was changed to Department of Education. During this period, the regulation and supervision of public and private schools belonged to the Bureau of Public and Private Schools.\\nIn 1972, it became the Department of Education and Culture by virtue of Proclamation 1081 and the Ministry of Education and Culture in 1978 y virtue of P.D. No. 1397. Thirteen regional offices were created and major organizational changes were implemented in the educational system.\\nThe Education Act of 1982 created the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports which later became the Department of Education, Culture and Sports in 1987 by virtue of Executive Order No. 117. The structure of DECS as embodied in EO No. 117 has practically remained unchanged until 1994 when the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), and 1995 when the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) were established to supervise tertiary degree programs and non-degree technical-vocational programs, respectively.\\nThe Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) report provided the impetus for Congress to pass RA 7722 and RA 7796 in 1994 creating the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), respectively.\\nThe trifocal education system refocused DECS’ mandate to basic education which covers elementary, secondary and nonformal education, including culture and sports. TESDA now administers the post-secondary, middle-level manpower training and development while CHED is responsible for higher education.\\nIn August 2001, Republic Act 9155, otherwise called the Governance of Basic Education Act, was passed transforming the name of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) to the Department of Education (DepEd) and redefining the role of field offices (regional offices, division offices, district offices and schools). RA 9155 provides the overall framework for (i) school head empowerment by strengthening their leadership roles and (ii) school-based management within the context of transparency and local accountability. The goal of basic education is to provide the school age population and young adults with skills, knowledge, and values to become caring, self-reliant, productive and patriotic citizens.\\nDepEd Management Structure\\nTo carry out its mandates and objectives, the Department is organized into two major structural components. The Central Office maintains the overall administration of basic education at the national level. The Field Offices are responsible for the regional and local coordination and administration of the Department’s mandate. RA 9155 provides that the Department should have no more than four Undersecretaries and four Assistant Secretaries with at least one Undersecretary and one Assistant Secretary who are career service officers chosen among the staff of the Department. (See DepEd Organizational Chart.)\\nAt present, the Department operates with four Undersecretaries in the areas of: (1) Programs and Projects; (2) Regional Operations; (3) Finance and Administration; and (4) Legal Affairs; four Assistant Secretaries in the areas of: (1) Programs and Projects; (2) Planning and Development; (3) Budget and Financial Affairs; and (4) Legal Affairs.\\nBackstopping the Office of the Secretary at the Central Office are the different services, bureaus and centers. The five services are the Administrative Service, Financial and Management Service, Human Resource Development Service, Planning Service, and Technical Service. Three staff bureaus provide assistance in formulating policies, standards, and programs related to curriculum and staff development. These are the Bureau of Elementary Education (BEE), Bureau of Secondary Education (BSE), and the Bureau of Nonformal Education (BNFE).

Except for the 1942-45 Japanese occupation during World War II, the Philippines had been under U.S. administration since the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898.\\nThe U.S.-Philippine Bilateral Strategic Dialogue advances discussion and cooperation on bilateral, regional, and global issues. U.S.-Philippine relations are based on strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and human rights. The United States has designated the Philippines as a Major Non-NATO Ally, and there are close and abiding security ties between the two nations. The Manila Declaration signed in 2011 reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty as the foundation for a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. There is also a focus on economic, commercial, and people-to-people ties. There are an estimated four million U.S. citizens of Philippine ancestry in the United States, and more than 220,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines, including a large presence of United States veterans. An estimated 650,000 U.S. citizens visit the Philippines each year. Many people-to-people programs exist between the United States and the Philippines, including Fulbright, International Visitor Leadership Program, and the Kenney-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study program.\\nManila is home to the only VA benefits office and healthcare clinic outside the United States, and the American Cemetery in Manila is the largest American military cemetery outside the United States.\\nU.S. Assistance to Philippines\\nThe U.S. government’s goal in the Philippines is to partner with the country to become a stable and prosperous nation. The 2011 Partnership for Growth Statement of Principles reinforced a shared interest in promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth in the Philippines. U.S. assistance to the Philippines fosters broad-based economic growth; improves the health and education of Filipinos; promotes peace and security; advances democratic values, good governance, and human rights; and strengthens regional and global partnerships. Department of State, Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao aim to strengthen the foundation for peace and stability in the area. U.S. assistance, including from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, seeks to intensify cooperation through a whole-of-government approach, using a wide range of assistance and other foreign policy tools. The United States has had a Peace Corps program in the Philippines for over 50 years.\\nOver the last decade, disaster relief and recovery has also become an increasingly important area of assistance to the Philippines. The United States has provided over $143 million in assistance to date to the people of the Philippines in relief and recovery efforts after Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda devastated the country in 2013. The United States continues to support long-term reconstruction and rebuilding efforts.\\nBilateral Economic Relations\\nThe United States and the Philippines have a strong trade and investment relationship, with over $25 billion in goods and services traded. The United States is one of the largest foreign investors in the Philippines, and is the Philippines’ third-largest trading partner. The Philippines has been among the largest beneficiaries of the Generalized System of Preferences program for developing countries, which provides preferential duty-free access to the U.S. market.\\nKey imports from the Philippines are semiconductor devices and computer peripherals, automobile parts, electric machinery, textiles and garments, wheat and animal feeds, coconut oil, and information technology/business process outsourcing services. Key U.S. exports to the Philippines are machinery, cereals, raw and semi-processed materials for the manufacture of semiconductors, electronics, and transport equipment. The two countries have a bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, signed in 1989, and a tax treaty.\\nThe Embassy is working to advance several key Environment, Science, Technology, and Health issues. The Philippines is an important partner on climate change and submitted an “intended nationally determined contribution” (INDC) prior to the December 2015 COP 21 meetings in Paris. USAID is providing key technical assistance to help ensure the Philippines’ INDC is meaningful and science-based.\\nPhilippines's Membership in International Organizations\\nThe Philippines and the United States belong to a many of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN Regional Forum, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. The Philippines is also an observer to the Organization of American States. The Philippines serves as chair and host of ASEAN for 2017.\\nBilateral Representation\\nThe U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines is Sung Y. Kim ; other principal embassy officials are listed in the Department's Key Officers List.\\nThe Philippines maintains an embassy in the United States at 1600 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036 (tel. 202-467-9300).\\nMore information about Philippines is available from the Department of State and other sources, some of which are listed here:\\n\", 135]\n",
      "[9.599442657614999e-05, 'Philippine Tourism > Where to go\\nFrom http://www.dotpcvc.gov.ph/\\nBanaue of Painterly Dreams\\nBecause of its high altitude, Banaue is often        described as \"where land merges with the clouds to meet        the heavens\" with the rice terraces as \"the stairway to        the sky.\"\\nBanaue is a place for nature adventures and cultural        immersion. Days are for indulging in such activities as        strolling, biking, and trekking. Evenings are for        campfire chats at a village or warm indoor cosseting at        the lodges and inns.\\nA leading tourism destination in Asia, the Banaue rice        terraces start from the base of the Cordilleras and        reach up to several thousand feet high. Its length, if        stretched from end to end, could encircle half of the        globe.\\nThe rice paddies are fed by mountain springs and streams        that are channeled into an irrigation canal that runs        downhill through the terraces.\\nIn the village of Batad, the terraces take the shape of        an amphitheater and can be reached by a 12-kilometer        ride from Banaue Hotel and a 2-hour hike through        mountain trails.\\nAfter trekking through the terraces, cool retreats indeed are the        spring-fed stream of Guihob and the magnificent Tappiya        Waterfalls which has an enormous basin for swimming.\\nShopping takes a different twist in Banaue. While        souvenir items are offered by curio stores, the more        exciting way to shop, however, is to go on a village        visit, watch a family demonstrate their native craft and        then haggle for a better price on their product.\\nAwesome Hills\\nChocolate Hills is a series of 1,268 perfectly       symmetrical, haycock-shaped hills that rise some 30 meters       above the ground. A National Geologic Monument, these       unique, rock formations were cast after million years of       evolution.\\nSpread out in the towns of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan, the       hills are so-called because they resemble chocolate bonbons       when their grass cover turns to brown at the onset of       summer. Two of the hills have been developed and provided       with facilities, including a viewdeck, a youth hostel and a       restaurant.\\nOther hills with a commanding view of the surrounding       islands include Banat-I and Elly in the capital city of       Tagbilaran, Himontagon in the town of Loay, Sampoangan in       Calape and Ilihan in Jagna.\\nBarefoot in the Beach\\nThe code in Boracay is strictly informal.\\nThere is an undeniable easy atmosphere in Boracay where walking      barefoot than shod is the rule rather than the exception. White      Beach is so, soooo fine, it feels like treading on miles of baby      powder! No wonder, even swinging discos have the beach for a      floor, giving dance a new twist.\\nThere are no hang-ups either in this island. At daytime,      tourists having a soothing massage under the shade of a coconut      tree beside the shoreline is a common sight. And from dusk to      dawn, Boracay turns into one big party place where everyone is      welcome to join in…But first, let\\'s toast that sunset cocktail!\\nDiversions are certainly no problem in this tropical eden with      leisure activities calendared throughout the year and amenities      offered by some 350 tourist establishments.\\nThe Isle of Your Tropical Dreams\\nCebu is the traveler\\'s fantasy of a tropical island come       true - balmy weather, pristine beaches, crystalline waters,       and luxurious resorts with all the frills of modern living.\\nThe island-province of Cebu was where the Portuguese       navigator Ferdinand Magellan planted the Cross of       Christianity in the name of Spain in 1521. But even before       Cebu became the Occidental gateway to the Orient, it was       already a popular entry point among Asian merchants.\\nCebu has since blossomed into a choice tourist       destination, with many leisure establishments taking full       advantage of its sea-valley-and-mountain location.\\nMetropolitan Cebu, the country\\'s second biggest metropolis,       is the political, economic, educational and cultural center       of the Visayas. Hotels, shopping malls, entertainment halls,       casinos and golf fairways are ever present in the metro to       cater to every tourist\\'s whim.\\nThe rest of Cebu\\'s 166 islands and islets are fringed       with sandy beaches and sapphire-clear waters teeming with       marine life, perfect for divers.\\n\\xa0\\nLand of Plenty\\n\"Kadayawan sa Dabaw\" is Davao City\\'s premier festival and       showcases the natural and cultural bounty of the land.\\nA movable feast in August, the week-long merrymaking       highlights the manifold tribal cultures of the region which       are vividly expressed in traditional songs, dances, games       and crafts. It is also on this occasion when a lively trade       fair, capped by a flower-and-fruit float parade, takes       place. Street dancing and popular entertainment complete the       celebration.\\nAgriculture-based industries thrive in the Davao region. A       major exporter of bananas, citrus, mangosteen and other       tropical fruits, it is also the biggest producer of cultured       flowers in the country. Its surrounding waters are rich       sources for commercial fishing.\\nThe world\\'s largest city in terms of land area, Davao covers       all of 244,000 hectares.\\nManila\\nThe capital of the Philippines - its heart and soul -- is       Manila. It sets the rhythm of life in this archipelago and       is a pulsating hub that blends the Oriental with the       Occidental, the quaint with the modern, the mundane with the       extraordinary.\\nManila was born out of the ashes of a once flourishing       Malay settlement by the banks of the Pasig River. In 1571,       Miguel Lopez de Legazpi established the Ever Loyal City of       Manila which, until 1898, was the seat of Spanish colonial       rule in Asia. He built the city within walls and called it       Intramuros.\\nAn anchor tourist destination, Manila is the very core of       the 7,000 times more islands that make up the Philippines.       It is a center for the performing arts in Asia.\\nThe Last Frontier\\nUnique to Palawan is its megadiversity.\\nFor a long time, Palawan\\'s bountiful resources, abundant wildlife and    extraordinary natural beauty are known only to the many ethnic    communities that thrive in these islands and a few other daring settlers    who wanted to live in unpolluted surroundings.\\nThe island-province first attracted foreign attention in the 1970\\'s when    it became a United Nations Vietnamese Refugee Center. At this time, a    disturbance in Kenya also saw the transport of endangered animals from    its savannas to the plains of Calauit Island.\\nHowever, it was only a sea accident in 1979 that eventually led to the    opening of Palawan into tourism big time.\\nAs the story goes, a tuna line disabled a dive boat\\'s propeller in the    middle of the night forcing it to drop anchor in an inlet. The following    morning, the divers woke up to an amazing scenery of skyscraping dark    cliffs, thick green forest, white-sand beach, sparkling water and,    rising above it, a series of magnificently sculpted jade islands. And    thus was how El Nido was discovered.\\nEcology awareness is at a high level throughout the province. Puerto    Princesa prides itself as the cleanest city in the Philippines. To    protect its megadiversity, only eco-friendly programs are adhered to by    tourist establishments. And there are strict ordinances against dynamite    fishing, with only net and line fishing allowed.\\nPalawan may have opened itself to tourism but it has also taken serious    efforts to preserve this last frontier.\\nOld World City\\nVigan, with its centuries-old edifices, is a breathing       reminder of what was once a royal city.\\nOne of the earliest Spanish settlements in the country,       Vigan was founded in 1572 by Juan de Salcedo who patterned       its design to that of Intramuros (Old Manila). It became the       seat of the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia and was called       Ciudad Fernandina in honor of King Ferdinand.\\nToday, Vigan retains much of the patina of 18th century       Castillan architecture as seen in some 150 stone houses       which stand in the town\\'s Mestizo District, notably Mena       Crisologo Street. Many of these ancestral homes are still in       good condition and some have been turned into cozy inns,       museums, and souvenir shops.\\nAlong with the homes are other vestiges of the town\\'s       colonial past:\\nThe majestic St. Paul\\'s Cathedral was built by the       Augustinian friars along the distinct \"Earthquake Baroque\" style of the Ilocos region and features Neo-Gothic and       pseudo Romanesque motifs. Standing on an elevation west of       the cathedral is Plaza Salcedo, the oldest monument in       Northern Luzon. The Archbishop\\'s Palace is a rich repository       of religious artifacts from the Ilocos region. Plaza Burgos       was built in honor of Fr. Jose Burgos, one of three Filipino       priests who were garroted by the Spaniards for espousing       church reforms.\\nBut it is not only edifices which are preserved in this town       inscribed in the World Heritage List. Viganos also remain       steadfast in their traditional crafts, notably pottery       (burnay) and handloom weaving (inabel).\\nThe horse-drawn calesa (rig) is as much a presence in the       streets as motor vehicles.\\nCopyright © 2009\\n', 181]\n",

      "[7.265774429753495e-05, \"Last Laugh for the Philippines; Onetime Joke Economy Avoids Much of Asia's Turmoil\\nBy EDWARD A. GARGAN\\nContinue reading the main story\\nChristmas roars into the Philippines with sacks of red ribbons and plastic fir trees festooned in frosted and sequined glass bulbs. Streets are lathered in glowing stars, six-foot candles and light displays of Santa's sleigh dashing through the tropical humidity.\\nDetermined not to be left out, the central bank on Roxas Boulevard has draped its office block in a lighted display of its own: four mammoth line charts tracking the country's inflation, foreign exchange reserves, economic growth and the rate on 91-day Treasury bills.\\nMerry Christmas.\\nIndeed, in the Philippines, long regarded as a comedic, boisterously democratic laggard, the turmoil afflicting other Asian economies has left many people feeling a bit merrier than usual at this time of year. The thunder of collapsing banks and the cracking of economic hubris elsewhere are even making Filipinos a bit smug.\\nThe Philippines has been hit by a fall in its own currency and stock market in recent months, yet it has not experienced the more damaging banking and real estate chaos that has afflicted other countries in East Asia.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nUnlike Bangkok and Jakarta, where cranes stand frozen over dozens of abandoned building sites, Manila is a hive of construction; with occupancy rates in the business districts at 98 to 99 percent, the thirst for new buildings remains strong. And while Bangkok's projected light-rail line is just a procession of silent concrete pillars, workers swarm over the site of Manila's new overhead light-rail line, work that has turned one of the city's main arteries, Edsa Boulevard, into a monumental traffic jam.\\nContinue reading the main story\\nThe Philippines has proved the exception mainly because it has not tried to leap ahead as suddenly as its neighbors, taking a conservative tack at least partly mandated by the International Monetary Fund.\\n''There's a bit of truth to the case of the turtle and the hare,'' laughed Washington SyCip, the 75-year-old founder of SGV Group, the country's largest insurance conglomerate, and widely regarded as the dean of the country's financial sector. By moving slowly, he said, the nation did not ''make all the mistakes of our neighbors.''\\nForeign investors, rather than shying away in alarm, as they have elsewhere in the region, are still coming in. Acer, Taiwan's largest computer maker, is building a huge manufacturing center at Subic Bay. Intel, already the country's largest exporter, is expanding its production. And Seagate, an American maker of hard-disk drives, is planning to open a plant here.\\nIndeed, while countries across Asia, from Thailand to Indonesia to South Korea, are begging the I.M.F. to rescue them, the Philippines is toying with the notion of leaving I.M.F. supervision this month after 34 years, having successfully met the fund's targets for economic stability.\\n''We learned our lessons much earlier, and the past five years have been a time of resolute and pervasive correction and reform,'' President Fidel Ramos said during a visit to the United States last month. ''In the Philippines, we have felt the lash of the turmoil, although we have not been guilty of the mistakes'' made by other Asian countries.\\n''The Philippines,'' Mr. Ramos argued, ''has passed third base and is heading for home plate, meaning an exit from our I.M.F. program.''\\nIn a sense, it hardly matters whether Manila leaves fund supervision; the mere discussion of such a step sets the country apart from its neighbors and provides evidence of an economy distinctly better off than the savaged economies nearby.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\n[Indeed, the Philippine central bank announced on Wednesday that its economy is stable enough to allow it to cut its key overnight borrowing rate to 11 percent, the lowest level since the currency turmoil began sweeping through the region in July.]\\nIn some ways. to be sure, the Philippines has mimicked the problems that have sparked the Asian crisis. The peso has plunged nearly 30 percent in value, and the Manila stock market, perhaps because many outsiders fail to distinguish it from its neighbors, has tumbled about 35 percent since July.\\nBut the Philippines has resisted the impulse to erect the world's tallest building, to make a ''national'' car (while imposing high tariffs on competitors), to build a ''national'' airplane or to create a new capital. In short, it has eschewed the hubris that has infected many Asian tigers.\\n''We've gotten away from trying to devise a national car, or steel plant, or an aircraft industry,'' argued Victor S. Limlingan, a senior professor at the Asian Institute of Management, a leading business school. ''We have liberalized the economy. There are virtually no tariff protections. What's saving us is the liberalization program. Growth has spread out.''\\nDecades of I.M.F. supervision have, virtually all economists concur, set the country's economy firmly on rails leading to steady but unostentatious growth. In the last six years, under President Ramos, the Government has divested itself of everything from the national airline to electric power systems, banks to water supplies -- or is in the process of doing so. The Government's budget is in surplus, and sweeping reforms that would simplify the tax code while increasing revenues are on the brink of passage. And unlike Thailand, where banks are straining under a rate of bad loans over 20 percent, Philippine banks boast a rate of only 3.4 percent.\\nNewsletter Sign Up\\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\\nInvalid email address.

''Monetary policy wasn't too bold. And the structure of the economy is not like Thailand, for example, which borrowed huge amounts externally.''\\nMatthew S. Sutherland, head of Philippine research at Paribas Asia Equity, added: ''I don't think we have the systemic problems of the rest of Asia. The property sector is not overblown; banking is not in trouble; there has not been a lot of borrowing in U.S. dollars. We don't need three years of a tighter belt and severe austerity.''\\nAfter the collapse of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, a lot of the flagrant cronyism and corruption he nurtured died as well. And though corruption still exists, the privatization of much of the economy and an increasing openness in economic decision-making have wiped out a fair amount of the cronyism in business and government.\\nIn part, it is from the factories of people like Victoria Reyes that the Philippines is drawing its strength. From a desire to earn enough to carpet her house, Ms. Reyes built a large textile business, Remerco Garments Manufacturing Inc., which at its height employed more than 800 people. And all her production was exported.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nNorth and east of Manila, in Quezon City, in what used to be rice paddies and is now a warren of cement-block-walled factory compounds, Ms. Reyes and her children live and work on land that has been in the family for generations. Under a corrugated roof, with the walls open to the languid humidity of the tropics, 250 women hunch over Taiwan-made sewing machines churning out Chicago Bulls jackets, children's dresses, multicolored flannel jackets and denim children's pants.\\n''Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka are our big competitors,'' Ms. Reyes said. ''Of course China is big, too. In 1980, with China taking off, our European buyers dropped us like a sack of potatoes. But when they didn't get deliveries they came crawling back. I said no.'' In those days, the waning days of Marcos's martial law regime, days when the country's economy was stagnant, Ms. Reyes was one of the top 10 exporters in the Philippines.\\nA strike by workers in 1990 almost destroyed the business, and even Ms. Reyes acknowledged that she shared some blame. ''Our pride got the better of us,'' she confessed. But by 1995,  she was back, buoyed by the firm support of her two major American buyers and a Hong Kong garment house. Today, she said, ''it's a big small operation.''\\nThe operation is more efficient than ever. ''We're doing production levels we had with 600 people,'' she said. Still, as at all businesses in the Philippines, the falling peso and often usurious interest rates have required fast footwork. ''We had about a $1 million loan in pesos,'' explained her son, Rufino A. Reyes Jr., the company's vice president. ''Loan interest was 30 percent. It was too much for us to pay. I went to the bank and said I wanted to swap the peso loan to a dollar loan, since all our income is in dollars. So they did, and the interest rate is now 11 percent -- still high, but we can make it.''\\nWith $7 million to $8 million in sales, Remerco is relatively small next to the electronics giants -- electronics constitute about 51 percent of the total exports of the Philippines -- and competition remains fierce throughout the region. ''Right now we're banking on our long-term relationship with our buyers,'' Mr. Reyes said. ''But we have to be realistic that competition will be more.''\\nAnd with companies from Remerco to Intel expanding, Philippine exports have climbed more than 25 percent in the last year. Many analysts expect foreign and domestic investment to continue to grow.\\n''A lot is going on in industrial zones,'' said Jose Mario I. Cuyegkeng, research director at ING Baring Securities. ''And while we have one of the highest wages in the region, we have the higher productivity. Many people here speak English, and we have one of the cheapest middle-management salary structures anywhere.''\\nFor companies with domestic markets, things are likely to be tougher in the coming year. One tile maker, who insisted on anonymity, explained that with domestic business loan rates so high, he would have to put off his expansion plans for a while.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nThere are already signs that consumer spending is waning. The most recent data available indicate that sales of many larger items began to fall in July, particularly televisions, fans and washing machines.\\nEven so, Roberto C. Benares, who runs a small investment bank here, the Asian Alliance Investment Corporation, said that while he foresaw  more mergers and acquisitions as some companies faced difficulties (there have been almost no initial public offerings on the Manila exchange since July), he remained confident that the country's fundamentals and its corporate base were sound. ''If you look at the property groups, they're slowing down a bit,'' he said. ''But they will survive. The banking sector is going to be O.K. They have been through so many troughs, they're overcautious, unlike Thai banks. Everybody is still upbeat.''\\nMost frustrating, said Mr. SyCip of SGV, is the tendency of bankers and investors outside Asia to lump the region into one pot. ''All countries in the region do have problems,'' he said, ''but not serious enough for 50 percent declines in stock markets -- except for Thailand. Here, building is still going on. Our banking system is much more transparent. Our export figures are comfortably up, and a lot of plants are coming on line. It's a failure to distinguish one country from another.''\\n\", 8]\n",

      "[4.554620963403981e-05, 'Eleno O. Peralta [30]\\nABSTRACT\\nDeforestation has taken on alarming proportions in the Philippines during the post Second World War decades, and it is now among the six countries that account for three-quarters of recent deforestation in the region. The Philippine government has formulated the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) for 2001- 2004 of which a key component is the Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM), a national strategy in managing the forestlands resources and seeks to address the interlinked problem of forest destruction and upland poverty. While forestry research in the Philippines is handled principally by government research agencies, there are also non-governmental organizations (NGO) and academe-based research institutions that conduct various related researches. The Forestry Development Center (FDC) based at the College of Forestry and Natural Resources (CFNR) of the University of the Philippines at Los Baños, was established to conduct basic policy researches in forestry and develop, or help develop, an effective machinery for forestry policy formulation and implementation. In view of changing demands for research on poverty reduction, especially in the uplands, the research thrusts of FDC have shifted to focus on areas such as improvement of the socio-economic well-being of the upland farmers and harnessing forests for poverty eradication.\\nTHE PHILIPPINE FORESTRY SECTOR\\nThe Philippines has a total land area of slightly less than 30 million ha. From a high of 21 million ha in 1900 (70 percent of land area), the country\\'s forest cover was reduced to 5.5 million ha in 1999 (18.3 percent). Deforestation has taken on alarming proportions in the Philippines during the post Second World War decades. The scenario for 2010 has been described as \"nothing short of disastrous\" with the country\\'s forest cover reaching a low of 6.6 percent of the total land area.\\nThe UN Commission on Sustainable Development through the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF) identified the following causes: poverty, lack of secure land tenure patterns, inadequate recognition of the rights and needs of forest-dependent indigenous and local communities within national laws and jurisdiction, inadequate cross-sectoral policies, lack of participation, lack of good governance, absence of supportive economic climate that supports sustainable forest management, lack of capacity, among other factors. These are the same factors contributing to the massive destruction of the forests during the past two decades: the tremendous pressure from an increasing population in search of land; ever increasing demand of fuelwood; the over-exploitation of timber resources; and inadequate forest development, management and conservation efforts. Consequently, soil degradation due to massive conversion of forestlands and grasslands to urban use and increased cultivation in upland areas remains a big problem. It was estimated that 45 percent of the country\\'s total land area suffers from moderate to severe soil erosion, most of which is still unabated (MTPDP 2001- 2004).\\nMeanwhile, poor rural households have increased with the poverty incidence at a high 28.4 percent in 2000. This means that more than one-third of the country\\'s population is living below the poverty line (MTPDP 2001-2004). Aggravating the problem is the observation that rural income distribution has worsened with nearly 50 percent of rural income being accounted for by the upper one-fifth of rural households in 1997 (MIPDP 2001-2004).\\nTo remedy the above situation, the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) for 2001- 2004 intends to promote sustainable management and use of its natural resources. To achieve this goal, the government will use four key strategies: (a) environmental sustainability; (b) broader participation of stakeholders in the management and protection of natural resources and environment; (c) equitable access to productive resources and services; and (d) technology-based production in the forestry and natural resources sectors.\\nA key component of the MTPDP is the Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM), which is the national strategy in managing the forest resources and seeks to address the interlinked problem of forest destruction and upland poverty. Based on current estimates, there are about 20 million Filipinos living in the uplands most of which had been characterized to be of low forest cover. This is based on the concept of \"people first and sustainable forestry will follow\" wherein upland communities are empowered to directly manage and benefit from the forest resources entrusted to them. The hypothesis is that when the issues of poverty and inequitable access to resources in the uplands are addressed, local community itself will join hands in protecting and managing the forest because it has an important stake on the resources.\\nThe CBFM programme has the following objectives:\\nSustainable management of forest and resources\\nSocial justice and improved well-being of the local communities\\nStrong partnership among local communities and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).\\nThe DENR is the primary government agency responsible in the sustainable development of the country\\'s natural resources and ecosystems. In implementing the CBFM programme, the DENR is guided by the following essential features:\\nSecurity of tenure in the form of long-term tenure and usufructuary instruments\\nSocial equity by giving enough access to the natural endowments of the area, and internally through equitable benefit-sharing arrangements among the members of the people\\'s organizations\\nStrong partnership between the national government agency and the local government units to ensure local support to the programme.\\nInvestment capital and market linkages to sustain the increased economic conditions of the upland community without necessarily exhausting the natural resources in the area.\\nThese very recent developments bring into focus the role of research and development institutions in the Asia-Pacific region in supplying the relevant information and research results for a clear understanding of the sustainable forest resource management-poverty reduction nexus. This is very important particularly for low forest cover but high upland population countries like the Philippines where the challenge of the natural resources governance has always been to uplift the socio-economic well-being of the upland people and at the same time maintain the health of its environment and natural resources systems.\\nFORESTRY RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES\\nAt present, state-sponsored forestry research in the Philippines is handled principally by DENR through its Ecosystem Research and Development Bureau (ERDB), and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through the research consortia being coordinated by the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD).\\nAt the same time, there are non-governmental organizations (NGO) and academe-based research institutions that conduct various researches in support of their respected mandate. One of these academe-based research institutions is the Forestry Development Center (FDC), which is based at the College of Forestry and Natural Resources (CFNR), University of the Philippines, Los Baños, College, Laguna. The FDC was established under Presidential Decree No. 1559 issued in 1978 to conduct basic policy researches in forestry and develop, or help develop, an effective machinery for forestry policy formulation and implementation. Its objectives include:\\nGeneration of information/data on forestry related areas of concern\\nConduct of basic forest policy and related researches relevant to changing national priorities, goal and objectives\\nAdvocate policy reforms, which will enhance forestry development in particular and national development in general\\nPromote healthy discussion of policy reforms and critical development issues in forestry among sectors concerned.\\nPromote the publication and dissemination of forestry policy information.\\nIt employs three main approaches, namely:\\nPolicy research and studies in the following areas: social forestry, environmental forestry and biodiversity, sustainable forest resources development.\\nForums wherein the FDC facilitates free and open discussion and experience of ideas through seminars, symposiums, conference, workshop and round-table talks for deeper analyses of environmental policies and issues for further reforms.\\nInformation dissemination through publications such as policy papers, occasional papers, seminar/ workshop proceedings, bibliographies of forestry and environmental laws/regulations.\\nIn view of the changing demands for relevant research on poverty reduction programmes and strategies anchored on the natural endowments of the country, specifically in the uplands, research thrusts of the FDC and other academe-based research institutions will now have to focus on the following:\\nImpact studies of existing forestry programmes particularly on the improvement of the socio-economic well-being of the upland farmers - There must be a conscious effort to determine whether existing development programmes in the uplands are really giving significant benefits to the poor on a sustained basis. In this regard, the FDC has conducted a series of assessments of both the bio-physical and socio-institutional components of the country\\'s Community-Based Forest Management programme based on the targets agreed upon by the upland community and the government over a given area. This kind of research will disclose the impact of the development programme both on the forest and on the upland community. The data to be generated from this kind of research will be useful as cross-reference if indeed the country is on track with its commitment to reduce the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by at least one-half by 2015.\\nPolicy advocacy to push the adoption of relevant policies at all levels geared towards harnessing forests for poverty eradication in the uplands - An indispensable prerequisite to sustain the contribution of forests to the eradication of poverty in the uplands is the presence of enabling policy system. The research institution should therefore be concerned not only in the generation and interpretation of data but also in translating research results into hard policies, then be able to advocate for the formal adoption of these policies on a broader scale. This activity requires different expertise and methodology but remains a critical phase in the overall objective of establishing an enabling policy environment to eradicate poverty in the uplands using the forest resources. In the Philippines, the College of Forestry and Natural Resources, through the FDC, is very active in undertaking forest policy advocacy work. This is done by lobbying with lawmakers for the passage of laws affecting the natural resources sector, participating in important deliberations of proposed laws and even administrative issuance and submitting policy proposals for consideration of the policy makers.\\nCapacity building of upland community - There are plenty of researchers on new technologies that would improve crop yields both in terms of volume and quality. The challenge is to bring these technologies to the doorstep of the upland farmer so that he can use them in his farm. This is one role which research institutions should give equal importance because no matter how good the technology is on paper if it is not being employed for the benefit of the upland farmers, then it has no extrinsic value at all. Trainings and information and education campaigns must therefore become integral components of the research programme of R & D institutions to ensure that the results of their researches and studies are applied at the grassroots level. The research institution in effect acts as transferor of practical technology direct to the end users.\\nCoalition formation - Since sustainable forest management and poverty are both multi-dimensional in nature, R & D institutions should endeavour to join their efforts to take advantage of their respective talents, disciplinary strengths and resources. This strategy enables more integrated research programme among research institutions having complementary interests either on poverty eradication in the uplands or sustainable forest resource management. It will also strengthen the policy advocacy work designed towards the formal adoption of policy reforms resulting from researches and studies.\\nThe FDC is currently applying this approach in promoting the formal adoption of the Philippine Strategy for Improved Watershed Resources Management (PSIWRW). By convening an annual national watershed forum, almost all water-related agencies of the government, the private sector and civil society are gathered round the table. In the process, albeit informally, a coalition could be formed composed of these water-related agencies and institutions that could be mobilized for a concerted action in the future. In similar fashion, all the major agencies and institutions concerned with poverty eradication and sustainable forest resources management could organize themselves into a coalition that will advance their common objective of eradicating poverty through the sustainable management of forest resources.\\nLaying the scientific basis for policy making - Policy-makers rely much on empirical evidence to support their policy initiatives. Oftentimes though, this relationship is missing such that research institutions continue to undertake research for the sake of research. At the other end, policy initiatives lack a solid foundation because these are not backed up by scientific data resulting in policy stalemate. Given this common situation in the Philippines and perhaps in many developing countries, academe-based research institutions could employ a proactive stance by configuring their research programmes along the country\\'s macro-development plans and national policy agenda on poverty eradication and sustainable forest resources management. The finding of these aligned researches and studies would then be immensely relevant and valuable to the policy process of the government. In essence, the research institutions act as clearing house for information processing in support of policy making.\\nFor example, although nobody will argue the need to eradicate poverty in the uplands and at the same time, sustainably manage the forest resources there, the scientific predicate that would articulate the specifics of this relationship may not yet be ready. As a result, the passage of policies that would capture the ramifications of sustainable forest resource management and poverty eradication in the uplands could not catch the imagination of the public. This is the case in the Philippines where the country\\'s main forest policy is already about 27 years old and amendments tabled remains pending for many reasons. One of which is the lack of snowballed public clamour towards approval. This lack of public support could be a function of the inability of the country\\'s research institutions to articulate with conviction the scientific foundation of the pending amendments.\\nDeconstruct conventional theories on the environment-poverty nexus - The research institutions should now look more closely at the validity of conventional theories surrounding the so-called environment-poverty nexus. For a long time, the tenet is that population growth will lead to environmental degradation because of poverty. This is unfairly blaming the upland farmers for the sorry state of the uplands. There is a need to review those conventional assumptions and come up with new ideas on how to solve the problem of poverty in the uplands. For example, in the CBFM programme that is being assessed by the FDC, one of the areas where the researchers are interested in relates to the non-forest-based employment opportunities of the upland farmers. The idea is to determine if the uplifting of at least the economic status of the upland farmers could be successfully detached from the forest resources existing in the area. If this is possible then the twin objectives of forest protection and economic growth in the upland community could be achieved through the programme.\\nProvide empirical evidence towards the design of academic programmes built on the philosophy that integrates poverty eradication and forest conservation - It is high time that poverty eradication and forest conservation is placed in the centre of academic discussion so that future practitioners will be equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and right attitude towards this human endeavour. Research institutions could immensely help influence the development of this kind of academic programmes owing to their rich database on the intimate link between poverty and natural resources and the consequent dynamics that emerge from this interaction. The advantage of academe-based research institutions is that they are organized and working within an academic community and this set-up gives them access to the planning and revision of academic programmes. Furthermore, the researchers are frequently seconded to teach or guide graduate studies and this gives these researchers adequate opportunities to convey the results of their researches to the faculty and students.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn its policy brief entitled \"How forests can reduce poverty\", the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) presented an agenda for action composed of four major components on how trees, forests and forestry can contribute towards increasing food security and reducing poverty:\\nStrengthening rights, capabilities and governance - This component requires three strategies, namely: (a) support the poor\\'s own decision-making power; (b) strengthen forest rights of the poor and the means to claim them; and (c) recognize links between forestry and local governance.\\nReducing vulnerability - This is achieved by: (a) make safely nets not poverty traps; (b) support tree planting outside forests; (c) cut the regulatory burden on the poor and make regulation affordable; and (d) reduce unfair obligations in forest management.\\nCapturing emerging opportunities - This involves four key strategies: (a) remove the barriers to market entry; (b) base land use decisions on true value of forests; (c) ensure that markets for environmental services benefit the poor; and (d) support associations and financing for local forest businesses.\\nWorking in partnership - Strategies under this component are: (a) simplify policies and support participatory processes; (b) promote multisectoral learning and action; (c) enhance interagency collaboration and (d) make NGOs and the private sector partners in poverty reduction.\\nThis four-point agenda for action presents a very good opportunity for academe-based research institutions to give a significant contribution to the global programme of poverty eradication using forest resources. Each of the strategies identified in this four-point agenda for action is a critical research area wherein academe-based institutions could innovate and seek their changed roles. As stressed in the World Development Report 2003, of the many interrelated drivers of socio-economic change and transformation, scientific and technological innovation is the first. Logically therefore, research institutions should be at the forefront in finding ways and means of combating poverty in the uplands.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\nAnonymous. 1978.

Esto se refleja en la ausencia                  de instituciones geriátricas, dedicadas al cuidado de personas mayores.\\nCultura\\nLas artes como la música formaban parte de la vida pre-hispánica            en Filipinas. Los instrumentos musicales como la flauta y la guitarra de            bambú y el gong, eran utilizados en épocas que datan del año 500. Existían            también canciones indígenas para las distintas fases de la vida - el nacimiento,            la infancia, el noviazgo, el matrimonio y la muerte. La pintura, en especial sobre el cuerpo           humano, se practicaba también. Las primeras personas encontradas por Magallanes y su            tripulación eran indígenas con tatuajes que llamaron \"pintados\".\\nLos primeros exploradores y cronistas españoles se sorprendieron cuando se enteraron que           la escritura ya estaba desarrollada en muchas partes del archipiélago y que muchos indígenas            eran alfabetos. Las primeras escrituras estaban probablemente hechas en materiales perecederos            tales como las hojas y las cortezas de los árboles así que los investigadores y los antropólogos            no pudieron determinar con exactitud cuando fueron realizadas las primeras escrituras en el país.           Creen que podría haber sido desarrollada entre 200 años AC y 1.200 DC, inicialmente para anotar            transacciones comerciales y posteriormente para apuntar canciones, cuentos populares,            poesía y otras formas de la literatura.\\nDiversidad de culturas en el país\\nLa existencia de un variado número de diferentes idiomas, dialectos y de tradiciones religiosas ha hecho que los filipinos no hayan desarrollado una única cultura nacional. Durante muchos siglos, la evolución de la historia cultural de Filipinas ha tenido una naturaleza local, enriquecida con influencias de China, Malaysia, España y Estados Unidos. Los elementos populares indígenas encontraron expresión en la literatura y en la música, así como en otras formas culturales. Entre los deportes tradicionales se encuentran el arnis, un tipo de esgrima con palos de madera, y el sipa, un juego muy parecido al voleibol, excepto en que los jugadores usan tanto los pies como sus manos y brazos. Las peleas de gallos y el boxeo son muy populares y la influencia cultural estadounidense se aprecia en la popularidad del béisbol y del baloncesto.\\nUna de las características más notables de la sociedad filipina es la tradición de una fuerte fidelidad familiar. Esto se refleja en la ausencia de instituciones geriátricas, dedicadas a acoger a las personas mayores, y de orfanatos. Desde la época precolonial, las mujeres filipinas tenían elevadas posiciones en la sociedad y, en la actualidad, continúan desempeñando importantes cargos en la vida económica, social y política.\\nAdemás de las bibliotecas universitarias, las principales bibliotecas del país son la Biblioteca de la Ciudad de Manila, la Biblioteca Nacional y la biblioteca del Instituto de la Ciencia y de Información Tecnológica, todas en Manila. El Museo y la Biblioteca Memorial López, en Pasay, tienen colecciones de pinturas de los principales artistas filipinos, así como las cartas y manuscritos del escritor y patriota José Rizal.\\nEl Museo de Santo Tomás, en Manila, tiene las colecciones arqueológicas y de historia natural más destacadas, que ilustran la historia de las islas. El Museo Nacional, en Manila, tiene divisiones de antropología, botánica, geología y zoología, junto a colecciones de arte y un planetario.\\nLa literatura filipina anterior a la llegada de los españoles consistía en historias populares de transmisión oral y proverbios que circulaban en los diversos dialectos de las islas. La literatura bajo la influencia española fue en un principio poética y religiosa y se desarrolló posteriormente bajo la influencia estadounidense hacia la narrativa y el teatro. Entre los escritores de Filipinas se encuentran el novelista José Rizal, Francisco Balagtas, poeta y filósofo, José García Villa, poeta y uno de los escritores más destacados en narrativa corta, Carlos P. Rómulo, periodista y diplomático, el poeta y dramaturgo Claro Recto, el poeta, novelista y dramaturgo Nick Joaquín, y Pas Marques Benitz, un escritor de narrativa corta.\\nEl kundiman, una combinación de palabras y música, es único en las islas. Entre los músicos de fama de Filipinas destacan Rodolfo Cornejo, compositor y director musical, Antonino Buenaventura, director musical, y Antonio J. Molina, director musical y compositor. Los bailes populares son también destacados y hay muchos bailes ceremoniales y tradicionales para diferentes ocasiones.\\nLas artes y la música\\nLos filipinos estuvieron expuestos a las artes y la música europea con la introducción del violín,            el piano, el arpa, la guitarra y otros instrumentos. El órgano de bambú en Las Piñas,            construido en 1.818, forma parte del legado de la música filipina durante la época colonial.           Los bailes populares mexicanos como la polca, la jota y el rigodón influyeron en la danza           nativa filipina.\\nCalendario gregoriano\\nFueron los españoles que sincronizaron el calendario filipino con el resto del mundo a través de            la introducción del calendario gregoriano en 1844.\\n', 16]\n",

Each barkada is either all male or all female. Members develop their own slang and go almost everywhere together.\\nThe country's most popular sport is basketball; in 1954, the country was placed third in the World Basketball Championship. Men and boys play the game in school gyms and neighbourhood streets. Filipino players have excelled at the sport and become the top players in Asia. Crowds flock to watch professional teams compete in the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Filipinos have also excelled at boxing, with athletes winning international competitions. Flyweight boxer Mansuetto Onyok Velasco took a silver medal at the 1996 Olympics.\\nA common form of handball, jai alai, has recently declined in popularity and been banned at the professional level due to gambling. In the game, players bounce a hard rubber ball off one end of a court and catch the ball in a small basket (cesta) tied to their hand. Sipa, popular with adults and children, is a type of volleyball that uses a rattan ball; players must drive the ball over a net using only their legs, body and feet. In the martial art of arnis de mano, invented by a Filipino, competitors fight with rattan sticks. People also enjoy bowling.\\nFilipinos enthusiastic about games such mahjongg, a Chinese game played with 144 tiles. Chess, checkers, dama (a type of draughts) and dominos are also very popular and often played on street corners. In 1992, the Philippines hosted the World Chess Olympics; the country has many top players, including grandmasters Eugenio Torre and Rosendo Balinas Jr. The most popular form of entertainment among men, however, is cockfighting. Virtually every town has a cockpit, which is jammed on weekends and holidays with spectators betting on the fights.\\nGiven the country's many beaches, Sunday beach picnics are a popular pastime for families. Wealthier Filipinos and tourists also enjoy yachting, diving and sailing.\\n\\xa0\\xa0Did you know?\\nKali, a martial art indigenous to the Philippines, was originally developed for defense and partly based on skill with a wavy-edged sword. According to legend, when Ferdinand Magellan, the first Spanish visitor, arrived in 1524, he was opposed by islanders using kali swords and killed by their leader, Lapu Lapu-now considered a folk hero. Modern kali practitioners use weapons such as sticks and knives.\\n\", 28]\n",

      "[0.0006315226517789029, 'Source: Philippine Statistics Authority [3]\\nEthnologue lists 186 individual languages in the Philippines, 182 of which are living languages, while 4 no longer have any known speakers. Most native languages are part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages , which is itself a branch of the Austronesian language family . [410] The only language not classified as an Austronesian language is Chavacano which is a creole language of Mexican-Spanish and is classified as a Romance language . [425]\\nFilipino and English are the official languages of the country. [12] Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog , spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English are used in government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides for the promotion of Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. [12] Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. [426] However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages. [427]\\nNineteen regional languages act as auxiliary official languages used as mediums of instruction: Aklanon , Bikol , Cebuano , Chavacano , Hiligaynon , Ibanag , Ilocano , Ivatan , Kapampangan , Kinaray-a , Maguindanao , Maranao , Pangasinan , Sambal , Surigaonon , Tagalog, Tausug , Waray , and Yakan . [2] Other indigenous languages such as, Cuyonon , Ifugao , Itbayat , Kalinga , Kamayo , Kankanaey , Masbateño , Romblomanon , Malay , and several Visayan languages are prevalent in their respective provinces. [428]\\nLanguages not indigenous to the islands are also taught in select schools. Mandarin is used in Chinese schools catering to the Chinese Filipino community. Islamic schools in Mindanao teach Modern Standard Arabic in their curriculum. [429] French , German , Japanese , Korean , and Spanish are taught with the help of foreign linguistic institutions. [430] The Department of Education began teaching the Malay languages of Indonesian and Malaysian in 2013. [431]\\nReligion\\nMain article: Religion in the Philippines\\nLoay Church\\nThe Philippines is an officially secular state , although Christianity is the dominant faith. [432] Census data from 2010 found that about 80.58% of the population professed Catholicism . [4] Around 37% regularly attend Mass and 29% identify as very religious. [433] [434] Protestants are 10.8% [435] [436] of the total population, mostly endorsing Evangelical Protestant denominations that were introduced by American missionaries at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, they are heavily concentrated in Northern Luzon and Southern Mindanao. [437] [438] The Philippine Independent Church is a notable independent Catholic denomination. [439] [440] [441] Iglesia ni Cristo is a notable Restorationist denomination in the country. [442] [443]\\nIslam is the second largest religion. The Muslim population of the Philippines was reported as 5.57% of the total population according to census returns in 2010, [4] although a 2012 report by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos estimates it at 11%. [444] The majority of Muslims live in the Bangsamoro region . [445] [446] [447] [448] Most practice Sunni Islam under the Shafi\\'i school . [449] [450]\\nAn unknown number of Filipinos are irreligious , but they may form as much as 10% of the population. [451] [452] Catholicism\\'s historic dominance is steadily declining, with about 9% of adherents considering leaving their church. [453]\\nAn estimated 2% of the total population practice Philippine traditional religions , whose practices and folk beliefs are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam. [443] [454] Buddhism is practiced by around 2% of the population, and is concentrated among Filipinos of Chinese descent. [443] [449] [454] The remaining population is divided between a number of religious groups, including Hindus , Jews , and Baha\\'is . [455]\\nHealth\\nThe façade of the Bonifacio Global City branch of St. Luke\\'s Medical Center\\nThere are an increasing number of private health providers and, as of 2009 [update] , 67.1% of healthcare came from private expenditures while 32.9% was from government. In 2013, total expenditures on the health sector was 3.8% of GDP, below the WHO target of 5%. [456] Health expenditure represented about 6.1% of total government spending. Per capita total expenditure at average exchange rate was USD52. [457] The budget allocation for Healthcare in 2010 was ₱28\\xa0billion (about USD597\\xa0million) or ₱310 ($7) per person [458] but had an increase in budget in 2014 with a record high in the collection of taxes from the House Bill 5727 (commonly known as Sin tax Bill). [459]\\nThere are an estimated 90,370 physicians or 1 per every 833 people, 480,910 nurses, 43,220 dentists, and 1 hospital bed per every 769 people. [457] Retention of skilled practitioners is a problem. 70% of nursing graduates go overseas to work. The Philippines is the biggest supplier of nurses for export. [460]\\nIn 2001 there were about 1,700 hospitals , of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private. Cardiovascular diseases account for more than 25% of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite the increase of HIV/AIDS cases from 12,000 in 2005 [461] to 17,450 as of April 2014 with 5,965 people who were under anti-retroviral therapy, [462] the country is still a low-HIV-prevalence country with less than 0.1% of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive. [463]\\nEducation\\nMain article: Education in the Philippines\\nThe University of Santo Tomas , established in 1611, has the oldest extant university charter in Asia.\\nThe Philippines has a simple literacy rate of 95.6%, with 95.1% for males and 96.1% for females. The Philippines had a functional literacy rate of 86.45%, with 84.2% for males and 88.7% for females in 2008. [464] [465] Spending on education accounted for 16.11% in the national budget proposed for 2015. [466] [467]\\nThe Commission on Higher Education (CHED) lists 2,180 higher education institutions, 607 of which are public and 1,573 private. [468] Classes start in June and end in March. The majority of colleges and universities follow a semester calendar from June to October and November to March. There are a number of foreign schools with study programs. [218] A 6-year elementary and 4-year high school education is mandatory [469] with an additional two years being added in 2013. [470] [471]\\nSeveral government agencies are involved with education. The Department of Education covers elementary, secondary, and non-formal education. The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) administers post-secondary, middle-level education training and development. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) supervises college and graduate academic programs and degrees as well as regulates standards in higher education. [472]\\nIn 2004, madaris were mainstreamed in 16 regions nationwide, mainly in Muslim areas in Mindanao under the auspices and program of the Department of Education. [473] Public universities are all non-sectarian entities, and are further classified as State Universities and Colleges (SUC) or Local Colleges and Universities (LCU). [468] The University of the Philippines , a system of eight (8) constituent universities, is the national university system of the Philippines. [474]\\nCulture\\nA participant of the Ati-Atihan Festival .\\nPhilippine culture is a combination of Eastern and Western cultures . The Philippines exhibits aspects found in other Asian countries with a Malay [475] heritage, yet its culture also displays a significant number of Spanish and American influences. Traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas (district festivals) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common, these community celebrations are times for feasting, music, and dancing. The Ati-Atihan , Moriones and Sinulog festivals are a couple of the most well-known.\\nSome traditions, however, are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization. The Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the Philippines. They are famed for their iconic performances of Philippine dances such as the tinikling and singkil that both feature clashing bamboo poles. [476]\\nOne of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua , which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population. [477] The names of many streets, towns, and provinces are also in Spanish.\\nThe common use of the English language is an example of the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends. This affinity is seen in Filipinos\\' love of fast food and American film and music. Fast food outlets are found on many street corners. American global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market, but local fast food chains like Goldilocks and most notably Jollibee , the leading fast food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals. [478] [479]\\nArchitecture\\nMain article: Architecture of the Philippines\\nColonial houses in Vigan .\\nSpanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor, but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II. [58] Some examples remain, mainly among the country\\'s churches, government buildings, and universities. Four Philippine baroque churches are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the San Agustín Church in Manila, Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte , Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (Santa María) Church in Ilocos Sur , and Santo Tomás de Villanueva Church in Iloilo . [480] Vigan in Ilocos Sur is also known for the many Hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there. [481]\\nThe American occupation in 1898 introduced a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila . Part of the Burnham\\'s plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture . [482] In Iloilo , a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American occupation in the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real . [483]\\nHowever, certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate. Limestones and coral were used as building materials. [484] Idjangs or Ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the Spanish conquest of the whole Philippines. [485]\\nMusic\\nMain articles: Music of the Philippines and Original Pilipino Music\\nPercussion instruments that make up the Philippine kulintang ensemble, an example of pre-Hispanic musical tradition\\nPhilippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. Some examples of this tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T\\'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao . This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang .\\nDuring the Spanish era Rondalya music, where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals. [486]\\nMarcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) were some of the recognized musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. [487] [488] However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers . [489]\\nDance\\nTinikling dancers.\\nJust like the evolution of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga .\\nUniversal dances in the Philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals, mimicry, life cycle and parties. During the Spanish era, most dances are accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well.\\nOne famous dance that is well known is called the Tinikling , where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles. It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about \"How rural townsfolk mingle\". The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides. The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the Singkil . [490] Nowadays, in the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few. [491]\\nVisual art\\nThe Spoliarium (1884) by Juan Luna .\\nPottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5\\xa0BC to 225\\xa0AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods. [492] [493]\\nEarly Philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu . The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos\\' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery. [494]\\nPaintings of early modernist painters such as Damián Domingo often still had a religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.\\nIn the modern period, the integration of architecture in the Art Deco style happened. Many of these examples can be seen in statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces. [495]\\nValues\\nFurther information: Filipino values\\nAs a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity ), and commercial relationships. [496]\\nFilipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. [497] The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of \"Hiya\", roughly translated as \\'a sense of shame\\', and \"Amor propio\" or \\'self-esteem\\'. [497] Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos. [498]\\nOther elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery. [499]\\nCuisine\\nLeft-to-right: Lumpia , Adobo , Halo-halo and Sisig .\\nFilipino cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic , Chinese , American , and other Asian influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas. [479] [500]\\nPopular dishes include lechón , adobo , sinigang , kare-kare , tapa , crispy pata , pancit , lumpia , and halo-halo . Some common local ingredients used in cooking are calamansi , coconuts, saba (a kind of short wide plantain ), mangoes , ube , milkfish , and fish sauce . Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors. [479] [500]\\nUnlike many of their Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork. [501]\\nThe traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan (using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth) [502] was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas. [503] However, due to the various Filipino restaurants that introduced Filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to Filipino urbanites, kamayan fast became popular. This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the \"Boodle Fight\" concept (as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army), wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and Filipino viands are placed all together for a filial, friendly and/or communal kamayan feasting. [504]\\nLiterature\\nJosé Rizal is a pioneer of Philippine Revolution through his literary works.\\nPhilippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people. While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the aswang , the manananggal , the diwata / engkanto , and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling , Lam-Ang , and the Sarimanok . [505]\\nPhilippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English. Some of the most known were created from the 17th to 19th\\xa0century. Adarna , for example, is a famous epic about an eponymous magical bird allegedly written by José de la Cruz or \"Huseng Sisiw\". [506] Francisco Balagtas , the poet and playwright who wrote Florante at Laura , is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language. José Rizal wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Filibustering, also known as The Reign of Greed). He is considered a national hero. [507] His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule, and his death by firing squad, inspired other Filipino revolutionaries to seek independence. [508] Several Filipino writers were awarded National Artist of the Philippines such as N. V. M. Gonzalez , Amado V. Hernandez , Francisco Arcellana , Nick Joaquín , F. Sionil José and many more.\\nMedia\\nMain articles: Television in the Philippines , Radio in the Philippines , and Philippine drama\\nPhilippine media uses mainly Filipino and English. Other Philippine languages, including various Visayan languages are also used, especially in radio due to its ability to reach remote rural locations that might otherwise not be serviced by other kinds of media. The dominant television networks ABS-CBN , GMA and TV5 also have extensive radio presence. [509]\\nThe entertainment industry is vibrant and feeds broadsheets and tabloids with an unending supply of details about celebrities and sensationalist daily scandals. Drama and fantasy shows are anticipated as are Latin telenovelas , Asianovelas , and anime . Daytime television is dominated by game shows, variety shows, and talk shows such as Eat Bulaga and It\\'s Showtime . [510] Philippine cinema has a long history and is popular domestically, but has faced increasing competition from American , Asian and European films . Critically acclaimed directors and actors include Lino Brocka and Nora Aunor for films like Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag (Manila: In the Claws of Light) and Himala (Miracle). [511] [512] [513] [514] In recent years it has become common to see celebrities flitting between television and movies and then moving into politics provoking concerns. [515]\\nCinema\\nMain article: Cinema of the Philippines\\nBrillante Mendoza is a prominent Filipino film director.\\nSalón de Pertierra was the first introduced moving picture on January 1, 1897 in the Philippines. All films were all in Spanish since Philippine cinema was first introduced during the final years of the Spanish era of the country. Antonio Ramos was the first known movie producer. He used the Lumiere Cinematograph when he filmed Panorama de Manila (Manila landscape), Fiesta de Quiapo (Quiapo Fiesta), Puente de España (Bridge of Spain), and Escenas Callejeras (Street scenes). Meanwhile, Jose Nepomuceno was dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\". [516] Dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\", his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines. [517] His first film produced was entitled Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden) in 1919.\\nFilm showing resumed in 1900 during the American period . Walgrah, a British entrepreneur, opened the Cine Walgrah at No. 60 Calle Santa Rosa in Intramuros . It was also during this time that a movie market was formally created in the country along with the arrival of silent movies. These silent films were always accompanied by gramophone, a piano, a quartet, or a 200-man choir. During the Japanese occupation , filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of Philippine cinema with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures.\\nDuring the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft porn) pictures and an era of musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. [518] The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry. [519] In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.

The Philippine constitution provides for the promotion of Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. [12] Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. [426] However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages. [427]\\nNineteen regional languages act as auxiliary official languages used as mediums of instruction: Aklanon , Bikol , Cebuano , Chavacano , Hiligaynon , Ibanag , Ilocano , Ivatan , Kapampangan , Kinaray-a , Maguindanao , Maranao , Pangasinan , Sambal , Surigaonon , Tagalog, Tausug , Waray , and Yakan . [2] Other indigenous languages such as, Cuyonon , Ifugao , Itbayat , Kalinga , Kamayo , Kankanaey , Masbateño , Romblomanon , Malay , and several Visayan languages are prevalent in their respective provinces. [428]\\nLanguages not indigenous to the islands are also taught in select schools. Mandarin is used in Chinese schools catering to the Chinese Filipino community. Islamic schools in Mindanao teach Modern Standard Arabic in their curriculum. [429] French , German , Japanese , Korean , and Spanish are taught with the help of foreign linguistic institutions. [430] The Department of Education began teaching the Malay languages of Indonesian and Malaysian in 2013. [431]\\nReligion\\nMain article: Religion in the Philippines\\nLoay Church\\nThe Philippines is an officially secular state , although Christianity is the dominant faith. [432] Census data from 2010 found that about 80.58% of the population professed Catholicism . [4] Around 37% regularly attend Mass and 29% identify as very religious. [433] [434] Protestants are 10.8% [435] [436] of the total population, mostly endorsing Evangelical Protestant denominations that were introduced by American missionaries at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, they are heavily concentrated in Northern Luzon and Southern Mindanao. [437] [438] The Philippine Independent Church is a notable independent Catholic denomination. [439] [440] [441] Iglesia ni Cristo is a notable Restorationist denomination in the country. [442] [443]\\nIslam is the second largest religion. The Muslim population of the Philippines was reported as 5.57% of the total population according to census returns in 2010, [4] although a 2012 report by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos estimates it at 11%. [444] The majority of Muslims live in the Bangsamoro region . [445] [446] [447] [448] Most practice Sunni Islam under the Shafi\\'i school . [449] [450]\\nAn unknown number of Filipinos are irreligious , but they may form as much as 10% of the population. [451] [452] Catholicism\\'s historic dominance is steadily declining, with about 9% of adherents considering leaving their church. [453]\\nAn estimated 2% of the total population practice Philippine traditional religions , whose practices and folk beliefs are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam. [443] [454] Buddhism is practiced by around 2% of the population, and is concentrated among Filipinos of Chinese descent. [443] [449] [454] The remaining population is divided between a number of religious groups, including Hindus , Jews , and Baha\\'is . [455]\\nHealth\\nThe façade of the Bonifacio Global City branch of St. Luke\\'s Medical Center\\nThere are an increasing number of private health providers and, as of 2009 [update] , 67.1% of healthcare came from private expenditures while 32.9% was from government. In 2013, total expenditures on the health sector was 3.8% of GDP, below the WHO target of 5%. [456] Health expenditure represented about 6.1% of total government spending. Per capita total expenditure at average exchange rate was USD52. [457] The budget allocation for Healthcare in 2010 was ₱28\\xa0billion (about USD597\\xa0million) or ₱310 ($7) per person [458] but had an increase in budget in 2014 with a record high in the collection of taxes from the House Bill 5727 (commonly known as Sin tax Bill). [459]\\nThere are an estimated 90,370 physicians or 1 per every 833 people, 480,910 nurses, 43,220 dentists, and 1 hospital bed per every 769 people. [457] Retention of skilled practitioners is a problem. 70% of nursing graduates go overseas to work. The Philippines is the biggest supplier of nurses for export. [460]\\nIn 2001 there were about 1,700 hospitals , of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private. Cardiovascular diseases account for more than 25% of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite the increase of HIV/AIDS cases from 12,000 in 2005 [461] to 17,450 as of April 2014 with 5,965 people who were under anti-retroviral therapy, [462] the country is still a low-HIV-prevalence country with less than 0.1% of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive. [463]\\nEducation\\nMain article: Education in the Philippines\\nThe University of Santo Tomas , established in 1611, has the oldest extant university charter in Asia.\\nThe Philippines has a simple literacy rate of 95.6%, with 95.1% for males and 96.1% for females. The Philippines had a functional literacy rate of 86.45%, with 84.2% for males and 88.7% for females in 2008. [464] [465] Spending on education accounted for 16.11% in the national budget proposed for 2015. [466] [467]\\nThe Commission on Higher Education (CHED) lists 2,180 higher education institutions, 607 of which are public and 1,573 private. [468] Classes start in June and end in March. The majority of colleges and universities follow a semester calendar from June to October and November to March. There are a number of foreign schools with study programs. [218] A 6-year elementary and 4-year high school education is mandatory [469] with an additional two years being added in 2013. [470] [471]\\nSeveral government agencies are involved with education. The Department of Education covers elementary, secondary, and non-formal education. The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) administers post-secondary, middle-level education training and development. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) supervises college and graduate academic programs and degrees as well as regulates standards in higher education. [472]\\nIn 2004, madaris were mainstreamed in 16 regions nationwide, mainly in Muslim areas in Mindanao under the auspices and program of the Department of Education. [473] Public universities are all non-sectarian entities, and are further classified as State Universities and Colleges (SUC) or Local Colleges and Universities (LCU). [468] The University of the Philippines , a system of eight (8) constituent universities, is the national university system of the Philippines. [474]\\nCulture\\nA participant of the Ati-Atihan Festival .\\nPhilippine culture is a combination of Eastern and Western cultures . The Philippines exhibits aspects found in other Asian countries with a Malay [475] heritage, yet its culture also displays a significant number of Spanish and American influences. Traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas (district festivals) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common, these community celebrations are times for feasting, music, and dancing. The Ati-Atihan , Moriones and Sinulog festivals are a couple of the most well-known.\\nSome traditions, however, are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization. The Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the Philippines. They are famed for their iconic performances of Philippine dances such as the tinikling and singkil that both feature clashing bamboo poles. [476]\\nOne of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua , which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population. [477] The names of many streets, towns, and provinces are also in Spanish.\\nThe common use of the English language is an example of the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends. This affinity is seen in Filipinos\\' love of fast food and American film and music. Fast food outlets are found on many street corners. American global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market, but local fast food chains like Goldilocks and most notably Jollibee , the leading fast food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals. [478] [479]\\nArchitecture\\nMain article: Architecture of the Philippines\\nColonial houses in Vigan .\\nSpanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor, but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II. [58] Some examples remain, mainly among the country\\'s churches, government buildings, and universities. Four Philippine baroque churches are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the San Agustín Church in Manila, Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte , Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (Santa María) Church in Ilocos Sur , and Santo Tomás de Villanueva Church in Iloilo . [480] Vigan in Ilocos Sur is also known for the many Hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there. [481]\\nThe American occupation in 1898 introduced a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila . Part of the Burnham\\'s plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture . [482] In Iloilo , a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American occupation in the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real . [483]\\nHowever, certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate. Limestones and coral were used as building materials. [484] Idjangs or Ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the Spanish conquest of the whole Philippines. [485]\\nMusic\\nMain articles: Music of the Philippines and Original Pilipino Music\\nPercussion instruments that make up the Philippine kulintang ensemble, an example of pre-Hispanic musical tradition\\nPhilippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. Some examples of this tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T\\'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao . This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang .\\nDuring the Spanish era Rondalya music, where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals. [486]\\nMarcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) were some of the recognized musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. [487] [488] However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers . [489]\\nDance\\nTinikling dancers.\\nJust like the evolution of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga .\\nUniversal dances in the Philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals, mimicry, life cycle and parties. During the Spanish era, most dances are accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well.\\nOne famous dance that is well known is called the Tinikling , where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles. It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about \"How rural townsfolk mingle\". The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides. The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the Singkil . [490] Nowadays, in the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few. [491]\\nVisual art\\nThe Spoliarium (1884) by Juan Luna .\\nPottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5\\xa0BC to 225\\xa0AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods. [492] [493]\\nEarly Philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu . The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos\\' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery. [494]\\nPaintings of early modernist painters such as Damián Domingo often still had a religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.\\nIn the modern period, the integration of architecture in the Art Deco style happened. Many of these examples can be seen in statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces. [495]\\nValues\\nFurther information: Filipino values\\nAs a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity ), and commercial relationships. [496]\\nFilipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. [497] The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of \"Hiya\", roughly translated as \\'a sense of shame\\', and \"Amor propio\" or \\'self-esteem\\'. [497] Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos. [498]\\nOther elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery. [499]\\nCuisine\\nLeft-to-right: Lumpia , Adobo , Halo-halo and Sisig .\\nFilipino cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic , Chinese , American , and other Asian influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas. [479] [500]\\nPopular dishes include lechón , adobo , sinigang , kare-kare , tapa , crispy pata , pancit , lumpia , and halo-halo . Some common local ingredients used in cooking are calamansi , coconuts, saba (a kind of short wide plantain ), mangoes , ube , milkfish , and fish sauce . Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors. [479] [500]\\nUnlike many of their Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork. [501]\\nThe traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan (using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth) [502] was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas. [503] However, due to the various Filipino restaurants that introduced Filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to Filipino urbanites, kamayan fast became popular. This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the \"Boodle Fight\" concept (as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army), wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and Filipino viands are placed all together for a filial, friendly and/or communal kamayan feasting. [504]\\nLiterature\\nJosé Rizal is a pioneer of Philippine Revolution through his literary works.\\nPhilippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people. While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the aswang , the manananggal , the diwata / engkanto , and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling , Lam-Ang , and the Sarimanok . [505]\\nPhilippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English. Some of the most known were created from the 17th to 19th\\xa0century. Adarna , for example, is a famous epic about an eponymous magical bird allegedly written by José de la Cruz or \"Huseng Sisiw\". [506] Francisco Balagtas , the poet and playwright who wrote Florante at Laura , is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language. José Rizal wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Filibustering, also known as The Reign of Greed). He is considered a national hero. [507] His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule, and his death by firing squad, inspired other Filipino revolutionaries to seek independence. [508] Several Filipino writers were awarded National Artist of the Philippines such as N. V. M. Gonzalez , Amado V. Hernandez , Francisco Arcellana , Nick Joaquín , F. Sionil José and many more.\\nMedia\\nMain articles: Television in the Philippines , Radio in the Philippines , and Philippine drama\\nPhilippine media uses mainly Filipino and English. Other Philippine languages, including various Visayan languages are also used, especially in radio due to its ability to reach remote rural locations that might otherwise not be serviced by other kinds of media. The dominant television networks ABS-CBN , GMA and TV5 also have extensive radio presence. [509]\\nThe entertainment industry is vibrant and feeds broadsheets and tabloids with an unending supply of details about celebrities and sensationalist daily scandals. Drama and fantasy shows are anticipated as are Latin telenovelas , Asianovelas , and anime . Daytime television is dominated by game shows, variety shows, and talk shows such as Eat Bulaga and It\\'s Showtime . [510] Philippine cinema has a long history and is popular domestically, but has faced increasing competition from American , Asian and European films . Critically acclaimed directors and actors include Lino Brocka and Nora Aunor for films like Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag (Manila: In the Claws of Light) and Himala (Miracle). [511] [512] [513] [514] In recent years it has become common to see celebrities flitting between television and movies and then moving into politics provoking concerns. [515]\\nCinema\\nMain article: Cinema of the Philippines\\nBrillante Mendoza is a prominent Filipino film director.\\nSalón de Pertierra was the first introduced moving picture on January 1, 1897 in the Philippines. All films were all in Spanish since Philippine cinema was first introduced during the final years of the Spanish era of the country. Antonio Ramos was the first known movie producer. He used the Lumiere Cinematograph when he filmed Panorama de Manila (Manila landscape), Fiesta de Quiapo (Quiapo Fiesta), Puente de España (Bridge of Spain), and Escenas Callejeras (Street scenes). Meanwhile, Jose Nepomuceno was dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\". [516] Dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\", his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines. [517] His first film produced was entitled Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden) in 1919.\\nFilm showing resumed in 1900 during the American period . Walgrah, a British entrepreneur, opened the Cine Walgrah at No. 60 Calle Santa Rosa in Intramuros . It was also during this time that a movie market was formally created in the country along with the arrival of silent movies. These silent films were always accompanied by gramophone, a piano, a quartet, or a 200-man choir. During the Japanese occupation , filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of Philippine cinema with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures.\\nDuring the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft porn) pictures and an era of musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. [518] The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry. [519] In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.

      "[0.0006313009263686297, '2 million reasons for withdrawing 51 troops\\nRene P. Ciria-Cruz, Pacific News Service\\nPublished 4:00\\xa0am, Monday, July 26, 2004\\nAn old man talking to himself again\\nAmerican officials, several of their allies and many U.S. media criticized Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo \\'s decision to recall her nation\\'s small military contingent in Iraq in order to save the life of Filipino hostage Angelo dela Cruz . They called the move cowardly and said it sent terrorists \"the wrong signal.\"\\nFor most of dela Cruz\\'s compatriots, however, and from the standpoint of their national interest, it was a sensible, even courageous move. There was more at stake in Arroyo\\'s decision to pull out of Iraq than saving the life of an unfortunate hostage or avoiding the ire of the U.S. government, a key source of foreign aid for the Philippines. The hostage crisis imperiled a crucial survival mechanism for the impoverished nation -- the gainful employment of millions of overseas Filipino workers in the Middle East. Some 2 million Filipinos work in the region, with nearly a million in Saudi Arabia alone, according to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs .\\nThese large contingents of Filipino workers have become a critical prop of the Philippine economy. They represent the millions who can\\'t find work in their own country. They send home some $8 billion a year (remittances were largely responsible for a 4.5 percent GNP growth in 2002), providing otherwise income-strapped families the spending power that keeps the economy afloat. A number of Filipinos have been among the unintended victims of suicide bombings in Israel, and a number were killed in recent attacks on foreigners working for American firms in Saudi Arabia.\\nFor Arroyo to insist on remaining in the so-called \"coalition of the willing,\" despite the terrorists\\' threats, would have exposed all Filipinos in the region to a dramatically higher level of danger -- where they are transformed into deliberate targets of terror because their government persists in giving political cover to Bush\\'s \"coalition\" by keeping a symbolic military contingent in Iraq.\\nIn such an eventuality, the mass return of millions of Filipino workers evading terrorist attacks in the Middle East would mean disaster for the Philippine economy. The Philippine government is simply not prepared to absorb a sudden influx of jobless returnees. The large-scale repatriation of Filipinos from the Middle East also would mean trouble for many Arab countries -- including some of America\\'s allies -- that have come to depend on imported Filipino labor or expertise for a multitude of tasks, from domestic work to construction and management. There can be no doubt that President Arroyo\\'s decision to pull out of Iraq to protect other Filipinos was quietly encouraged by many an Arab host government.\\nClearly, Arroyo\\'s decision was also politically self-serving, given the popular outcry for dela Cruz\\'s safe return. Overseas Filipino workers -- an estimated 8 million labor in 150 countries -- risk their lives and endure long absences from their families. They\\'re often called modern-day heroes by Filipino officials and media alike. In 1995, President Fidel Ramos \\' popularity plunged when he failed to save the life of Flor Contemplacion, a domestic worker who was hanged by the government of Singapore on a questionable murder conviction. Dela Cruz\\'s kidnapping brought back memories of that execution, and the political danger was not lost on Arroyo. She had just assumed office after a bitter election whose credibility is held in doubt. Failure to bring back dela Cruz alive would have given her enemies effective ammunition in a poisonous political climate rife with talk of destabilization plots.\\nFor most Filipino opinion-makers -- and from the standpoint of the Philippines\\' national interest -- pulling out of Iraq was not a \"wrong signal\" to terrorists. The wrong signal was to send a troop contingent to begin with, which only served to militarize the longstanding and purely civilian Filipino presence in the Middle East and made it a likely target of terrorist attacks.\\nAs for Washington\\'s implied threat of leaving the Philippines at the mercy of its homegrown terrorists, it\\'s empty and face-saving. The Philippines remains the most important staging area for U.S. operations against al Qaeda\\'s affiliates in Southeast Asia, as predominantly Muslim Indonesia and Malaysia are less than ideal hosts. In fact, several U.S. military exercises are set to take place in Southern Philippines. Like it or not, Washington is stuck with Manila, and Manila knows it.\\nLatest from the SFGATE homepage:\\nClick below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

[34] \\u200b Existen varias teorías sobre los orígenes de los primeros habitantes de las islas. Landa Jocano sugiere que los antepasados de los filipinos actuales surgieron y se desarrollaron localmente. Por su parte, la teoría del origen isleño de Wilhelm Solheim postula que el poblamiento del archipiélago se dio a través de las rutas de comercio que provenían de la zona de Sonda alrededor de los años 48\\xa0000 a 5000 a.\\xa0C., en vez de una migración a gran escala. [35] \\u200b La teoría de la expansión austronesia afirma que varios grupos malayo-polinesios procedentes de la isla de Taiwán comenzaron a migrar a Filipinas alrededor del 4000 a.\\xa0C., desplazando a los primeros pobladores.

[17] \\u200b Para el año 1000 a.\\xa0C., los habitantes del archipiélago se habían organizado en cuatro tipos de grupos sociales: las tribus de cazadores-recolectores , sociedades guerreras, plutocracias pequeñas y principados con centro en los puertos marítimos. [38] \\u200b\\nEn el transcurso de los siguientes siglos, el comercio con los pueblos marítimos y otros países asiáticos trajo consigo la influencia del islam , el budismo y el hinduismo . Durante este tiempo no hubo ningún Estado político unificador que abarcara todo el archipiélago filipino. En su lugar, las islas estaban divididas entre varias talasocracias que a menudo luchaban entre sí, gobernadas por varios datus , rajás o sultanes . Entre ellos estaban los reinos de Manila , Namayan y Tondo , los rajanatos de Butuan y Cebú y los sultanatos de Maguindanao y Sulú .

En 1571, después de tratar con las familias reales nativas durante la conspiración de Tondo y tras derrotar a la tripulación del pirata chino Limahong , los españoles establecieron en Manila la capital de Filipinas y de las Indias Orientales Españolas . [45] \\u200b [21] \\u200b\\nEl dominio español significó la unidad política del archipiélago por primera vez en su historia. Desde 1565 hasta 1821 la Capitanía General de las Filipinas dependió del Virreinato de la Nueva España con sede en la ciudad de México y después de la Guerra de Independencia de México , se administró directamente desde Madrid. Desde esta misma Capitanía, España controlaba otros de sus territorios en el Pacífico , entre ellos Guam , Palaos , las Islas Carolinas y las Islas Marianas . [46] \\u200b Entre los siglos XVI y XIX, el galeón de Manila comunicó la capital de Filipinas con Acapulco , realizando un viaje o dos al año en ambas direcciones. El comercio transpacífico introdujo en el archipiélago alimentos como el maíz , el tomate , la patata , el chile y la piña , todos procedentes de América . [21] \\u200b Los misioneros católicos convirtieron a la mayoría de los habitantes al cristianismo y fundaron escuelas, universidades y hospitales. Los españoles también llevaron a Filipinas el arado , la imprenta , el reloj y la construcción en piedra. Un decreto español de 1863 estableció la educación pública gratuita en el país por primera vez, lo que dio lugar a altos índices de alfabetización. [47] \\u200b\\nMoneda de un cuarto de 1829, emitida en Manila. Muestra el escudo de España.\\nDurante el periodo de gobierno español, las fuerzas hispano-indígenas lucharon contra varias rebeliones internas y múltiples ataques externos, de piratas chinos, de holandeses y portugueses: son especialmente destacables los Combates de Cagayán (1582), que enfrentaron a los famosos Tercios españoles contra piratas y samuráis japoneses. En una extensión de los combates de la Guerra de los Siete Años , fuerzas británicas ocuparon brevemente la ciudad de Manila. Las fuerzas inglesas encontraron aliados como Diego y Gabriela Silang , que aprovecharon la oportunidad para liderar una revuelta, hasta que el gobierno español finalmente fue restaurado tras el Tratado de París de 1763 . [19] \\u200b [48] \\u200b [49] \\u200b Durante la ocupación británica, los invasores aprovecharon para sustraer valiosas cartas de navegación del Pacífico de los archivos de Manila. Esas cartas, el resultado de siglos de exploración española, acabaron en manos de navegantes ingleses como James Cook, que utilizaron más tarde en sus propias expediciones.\\nJosé Rizal , Marcelo del Pilar y Mariano Ponce , líderes del Movimiento de Propaganda.\\nEn el siglo XIX, los puertos filipinos se abrieron al comercio mundial y se produjeron cambios en la sociedad filipina. A principio de siglo comenzó a sentirse la influencia de los movimientos independentistas sudamericanos. El 1 de febrero de 1818 arribó Hipólito Bouchard , corsario de las Provincias Unidas de Sudamérica , a bordo de la fragata La Argentina . Durante dos meses mantuvo bloqueada la bahía de Manila, cerrando además el estrecho de San Bernandino [50] \\u200b. En este período muchos españoles nacidos en Filipinas ( criollos ) y los de ascendencia mixta ( mestizos ) se hicieron ricos. La afluencia de colonos españoles y latinoamericanos disminuyó el poder de la Iglesia y abrió algunos puestos en el gobierno tradicionalmente ocupados por los españoles nacidos en la península Ibérica ( peninsulares ). Los ideales de la revolución también comenzaron a extenderse a través de las islas. La insatisfacción de los criollos resultó en la revuelta de Cavite El Viejo en 1872 , una de las precursoras de la Revolución filipina .

[51] \\u200b [52] \\u200b Esto inspiró un movimiento de propaganda en España organizado por Marcelo H. del Pilar , José Rizal y Mariano Ponce , quienes presionaron al gobierno para introducir reformas políticas en Filipinas. Finalmente Rizal fue arrestado y, acusado de rebelión, ejecutado el 30 de diciembre de 1896. [55] \\u200b Como los intentos para lograr estas reformas encontraron una gran resistencia, en 1892 Andrés Bonifacio fundó una sociedad secreta llamada Katipunan , relacionada con grupos de masones que buscaban la independencia del gobierno español por medio de una revuelta armada. [53] \\u200b Bonifacio y Katipunan comenzaron la Revolución filipina en 1896. Una facción del Katipunan, los Magdalo de la provincia de Cavite , llegó a desafiar la posición de Bonifacio como líder de la revolución y Emilio Aguinaldo lo relevó.\\nEdición de The Tribune del 24 de abril de 1942, anunciando la invasión japonesa de Filipinas.\\nEn 1898, la Guerra hispano-estadounidense comenzó en Cuba y posteriormente se extendió al archipiélago filipino ya sumergido en una revuelta. El 12 de junio de 1898, Aguinaldo declaró la independencia filipina de España en Kawit , Cavite, y al año siguiente se estableció la Primera República Filipina . Por su parte, cuando España perdió la guerra firmó el Tratado de París en 1898 , en el cual cedió el dominio de las islas a Estados Unidos por US$ 20 millones. [22] \\u200b Como se hacía cada vez más evidente que los Estados Unidos no reconocerían a la Primera República Filipina, estalló la Guerra filipino-estadounidense . Al perder el conflicto, el archipiélago terminó bajo el control total estadounidense, ya que hasta entonces había sido administrado como un área insular ; en 1935, Filipinas obtuvo el estatus de « Estado libre asociado » [23] \\u200b bajo el nombre de Mancomunidad Filipina .\\nEn la década siguiente, los planes por recuperar la independencia fueron interrumpidos por la Segunda Guerra Mundial , en particular cuando el Imperio japonés invadió el país y estableció un gobierno títere , la Segunda República Filipina . Durante el conflicto se cometieron múltiples crímenes de guerra , como la Marcha de la Muerte de Batán y la Masacre de Manila , que culminó con la batalla de Manila . [56] \\u200b Los crímenes contra la población de origen español y los asaltos a las sedes oficiales españolas en Filipinas provocaron gran inquietud en el gobierno de Francisco Franco . Como consecuencia, España rompió las relaciones diplomáticas con Japón el 12 de abril de 1945. [57] \\u200b Para cuando las tropas aliadas hubieron derrotado a los japoneses en 1945, más de un millón de filipinos habían muerto.

[6] \\u200b\\nDictadura de Marcos y Tercera República Filipina[ editar ]\\nFerdinand e Imelda Marcos en su visita a Estados Unidos en 1966.\\nTras lograr su independencia, la joven nación se enfrentó a varios problemas: el país tenía que ser reconstruido de los estragos de la guerra y llegar a un acuerdo con varios colaboradores y empresarios japoneses para comenzar su desarrollo económico. Mientras tanto, el Hukbalahap , un ejército rebelde comunista que anteriormente luchaba contra los japoneses, continuaba activo en las regiones rurales. Finalmente, esta amenaza fue abordada por el Secretario de la Defensa Nacional y posterior presidente Ramón Magsaysay , aunque se siguieron presentando algunos casos esporádicos de insurgencia comunista. [25] \\u200b [59] \\u200b En 1965, Ferdinand Marcos fue elegido presidente, con su esposa Imelda Marcos a su lado. Como la Constitución prohibía ser reelegido más de dos veces para el cargo presidencial, al final de su segundo mandato declaró la ley marcial el 21 de septiembre de 1972. Para seguir gobernando por decreto, utilizó como argumentos la división política, la tensión de la Guerra Fría y el espectro de la rebelión comunista y de la insurgencia islámica en el país. [60] \\u200b De esta manera inició una dictadura que duró más de diez años y que se caracterizó por el estricto control de la economía y por la represión política. [61] \\u200b [62] \\u200b\\nEl 21 de agosto de 1983, Benigno «Ninoy» Aquino, Jr. , líder de la oposición al gobierno de Marcos, ignoró las advertencias y regresó del exilio en Estados Unidos. Fue asesinado al aterrizar su avión en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Manila —ahora llamado Aeropuerto Internacional Ninoy Aquino, en su memoria—. Al aumentar la presión política, Marcos convocó a elecciones presidenciales en 1986. [25] \\u200b Corazón Aquino , viuda de Benigno, se convirtió en la líder de la oposición y en candidata para la contienda presidencial. Cuando Marcos se proclamó ganador, muchos pensaron que las elecciones habían estado arregladas. Esto condujo a la Revolución EDSA , instigada cuando dos de los aliados más antiguos de Marcos — Fidel V. Ramos , Jefe del Estado Mayor adjunto de las Fuerzas Armadas, y Juan Ponce Enrile , Secretario de la Defensa Nacional— renunciaron y se manifestaron en el campo Aguinaldo y el campo Crame. El Cardenal Arzobispo de Manila, Jaime Sin , exhortó a las personas a reunirse en apoyo a los líderes rebeldes y a protestar en la Avenida Epifanio de los Santos (EDSA). Ante las protestas masivas y las deserciones militares, Marcos y sus aliados huyeron a Hawái , donde fueron exiliados. Ese mismo año, Corazón Aquino fue nombrada presidenta.

Aunque la economía mejoró durante la administración de Fidel V. Ramos, quien fue elegido presidente en 1992, [24] \\u200b el inicio de la crisis financiera asiática de 1997 frenó estos avances. En 2001, en medio de acusaciones de corrupción y un proceso de destitución estancado, el sucesor de Ramos, Joseph Estrada , fue expulsado de la presidencia por la Revolución de EDSA de 2001 y reemplazado por Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo . Finalmente, como resultado de las elecciones de mayo de 2010 , Benigno «Noynoy» Aquino III fue elegido presidente.

As all of Nepomuceno\\'s films are lost, most of the information was gathered from old newspaper articles on microfilm in different archives in Manila. Many of these articles were hitherto undiscovered. Nepomuceno made silent films at a time when the influence of the new coloniser, United States, was growing, and the Spanish language was what unified the intellectual opposition. Previous research on Nepomuceno has focused on the Hispanic influences on his filmmaking, as well as his connections to the stage drama. This paper argues that Nepomuceno created a national consciousness by making films showing native lives and environments, adapting important Filipino novels and plays to the screen and covering important political topics and thereby creating public opinion. Many reviews in the newspapers connected his films to nation-building and independence, as the creation of a national consciousness is a cornerstone in the process of building a nation and defining \"Filipino\". Furthermore, the films of Nepomuceno helped spreading the Tagalog culture and language to other parts of the Philippines, hence making Tagalog the foundation of the national Filipino language.\\nPlace, publisher, year, edition, pages\\n2006. , 75 p.\\nAsia, the Philippines, film history, history, nation, culture, identity, Nepomuceno, colonisation, language, archive studies\\nNational Category\\n', 24]\n",

In 2000, roughly one-third of the population (nearly 27 million Filipinos) lacked the roughly US$275 required annually to satisfy food and non-food basic needs, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) estimates. Such poverty, exacerbated by prolonged El Niño-induced drought and the residual effects of the 1997/1998 financial crisis that shook the region, limits the ability of the poor to gain access to health and other services.\\nThe Philippines is also among the world's fastest urbanizing countries, and overcrowded cities present their own challenges. With some 47 percent of the population living in urban areas, compared with 31 percent in Thailand and 16 percent in Cambodia, the country has more than 200 urban areas that have populations of more than 50,000, notes the country's Commission on Population (POPCOM). By World Bank estimates, these urban centers could expand to some 600 by 2020, largely because high levels of rural poverty are pushing people into the cities.\\nThe concentration of economic development in relatively few urban areas and rapid population growth throughout the country are other factors contributing to urban sprawl. Compared with other countries in the region, the Philippines is experiencing rapid population growth. The rate of natural increase — the birth rate minus the death rate — is 2.2 percent, compared with 0.8 percent in Thailand and Singapore and 1.9 percent in Malaysia.\\nIn addition to fleeing to urban commercial centers, many people leave the country for work. An average of 2,500 Filipinos leave the country every day for work abroad, and the Philippines is second only to Mexico as an exporter of labor. An estimated 10 percent of the country's population, or nearly 8 million people, are overseas Filipino workers distributed in 182 countries, according to POPCOM. That is in addition to the estimated 3 million migrants who work illegally abroad. According to official statistics of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, Filipino workers abroad sent home US$6.8 billion in 1999 alone. A large proportion of these remittances come from women who are the majority of overseas Filipino workers.\\n\\xa0\\n\", 205]\n",
      "[0.0003988500822530176, 'The Philippines\\' Culture of Migration\\nJanuary 1, 2006\\nProfile\\nBy Maruja M.B. Asis\\nSince the 1970s, the Philippines — a country of about 7,000 islands peopled by diverse ethno-linguistic groups — has supplied all kinds of skilled and low-skilled workers to the world\\'s more developed regions. As of December 2004, an estimated 8.1 million Filipinos — nearly 10 percent of the country\\'s 85 million people — were working and/or residing in close to 200 countries and territories.\\nAlthough the Philippines is largely a country of emigration, it also attracts some foreigners to its shores. Traditionally, the foreign population in the Philippines consists of people of Chinese origin (some 80 percent of overseas Chinese are in Southeast Asia) and some people of Indian origin who came to settle in the country years ago.\\nPresently, there are 36,150 foreign nationals working and residing in the Philippines. The inflows of foreigners to the country, as well as concerns for unauthorized migration and the use of the Philippines as a transit point for other destinations, point to a reality in this age of migration: that countries can no longer be neatly and exclusively classified as countries of origin, transit, or destination.\\nMuch of the country\\'s attention and policies, though, are focused on emigration. A film released in June 2005, La Visa Loca, captures an ordinary Filipino\\'s feverish quest for a U.S. visa, the perceived ticket to a better life. In reality, the quest for a visa is not limited to the United States. Other promised lands in different regions — the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Oceania — have become the objects of Filipino dreams.\\nIn the last 30 years, a \"culture of migration\" has emerged, with millions of Filipinos eager to work abroad, despite the risks and vulnerabilities they are likely to face. A nationwide survey of 1,200 adult respondents in 2002 found one in five Filipinos expressing a desire to migrate.\\nMore recent surveys carried out by Pulse Asia in 2005 found an increasing percentage of adult respondents — 26 percent in July and 33 percent in October — agreeing with the statement, \"If it were only possible, I would migrate to another country and live there.\" Interest in leaving the country is not limited to adults. In a nationwide survey in 2003 of children ages 10 to 12, 47 percent reported that they wished to work abroad someday. Sixty percent of children of overseas foreign workers said they had plans to work abroad.\\nThe development of a culture of migration in the Philippines has been greatly aided by migration\\'s institutionalization. The government facilitates migration, regulates the operations of the recruitment agencies, and looks out for the rights of its migrant workers. More importantly, the remittances workers send home have become a pillar of the country\\'s economy.\\nHistorical Background\\nAfter more than three centuries of Spanish colonial rule, the revolution waged by Filipinos in 1896 almost led to the end of Spanish rule. After a year of fighting, the revolutionaries and the Spanish authorities signed a truce in December 1897, and General Emilio Aguinaldo went into exile in Hong Kong.\\nThe Spanish-American War broke out in February 1898, sparked by the United States\\' support for Cuba\\'s fight against Spain. This spilled over into the Philippines. An American fleet led by Admiral George Dewey arrived in Manila, defeating Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898.\\nUpon the urging of Admiral Dewey to resume the fight against Spain, General Aguinaldo returned to Manila on May 18, 1898. General Aguinaldo\\'s forces liberated several towns south of Manila and declared independence from Spain on June 12, 1898. More American forces arrived, and the Spaniards surrendered Manila to the Americans that August.\\nOn December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed between the United States and Spain, formally ending the Spanish-American War. Under the treaty, the United States paid Spain to take control of the Philippines. Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Mariana Islands were ceded to the United States as well.\\nFilipinos resisted American rule, and the ensuing Philippine-American War, which began in 1899, dragged on even after it \"officially\" ended with the capture of General Aguinaldo in 1901, followed by the establishment of a civil government throughout the Philippines in 1902. The Philippines became independent in July 1946, after the Japanese invasion and occupation of World War II.\\nFor much of the 20th century, \"international migration\" for Filipinos meant going to the United States and its Pacific territories. The first batch of Filipino workers arrived in the U.S. territory of Hawaii on December 20, 1906 to work on sugarcane and pineapple plantations.\\nMore workers, mostly single men, followed; others left Hawaii to work in agriculture in California, Washington, and Oregon, or the salmon canneries of Alaska. On the mainland, low-wage service work in the cities — waiters, busboys, or domestic work — provided alternative jobs between agricultural seasons or when other jobs are not available. Some 4,000 Filipinos were employed in the merchant marine, but this employment possibility ceased with the 1937 passage of a law requiring the crew of U.S. flag vessels to be at least 90 percent American citizens.\\nAccording to one estimate, approximately 120,000 Filipino workers came to Hawaii between 1906 and 1934. Another estimate puts the number of Filipinos arriving in the United States between 1907 and the 1930 at 150,000, the majority of whom were in Hawaii. A small number of scholars, known as pensionados, also immigrated to the United States before the 1920s. They were either sponsored by the U.S. government or by missionary-related programs. Some were sent by rich families to study and a few were self-supporting students. Those who returned assumed important positions in Filipino society while others remained in the United States.\\nBecause the Philippines was a U.S. colony, the movement of Filipinos to the United States was considered internal migration and Filipino migrants were \"nationals\" (but not citizens). It was not until the passage of the 1934 Tydings-McDuffie Law (also known as the Philippines Independence Act of 1934), which provided for the granting of Philippine independence in 10 years\\' time, that the Philippines became subject to immigration quotas. The 1934 law limited the Philippines to 50 visas per year, and migration dropped off dramatically.\\nBut even so, there was an exception clause: in case of a labor shortage, the governor of Hawaii was authorized to hire Filipino workers. As nationals, Filipinos were entitled to American passports and could enter and leave the country freely. World War II intervened and further migration to the United States stalled. Between 1946 and the mid 1960s, about 10,000 to 12,000 Filipinos came to Hawaii as workers, military personnel, and war brides.\\nIt was not until the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, when nationality-based restrictions were struck down, that Filipino immigration grew and diversified.\\nOther countries of settlement also dismantled their pro-European immigration policies in the 1960s and 1970s, paving the way for Filipinos to enter Canada, Australia, and New Zealand under family or skills-based provisions. The Philippines eventually became one of the top 10 sending countries in these traditional immigration countries.\\nFilipinos also settled in countries that are not traditional countries of immigration, such as Germany and Japan, through marriage or work-related migration. This permanent migration, however, was overshadowed by the larger and thornier temporary labor migration that started in the 1970s.\\nBecoming a Labor Exporter\\nThe Philippines\\' ascent as a major labor exporter in Asia and worldwide is based on various factors. When large-scale labor migration from the Philippines started in the 1970s, the \"push\" factors were very strong but made worse by the oil crisis in 1973. Among others, economic growth could not keep up with population growth. The country was hard pressed to provide jobs and decent wages and had severe balance of payment problems.\\nAt the same time, the oil-rich Gulf countries needed workers to realize their ambitious infrastructure projects. With supply and demand factors converging, the Philippines was ripe for large-scale labor migration, an opportunity the Marcos government recognized. The framework for what became the government\\'s overseas employment program was established with the passage of the Labor Code of the Philippines in 1974.\\nThe Philippines\\' foray into organized international labor migration was supposed to be temporary, lasting only until the country recovered from its economic problems. However, the continuing demand for workers in the Gulf countries and the opening of new labor markets in other regions, especially in East and Southeast Asia, fueled further migration.\\nOn the supply side, the push factors have not abated. The absence of sustained economic development, political instability, a growing population, double-digit unemployment levels, and low wages continue to compel people to look abroad.\\nThe flow of overseas foreign workers (OFWs), numbering a few thousand per year in the early 1970s, has grown to hundreds of thousands (see Table 1). In 2004 alone, 933,588 OFWs left the country. Based on trends, it is expected that the number of deployed OFWs will hit the one million mark in 2005.\\nTable 1. Annual Deployment of Filipino Workers, 1975-2004*\\nYear\\n229,002\\n933,588\\n*Figures for 1975 to 1983 refer to number of contracts processed; figures for 1984 to 2004 refer to number of workers deployed abroad.\\nSources: Table 5 (Battistella, 1995:265) for figures from 1975 to 1983; available online for figures from 1983 to 2003; and for 2004 data . Internet sources were accessed on 12 September 2005.\\nThe data on deployed workers include seafarers, who account for some 20 percent of all OFWs leaving the country every year (see Table 2). Filipinos dominate the industry: 25 percent of the world\\'s seafarers are from the Philippines.\\nTable 2. Regional Distribution of Land-based Overseas Filipino Workers, 2004*\\nRegion\\n704,586\\n100.00\\n*Based on combined data for new hires and rehires. Source: Available online , accessed 12 September 2005.\\nAs of December 2004, the stock of overseas Filipinos include some 3.2 million permanent settlers (the majority of whom are in the United States), about 3.6 million temporary labor migrants (called OFWs), with Saudi Arabia hosting close to a million, and an estimated 1.3 million migrants in an unauthorized situation. The latter tend to be mostly in the United States and Malaysia.\\nWomen are very visible in international migration from the Philippines. They not only compose the majority of permanent settlers, i.e., as part of family migration, but they are as prominent as men in labor migration. In fact, since 1992, female migrants outnumbered men among the newly hired land-based workers who are legally deployed every year.\\nThe majority of female OFWs are in domestic work and entertainment. Since these are unprotected sectors, female migration has raised many concerns about the safety and well-being of women migrants. Female OFWs can also be found in factory work, sales, and nursing.\\nAmong the top 10 destinations of OFWs, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Singapore, Italy, United Arab Emirates, Japan, and Taiwan are dominated by women OFWs. In Hong Kong, for example, more than 90 percent of OFWs are women (Table 2).\\nHow Labor Export Works\\nWith its low rate of foreign investment and a steady reduction in development assistance, the government, not just its people, has come to rely on overseas employment as a strategy for survival. After years of pushing the official line that it does not promote overseas employment, the government set a target in 2001 of deploying a million workers overseas every year, a goal it is likely to meet in 2005.\\nSince the 1970s, the government and the private sector each have played a role in the labor export process. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) grew out of the Overseas Employment Development Board and the National Seamen Board in the then Ministry of Labor and Employment. POEA became the government agency responsible for processing workers\\' contracts and predeployment checks, as well as for licensing, regulating, and monitoring private recruitment agencies.\\nWhen the overseas program started, the government participated in recruiting and matching workers and employers. Due to demand for workers and the large numbers involved, the government relinquished the placement of workers to private recruitment agencies in 1976. There is a placement branch within the POEA, but it only accounts for a small number of all OFWs placed with foreign employers.\\nOn the private-sector side, there are more than 1,000 government-licensed recruitment and manning agencies in the Philippines (and an unknown number of unlicensed ones) that match workers with foreign employers. In the Philippines, recruitment agencies refer to those that find jobs for aspiring land-based migrant workers; manning agencies refer to those that engage in recruiting and finding jobs for seafarers.\\nRecruitment agencies charge migrant workers \"placement fees\" for the service that they provide. Manning agencies are not supposed to charge placement fees as these fees are assumed by the principal or employer, but there are cases of known violations.\\nAlthough there is a standard placement fee for most destinations (except for special markets such as Taiwan) which is equivalent to one month\\'s salary plus 5,000 Philippine pesos (about US$94) for documentation, this is routinely violated. The excessive fees are a burden to migrants and put them in a vulnerable situation because they are already in debt before they leave. When they are abroad, they go without any salary for a period of time, and they are forced to bear harsh working and living conditions in order to repay their loans.\\nAnother government agency, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), provides support and assistance to migrants and their families. All processes and requirements up until the point of departure are handled by the POEA, while the OWWA assumes responsibility for the workers\\' welfare while they are employed abroad. POEA and OWWA are under the Department of Labor and Employment.\\nA separate agency, the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO), provides programs and services to permanent emigrants. CFO was transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Office of the President in 2004.\\nAmong the countries of origin in Asia, the Philippines offers a fairly comprehensive package of programs and services covering all phases of migration, from predeparture to on-site services to return and reintegration. Although the government could improve its implementation of these programs, the programs demonstrate the government\\'s efforts to balance the marketing of workers with protection.\\nSome of these initiatives, such as the predeparture orientation seminars for departing workers and the deployment of labor attachés and welfare officers to countries with large OFW populations, are good practices that other countries of origin have also implemented.\\nProtecting Workers Abroad\\nThe irregular operations of recruitment agencies in the Philippines and their counterparts in the countries of destination are one of the sources of vulnerabilities for migrant workers. Excessive placement fees, contract substitution, nonpayment or delayed wages, and difficult working and living conditions are common problems encountered by migrant workers, including legal ones.\\nMigrant women face particular vulnerabilities. Aside from the usual problems that plague migrants, their jobs in domestic work and entertainment usually mean long working hours, surveillance and control by employers, and abusive conditions, including violence and sexual harassment. Given the \"private\" context in which they work, the problems encountered by migrant women in these sectors go unnoticed.\\nIn general, compared to other national groups, Filipino workers are relatively better protected because they are more educated, more likely to speak English, and they are better organized. NGOs for migrants in the Philippines and their networks abroad not only provide services and support to migrants, but, more importantly, they advocate for migrants\\' rights\\nThe development of a legal and institutional framework to promote migrant workers\\' protection is also an important factor. The Philippines was the first among the countries of origin in Asia to craft a law that aims \"to establish a higher standard of protection and promotion of the welfare of migrant workers, their families and overseas Filipinos in distress.\" Although there had been discussions about a Magna Charta for migrant workers for some time, it was not until 1995 that the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act (also known as Republic Act or RA8042) was finally passed.\\nThe tipping point was the national furor in 1995 over the execution of Flor Contemplación, a domestic worker in Singapore, who many Filipinos believed was innocent despite her conviction for the deaths of her Singaporean ward and another Filipino domestic worker. This was a factor in fast-tracking the passage of RA8042.\\nBriefly, the law\\'s provisions include:\\nthe deployment of workers in countries that ensure protection, including the banning of deployment if necessary;\\nproviding support and assistance to overseas Filipinos, whether legal or in an unauthorized situation;\\nimposing stiff penalties for illegal recruiters;\\nfree legal assistance and witness protection program for victims of illegal recruitment;\\nthe institution of advisory/information, repatriation, and reintegration services;\\nthe stipulation that the \"protection of Filipino migrant workers and the promotion of their welfare, in particular, and the protection of the dignity and fundamental rights and freedoms of the Filipino abroad, in general, shall be the his/her priority concerns of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Foreign Service Posts;\"\\nthe establishment of the Migrant Workers and Other Overseas Filipinos Resource Centers in countries where there are large numbers of Filipinos;\\nand the creation of the Legal Assistant for Migrant Workers Affairs (now the Office of the Undersecretary of Migrant Workers Affairs) and the Legal Assistance Fund.\\nThe haste with which RA8042 was passed has resulted in some problematic provisions, leading to calls for amendments. For example, in the Declaration of Policies, it is mentioned that \"the State does not promote overseas employment as a means to sustain economic growth and achieve national development.\" Some sectors, such as the NGO community, believe the state does promote labor migration.\\nOne controversial provision is Section 29, which deals with the deregulation of recruitment activities. If this were implemented, the regulatory functions of the POEA would have been phased out in 2001, that is, within five years of the law becoming effective. NGOs are against the deregulation plan because the playing field already is highly uneven. The recruitment agencies, on the other hand, are pushing for deregulation.\\nOverall, RA8042 has not been a complete failure. Some provisions have been implemented well (e.g., there are various information programs in place); some need to be fine-tuned, notably programs dealing with returning migrants and their reintegration in the local economy. There are also moves to amend certain sections of the law.\\nThe Office of the Undersecretary of Migrant Workers Affairs, under the Department of Foreign Affairs, provides assistance to migrant workers who encounter legal problems abroad, while the National Labor Relations Council handles employment-related problems such as money claims.\\nIn addition to government initiatives, the efforts of NGOs, church-based organizations, and migrants\\' organizations, as well as transnational and international efforts directed at promoting and protecting migrants\\' rights, help provide an \"antidote\" to the dangers of migration.\\nAmong the countries of origin in Asia, the Philippines is also a leader in introducing several migration-related laws. These include:\\nthe Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, which establishes policies and institutional mechanisms to provide support to trafficked persons;\\nthe Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003, which gives qualified overseas Filipinos the right to vote in national elections; and\\nthe Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003, which allows for dual citizenship.\\nIn terms of commitments to international norms and standards concerning migrants, the Philippines is one of 34 countries (as of October 27, 2005) that has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families. It is also one of 95 countries (as of November 6, 2005) that has ratified the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.\\nRemittances\\nAside from easing unemployment, Filipinos who choose to work abroad send home remittances that have become an important pillar of the Philippine economy (see Table 3). In 2004, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, remittances sent through formal channels amounted to US$8.5 billion. In 2005, remittances are expected to reach US$10 billion.\\nTable 3.

But there is also a rich underlay   of Malay culture beneath the patina of Spanish and American heritage. National   cultural life is a happy marriage of many influences, as the indigenous Malay   culture is assimilated and adapted to different strains in a practice typical   of Malay temperament. An upsurge of Philippine nationalism stimulated a desire   to preserve the ancient heritage without restricting its openness to foreign   artistic influence.\\nThe Philippines is an archipelago of 7,107 islands. It stretches from the south of China to the northern tip of Borneo. The country has over a hundred ethnic groups and a mixture of foreign influences which have molded a unique Filipino culture.\\nBefore the Spanish explorers came, Indo-Malays and Chinese merchants had settled   here. In 1521, the Spaniards, led by Ferdinand Magellan, discovered the islands.   The Spanish conquistadores established a colonial government in Cebu in 1565.   They transferred the seat of government to Manila in 1571 and proceeded to   colonize the country. The Filipinos resisted and waged Asia\\'s first nationalist   revolution in 1896. On June 12, 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines   independent from Spain and proclaimed himself president. After ruling for 333   years, the Spaniards finally left in 1898 and were replaced by the Americans   who stayed for 48 years. On July 4, 1946, the Americans recognized Philippine   independence.\\nThe Philippines is the third largest English-speaking country in the world.   The country is divided into three geographical areas: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.   It has 17 regions,   81 provinces, 118 cities, 1,510 municipalities , and 41,995 barangays. (Barangay   - The smallest political unit into which cities and municipalities in the Philippines   are divided. It is the basic unit of the Philippine political system. It consists   of less than 1,000 inhabitants residing within the territorial limit of a city   or municipality and administered by a set of elective officials, headed by   a barangay chairman or punong barangay). Data as of December 2006.\\nGEOGRAPHY\\nThe Philippine archipelago is geographically located between latitude (approximately)   4o23\\'N   and  21o25\\'N and longitude (approximately) 112oE and 127oE.   It is composed of 7,107 islands, with a land area of 299,764 sq.kilometers.   Its length measures 1,850 kilometers, starting from the point near the southern   tip of Taiwan and ending close to northern Borneo. Its breadth is about 965   kilometers. The Philippine coastline adds up to 17,500 km. Three prominent   bodies of water surround the archipelago: the Pacific Ocean on the east, the   South China Sea on the west and north, and the Celebes Sea on the south. This   position accounts for much of the variations in geographic, climatic and vegetational   conditions in the country.\\nThe topography of the bigger islands - particularly Luzon and Mindanao - is characterized by alluvial plains, narrow valleys, rolling hills and high mountains. The highest mountains are found in Mindanao and Luzon, with the altitudes varying from 1,790 to 3,144 meters. Most of the smaller islands are mountainous in the interior, surrounded by narrow strips of discontinuous flat lowlands which constitute the coastal rims. The shorelines of both large and small islands are irregular.\\nThe Philippines\\' fertile land accounts for the more than 900 species of orchids representing 100 genera that have been found. The sampaguita is the national flower.\\nAmong the country\\'s fauna are some endangered species like the Philippine   Eagle, the tarsier, and the mouse deer.\\nMetro Manila is strategically located in the middle of Luzon, on the eastern coast of Manila Bay and at the mouth of the Pasig River, sprawled over an area of 626 sq.km. Manila sits in the middle of a swampy deltaic plain formed by accumulated sedimentary deposits from the Pasig River and other streams.\\nThe city is between the bay to the west, the highlands to the east, and Laguna de Bay to the southeast. Most of its densely populated areas are found along the Pasig River running across the metropolis dividing it into two sections - the north and the south.\\nTIME ZONE:\\nGMT + 8 hours. Check out the Philippine Standard Time\\nCAPSULE HISTORY\\nBefore the Spanish conquistadores came, a thriving community flourished on the banks of the Pasig River. It was called \"Maynilad\", after the nilad plant whose star-shaped flowers clustered in abundance along the low-lying river banks.\\nThe lord of the riverside kingdom was Raha Sulayman who held court on the south side of the river while his uncle, Lakandula, ruled on the north side. The Spaniards were set on conquering this community. After the savage Battle of Bangkusay, where they overtook the natives with their awesome firepower, the Spaniards conquered Manila. In this Battle, Sulayman was killed.\\nRealizing its strategic position as a trading center and military outpost, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, head of the Spanish expedition, promptly declared Manila the capital of the new colonies won by Spain. On June 24, 1571, Manila was declared the capital of the entire achipelago. Delighted by this conquest, the King of Spain awarded the city a coat of arms and the grandiose title: \"The Noble and Ever Loyal City\". Soon, Manila became a replica of a European medieval city. There were churches, palaces and city halls built in the Spanish baroque style. Work began on building a wall around the city to keep the pirates and Moros at bay. It took 150 years to finish this wall. The end result was an astounding eight foot-thick, three mile-long wall, with two forts and a bastion, 370 guns in place, manned by a force of 5,000 men and 10,000 reserves. This walled city became known as Intramuros.\\nBeautiful as it was, Intramuros stood as a perfect illustration of the discrimination at that time against the natives called Indios. Although it was built by Indio workers and Chinese artisans, Intramuros was meant only for the clergy and the Spanish nobility. The natives could not enter except to work as servants. Outside the walls, in the arabales or suburbs, lived the Indios, the Chinese and other foreigners. The diversity of trade and culture in the suburbs made it alive and interesting. Tondo, Binondo, Sta. Cruz, and Quiapo bustled with commerce. These places were home to the merchants, carpenters, blacksmiths, carriage makers, masons, and other artisans.\\nOver the centuries, the Spanish rule was occasionally threatened by attacks from the sea and by internal uprisings. The Chinese, Dutch and British all tried to lay siege on Manila but were unsuccessful. But the 1880\\'s saw the birth of a reform movement led by Marcelo H. Del Pilar, Lopez Jaena and Jose Rizal (the national hero). This reform movement ultimately led to a revolution and by 1898, the days of the Castilian rule were numbered. The most lasting legacy of the Spanish rule was the Catholic religion which makes the Philippines the only Christian nation in Asia.\\nBut as soon as the Spaniards left, the Americans took over. 1902 was the beginning of the American era, a period characterized by the expansion of public education, advances in health care and the introduction of democratic government. The outbreak of war in the Pacific in 1941 disrupted American rule. Manila was declared an open city and the Americans withdrew their defenses. For three years, Manila was occupied by the Japanese imperial forces. Life at that time was made difficult by strict Japanese military rule. When the American troops entered Manila to liberate it, they had to bomb the city to dislodge the tenacious Japanese. Manila was devastated.\\nOn July 4, 1946, a year after the end of the war, the Philippine flag was hoisted signalling the recognition of Philippine independence.\\nTHE PEOPLE\\nThe Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million as of May 2000 (with a projected population of 88.7 million for 2007), and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture.\\nThe Filipino character is actually a little                                    bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan                                    or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos                                    are famous for, is said to be taken from Malay                                    forefathers. The close family relations are                                    said to have been inherited from the Chinese.                                    The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced                                    Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality                                    is a common denominator in the Filipino character                                    and this is what distinguishes the Filipino.                                    Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not                                    the only, English-proficient Oriental people                                    today.

Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.\\nSome 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain\\'s lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian denominations and Buddhist.\\nThe country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the people of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.\\nHospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life, in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.\\nEthnic Groups: 91.5% Christian Malay, 4% Muslim Malay ,1.5% Chinese and 3% other.\\nCULTURE AND ARTS\\nThe major cultural agencies of government are the Cultural Center of the Philippines , the National Historical Institute , the National Museum, The National Library , the Records Management and Archives Office, and the Commission on the Filipino Language . The Heads of these cultural agencies are all ex-officio members of the NCCA Board and all except the Commission on the Filipino Language are together under the National Commission on Culture and Arts .\\nCLIMATE\\nThe Philippines has a tropical climate with relatively abundant rainfall and gentle winds. There are three pronounced seasons: the wet or rainy season from June to October, the cool, dry season from November to February, and the hot, dry season from March to May.\\nTemperature in Manila ranges from 21°C to 32°C with a 27°C average. The coolest month is January and the warmest is May. Both temperature and humidity levels reach the maximum in April and May, but these are generally good months for aquasports and mountain trekking. Some of the most colorful festivals are held during these months. More info\\nLANGUAGE\\nTwo official languages --- Filipino and English.

English is also widely used and is the medium of instruction in higher education.\\nEight (8) major dialects spoken by majority of the Filipinos: Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon or Ilonggo, Bicolano, Waray, Pampango, and Pangasinense.\\nFilipino is that native language which is used nationally as the language of communication among ethnic groups . Like any living language, Filipino is in a process of development through loans from Philippine languages and non-native languages for various situations, among speakers of different social backgrounds, and for topics for conversation and scholarly discourse.

      "[0.00033853384148193965, 'COUNTRY NAME : Republic of the Philippines\\nFORM OF GOVERNMENT : Democratic\\nCAPITAL : Manila\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe visitor to Metro Manila commonly sees the Philippines as the most westernized   of Asian countries and in many ways, it is. But there is also a rich underlay   of Malay culture beneath the patina of Spanish and American heritage. National   cultural life is a happy marriage of many influences, as the indigenous Malay   culture is assimilated and adapted to different strains in a practice typical   of Malay temperament. An upsurge of Philippine nationalism stimulated a desire   to preserve the ancient heritage without restricting its openness to foreign   artistic influence.\\nThe Philippines is an archipelago of 7,107 islands. It stretches from the south of China to the northern tip of Borneo. The country has over a hundred ethnic groups and a mixture of foreign influences which have molded a unique Filipino culture.\\nBefore the Spanish explorers came, Indo-Malays and Chinese merchants had settled   here. In 1521, the Spaniards, led by Ferdinand Magellan, discovered the islands.   The Spanish conquistadores established a colonial government in Cebu in 1565.   They transferred the seat of government to Manila in 1571 and proceeded to   colonize the country. The Filipinos resisted and waged Asia\\'s first nationalist   revolution in 1896. On June 12, 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines   independent from Spain and proclaimed himself president. After ruling for 333   years, the Spaniards finally left in 1898 and were replaced by the Americans   who stayed for 48 years. On July 4, 1946, the Americans recognized Philippine   independence.\\nThe Philippines is the third largest English-speaking country in the world.   The country is divided into three geographical areas: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.   It has 17 regions,   81 provinces, 118 cities, 1,510 municipalities , and 41,995 barangays. (Barangay   - The smallest political unit into which cities and municipalities in the Philippines   are divided. It is the basic unit of the Philippine political system. It consists   of less than 1,000 inhabitants residing within the territorial limit of a city   or municipality and administered by a set of elective officials, headed by   a barangay chairman or punong barangay). Data as of December 2006.\\nGEOGRAPHY\\nThe Philippine archipelago is geographically located between latitude (approximately)   4o23\\'N   and  21o25\\'N and longitude (approximately) 112oE and 127oE.   It is composed of 7,107 islands, with a land area of 299,764 sq.kilometers.   Its length measures 1,850 kilometers, starting from the point near the southern   tip of Taiwan and ending close to northern Borneo. Its breadth is about 965   kilometers. The Philippine coastline adds up to 17,500 km. Three prominent   bodies of water surround the archipelago: the Pacific Ocean on the east, the   South China Sea on the west and north, and the Celebes Sea on the south. This   position accounts for much of the variations in geographic, climatic and vegetational   conditions in the country.\\nThe topography of the bigger islands - particularly Luzon and Mindanao - is characterized by alluvial plains, narrow valleys, rolling hills and high mountains. The highest mountains are found in Mindanao and Luzon, with the altitudes varying from 1,790 to 3,144 meters. Most of the smaller islands are mountainous in the interior, surrounded by narrow strips of discontinuous flat lowlands which constitute the coastal rims. The shorelines of both large and small islands are irregular.\\nThe Philippines\\' fertile land accounts for the more than 900 species of orchids representing 100 genera that have been found. The sampaguita is the national flower.\\nAmong the country\\'s fauna are some endangered species like the Philippine   Eagle, the tarsier, and the mouse deer.\\nMetro Manila is strategically located in the middle of Luzon, on the eastern coast of Manila Bay and at the mouth of the Pasig River, sprawled over an area of 626 sq.km. Manila sits in the middle of a swampy deltaic plain formed by accumulated sedimentary deposits from the Pasig River and other streams.\\nThe city is between the bay to the west, the highlands to the east, and Laguna de Bay to the southeast. Most of its densely populated areas are found along the Pasig River running across the metropolis dividing it into two sections - the north and the south.\\nTIME ZONE:\\nGMT + 8 hours. Check out the Philippine Standard Time\\nCAPSULE HISTORY\\nBefore the Spanish conquistadores came, a thriving community flourished on the banks of the Pasig River. It was called \"Maynilad\", after the nilad plant whose star-shaped flowers clustered in abundance along the low-lying river banks.\\nThe lord of the riverside kingdom was Raha Sulayman who held court on the south side of the river while his uncle, Lakandula, ruled on the north side. The Spaniards were set on conquering this community. After the savage Battle of Bangkusay, where they overtook the natives with their awesome firepower, the Spaniards conquered Manila. In this Battle, Sulayman was killed.\\nRealizing its strategic position as a trading center and military outpost, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, head of the Spanish expedition, promptly declared Manila the capital of the new colonies won by Spain. On June 24, 1571, Manila was declared the capital of the entire achipelago. Delighted by this conquest, the King of Spain awarded the city a coat of arms and the grandiose title: \"The Noble and Ever Loyal City\". Soon, Manila became a replica of a European medieval city. There were churches, palaces and city halls built in the Spanish baroque style. Work began on building a wall around the city to keep the pirates and Moros at bay. It took 150 years to finish this wall. The end result was an astounding eight foot-thick, three mile-long wall, with two forts and a bastion, 370 guns in place, manned by a force of 5,000 men and 10,000 reserves. This walled city became known as Intramuros.\\nBeautiful as it was, Intramuros stood as a perfect illustration of the discrimination at that time against the natives called Indios. Although it was built by Indio workers and Chinese artisans, Intramuros was meant only for the clergy and the Spanish nobility. The natives could not enter except to work as servants. Outside the walls, in the arabales or suburbs, lived the Indios, the Chinese and other foreigners. The diversity of trade and culture in the suburbs made it alive and interesting. Tondo, Binondo, Sta. Cruz, and Quiapo bustled with commerce. These places were home to the merchants, carpenters, blacksmiths, carriage makers, masons, and other artisans.\\nOver the centuries, the Spanish rule was occasionally threatened by attacks from the sea and by internal uprisings. The Chinese, Dutch and British all tried to lay siege on Manila but were unsuccessful. But the 1880\\'s saw the birth of a reform movement led by Marcelo H. Del Pilar, Lopez Jaena and Jose Rizal (the national hero). This reform movement ultimately led to a revolution and by 1898, the days of the Castilian rule were numbered. The most lasting legacy of the Spanish rule was the Catholic religion which makes the Philippines the only Christian nation in Asia.\\nBut as soon as the Spaniards left, the Americans took over. 1902 was the beginning of the American era, a period characterized by the expansion of public education, advances in health care and the introduction of democratic government. The outbreak of war in the Pacific in 1941 disrupted American rule. Manila was declared an open city and the Americans withdrew their defenses. For three years, Manila was occupied by the Japanese imperial forces. Life at that time was made difficult by strict Japanese military rule. When the American troops entered Manila to liberate it, they had to bomb the city to dislodge the tenacious Japanese. Manila was devastated.\\nOn July 4, 1946, a year after the end of the war, the Philippine flag was hoisted signalling the recognition of Philippine independence.\\nTHE PEOPLE\\nThe Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million as of May 2000 (with a projected population of 88.7 million for 2007), and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks.

CONDE\\nContinue reading the main story\\nMANILA — Sometime in the late 1970s, Tony Tan Caktiong, the owner of a small ice cream parlor in a lower- middle-class neighborhood here, learned that an American hamburger chain was coming to invade the Philippines.\\nWorried that his store, which had just started selling burgers, might get floored by the new competition, Tan Caktiong, a Filipino of Chinese descent, took a leaf from the Chinese military tactician Sun Tzu: he flew to the United States to know his future enemy.\\nWhen he returned to the Philippines a few weeks later, Tan Caktiong brought with him an arsenal of ideas on how to fortify his store, called Jollibee, to face the newcomer.\\nWhat followed was a classic tale of survival that quickly became a Filipino legend that is now being retold in the country\\'s business schools, often with a tinge of nationalistic pride directed against the U.S. burger chain in question, McDonald\\'s.\\nTan Caktiong had no choice but to reinvent Jollibee.\\n\"He was told that either he sold Jollibee to McDonald\\'s or be its franchise holder here. \\'They will eat you alive,\\' his friends told him,\" said John Victor Tence, vice president for corporate and human resources of Jollibee Foods.\\nDescribed by friends as self-effacing and frugal but determined, Tan Caktiong told his friends, \"I have a third choice: I can fight McDonald\\'s.\"\\nAnd fight he did, using as weapons the very things that made McDonald\\'s successful: the mascot, the colorful uniforms of the crew, their cheerful greetings, French fries, fried chicken and a burger aimed at Filipino tastes and priced much lower.\\n\"He brought the standards of Jollibee notches higher, at least on par with McDonald\\'s, by basically copying what McDonald\\'s was doing,\" Tence said.\\nBy the time McDonald\\'s put up its first store here, in 1981, it no longer offered anything new. Jollibee, meanwhile, was already prepared, having opened nine branches and started an aggressive marketing campaign. Jollibee entered the list of the top 1,000 corporations in the Philippines that same year. By 1984, it was in the Top 500 list and dominated the local fast-food market.\\nThe Philippines, The Economist magazine wrote in 2002, \"is a huge embarrassment to McDonald\\'s,\" citing a Taylor Nelson Sofres study showing that Jollibee was the \"most often visited\" fast-food restaurant in the country.\\nJollibee had grown so big and confident that, in 1986, it opened its first store overseas, in Taiwan. It was a sign of things to come. In 1998, Jollibee would encroach on McDonald\\'s home territory, opening its first U.S. store in Daly City, California, which has a large Filipino population.\\nToday, Jollibee has more than 500 stores in the Philippines and 25 in other countries, selling more than half a million burgers every day. McDonald\\'s has about 250 outlets in the Philippines, according to Cerwin Eviota, a public relations consultant for the chain.\\nAside from the United States and Taiwan, Jollibee also has stores in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Saipan and Brunei, as well as in Vietnam, where sales grew 46 percent in the first quarter of 2004.\\nJollibee Foods also embarked on an ambitious expansion program domestically and overseas, and not just for its flagship stores.\\nIt bought Chowking, a popular Filipino fast-food chain that sells mainly Chinese food; it is now the dominant Chinese fast-food chain in the Philippines and has even entered the Indonesian market. Jollibee also acquired the local franchise for Delifrance, a French café and bakery chain.\\nIt also bought Greenwich, a small pizza chain that has grown larger in the Philippines than another American giant, Pizza Hut. And it acquired Yonghe King, a fast-food chain in China. All in all, Jollibee Foods has 1,186 stores in nine countries, including 120 in China.\\nJollibee is now the largest Filipino food company, with sales of 21.7 billion pesos, or $397 million, in 2004, up 13.7 percent from a year earlier. Sales in the first quarter of 2005 were up almost 20 percent.\\nYonghe King sales in China grew 27 percent in the first quarter. All its other stores are doing well, with Delifrance increasing its sales by almost 32 percent in the first quarter of 2005.\\nThe value of Jollibee stock has grown 28 percent since last year, and it was the best-performing domestic stock on the Philippine stock exchange.\\n1\\n', 14]\n",

I am particularly excited that Kimi Dora almost made the list.  I am not a big fan of Joyce Bernal but I just love Eugene Domingo and Chris Martinez.  Chris Martinez I believe wrote Kimi Dora as well as Here Comes the Bride.  However, I think 100 was his best film and I just hope you got to see and maybe it would have been part of the list (as watching the movie is a requirement for it to be on the list).\\nThe brilliance of having a melodramatic topic for a movie (100) but injecting the right kind of humor on some scenes will make Chris Martinez one of the best in the industry in the coming years.  I\\'ve watched 3 of the films he wrote and directed(I am not sure if he did more) and I enjoyed every single one of them.\\nI am sure, this comment will raise some eyebrows with some readers.  I know, more often than not, comedies are not given the same share of, for hte lack of a better word, respect as the heavy drama counterparts.  Although I always believe that it is easy to make people cry but it\\'s really hard to make people laugh.  And for a Chris Martinez, who can make a full movie house laugh out loud in chorus is nothing short of amazing.  By this time, I know some of the eyebrows of some readers reached the tip of their widow\\'s peak however, I think I have to put a disclaimer that this opinion is very personal.  I have not met Chris Martinez and he did not pay me to write this.  These set of words is coming from a guy who was born early 90s and learned to appreciate movies in the mid 2000 already, where Lino Brocka and all those great filmmakers in the 70s and 80s are no longer making films.  I\\'m part of the generation who, some would qualify, as unlucky enough to catch some of these titles in the cinemas.

Described as the most beloved institution in the country, fiesta is the embodiment of everything held dear by the Filipino people – pageantry, drama, humour, friendship, religious piety and earthy revelry.\\nThe roots of the fiesta reach back to the early years of Spanish rule, when the friars coaxed their converts within hearing distance of the church bells with the pomp and ceremony of organized celebrations.\\xa0 The Christian aspects of fiesta thinly veil ancient beliefs pagan celebration were altered rather than outlawed, the dances and rituals offered to saints, instead of heathen gods.\\xa0 The three days frenzy of Ati-Atihan in Kalibo on the island of Panay and the extreme of flagellation and crucifixion endured by penitents at Holy Week in Manila, San Fernando and Antipolo, are among the more exotic and famous of the fiestas.

Solo estuve en \"Metro Manila\" que comprende 15 ciudades con 16 millones de habitantes, de una población total de 90 millones. No pude visitar las bellezas naturales en el norte y en el sur.\\nEn 1564 comenzó la colonización española que duró más de 300 años. Para que los frailes pudiesen identificar a los nativos, les dieron a escoger de una lista de nombres castellanos, que aún hoy perduran en los filipinos y en las calles; pero el castellano no logró sustituir a los dialectos indígenas. Manila floreció con los galeones que intercambiaban especies y mercancías chinas por el oro y plata mexicanos desde el puerto de Acapulco, pero el lucrativo intercambio desapareció a fines del siglo XVIII.\\nHoy casi nadie habla castellano y la influencia norteamericana es evidente\\nLa derrota española en la guerra hispano-cubana-americana provocó la pérdida de Cuba y las Filipinas en 1898. Durante la colonia de EE UU se implantó el inglés como lengua oficial enseñada en las escuelas. La ocupación norteamericana fue interrumpida por la invasión japonesa durante la II Guerra Mundial; en 1945, Manila fue destruida por el bombardeo de MacArthur frente a la fuerte resistencia nipona, causando 150.000 muertes de civiles. Los filipinos alcanzaron la soñada independencia en 1946.\\nHoy, casi nadie habla castellano, aunque la élite educada lo domina. La lengua principal es el tagalo (uno de los 165 dialectos existentes) con palabras españolas mezcladas que muchos filipinos creen que son parte del idioma vernáculo. El inglés es el segundo idioma, pero no todos lo hablan.\\nCasi todo lo relacionado con el comer es en castellano: mesa, silla, cubiertos, cuchillo, cuchara, tenedor, servilleta, merienda, vaso y botella. \"Platos\" típicos son el lechón, el adobo (de cerdo y pollo), la caldereta (de cabra) y el arroz caldo; se conservan tapas, puchero, leche, repollo, calabaza, harina (sin h) y jamón (con h), pan y mantequilla, carne, calamares, patatas, chocolate, limonada, azúcar (asúkal) y manzana, pera, uvas, papaya, melón y pomelo. Partes del hogar y los muebles continúan siendo llamados puerta, ventana, cama, sofá, aparador y escaparate. Los meses y los días de la semana son en castellano. Lo mismo ocurre en la ropa: pantalón, blusa, zapatos, camiseta, calzoncillo, sombrero, corbata y algunas palabras antiguas como chinelas y saya. También las familiares (padre y madre, abuelo y abuela, compadre y comadre), partes del cuerpo (cabeza, mano, brazo, lengua), oficios (carpintero, barbero, dentista, mecánico, basurero, juez, sastre, capitán), religión (iglesia, católico, Dios, Virgen María), negocios y servicios (botica, banco, hacienda, cementerio), animales (toro, caballo, pato) y flores (rosas, jazmín).\\nSe pide \"permiso\", una característica nacional es el \"amor propio\", los hombres tienen \"queridas\" pero no se usa \"queridos\", y hay \"guapos\" pero no \"guapas\" (a pesar de la aparente inequidad de género ha habido dos \"presidentas\"). Si uno está \"aburrido\" se va a una \"fiesta\", toma un \"café\" o una \"cerveza\" San Miguel y se despide con un \"adiós\".\\nEn la ciudad colonial (\"Intramuros\") perduran las murallas casi intactas, el Fuerte de Santiago que domina el río, la iglesia de San Agustín (la más antigua del país), el manuscrito del héroe nacional José Rizal El último adiós y una mansión reconstruida (Casa Manila) con bellísimos muebles antiguos de rejilla y estupenda cerámica española. El Museo Ayala tiene la mejor colección de oro que he visto, y el Museo del Pueblo Filipino exhibe los restos del galeón San Diego hundido en 1600 con un centenar de piezas de vajilla española.\\nFilipinas es una sociedad multiétnica, gran parte de la población es de descendencia china, y muchos son ricos. Los dos hoteles más lujosos son el Sangri-la y el Mandarín. Chinatown se extiende dos kilómetros, flanqueada por dos puertas chinas, y atiborrada de establecimientos de todo tipo. El enorme cementerio chino está lleno de \"apartamentos\", muchos de dos pisos, con aire acondicionado, cocina y baño. Para el día de difuntos los familiares van en la víspera, duermen en el piso superior, y al día siguiente preparan sus comidas y juegan al dominó o al majong frente a las tumbas de sus antepasados.\\nLa influencia norteamericana es evidente, la comida rápida (McDonald\\'s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin Donuts) ya está creando obesidad. El pasatiempo en Manila es el malling, pues el calor es abrumador y los malls tienen aire refrigerado. En Makati (el centro de negocios y de los grandes hoteles), el Greenbelt Mall se compone de cinco edificios inmensos, conectados por jardines tropicales, tiendas de marcas famosas y docenas de restaurantes.\\nEl tráfico en Manila es horroroso (peor que en Ciudad México). Una distancia corta que el domingo se recorre en taxi en 20 minutos, toma una hora y media durante días de trabajo. El vehículo más popular es el jeepney, un híbrido con frente de jeep y alargado atrás para dar cabida a 16 pasajeros. Hay un tren elevado, siempre abarrotado, y los buses grandes son escasos.\\nLos filipinos son muy amables y corteses. Un gesto común de bienvenida es llevarse la mano derecha al corazón o una pequeña reverencia. A pesar de sus penurias lucen risueños y aman las \"fiestas\" y la música.\\nCarmelo Mesa-Lago es catedrático de Economía y Estudios Latinoamericanos en la Universidad de Pittsburgh (Estados Unidos).\\n* Este artículo apareció en la edición impresa del Martes, 18 de octubre de 2011\\nArchivado en:\\n', 10]\n",

He doesn\\'t need a bank account to retrieve the money.\\nMore than 5.5 million Filipinos now use their cellphones as virtual wallets, making the Philippines a leader among developing nations in providing financial transactions over mobile networks.\\nMobile banking services, which are also catching on in Kenya and South Africa, enable people who don\\'t have bank accounts to transfer money easily, quickly and safely. It\\'s spreading in the developing world because mobile phones are much more common than bank accounts.\\nThe system is particularly useful for the 8 million Filipinos — 10% of the country\\'s citizens — who work overseas and send money home, like Dennis\\' mother, Anna Tiangco. Previously, she sent money via a bank wire transfer, which costs $2.50 and takes two days to clear. The cellphone method costs only 13 cents, and is nearly instantaneous.\\n\"The good thing here is, wherever my children are, they can text me and I can send money immediately,\" she said by telephone from Hong Kong.\\nConsumers also can store limited amounts of money on their cellphones to buy things at stores that participate in the network — although this practice isn\\'t yet widespread in the Philippines.\\nMany more Filipinos use their phones to send airtime values called \"loads\" to prepaid subscribers. A parent, for example, can send a 60-peso load to replenish a child\\'s cellphone, charged to the parent\\'s account.\\nWhile Japanese and South Korean consumers have been using cellphones as virtual wallets for several years, those systems use a computer chip implanted in handset that allows people to buy things by waving the phone in front of a sensor. The Philippine system relies on simple text messages, which cost just 2 cents to send.\\nThe 41 million cellphone users in the Philippines are avid texters. The electronic connections have fostered a culture of quick greetings and forwarded jokes. Text messages also played a key role in mobilizing crowds that fueled the 2001 \"people power\" revolt that ousted President Joseph Estrada.\\nThe Philippines\\' two biggest mobile service providers, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications, have harnessed this penchant for text messaging to enable consumers to enter the world of e-commerce.\\nTapping into the cash flow from overseas Filipinos — who sent home $12.7 billion last year — Globe and Smart forged partnerships with foreign mobile providers and banks, as well as with local banks and merchants, to create a network that allows users to send and receive cash internationally.\\nWhen Anna Tiangco wants to send cash home, for example, she goes to a branch of her local provider, Hong Kong CSL Ltd., where a clerk credits her cellphone with the amount she has brought with her. She then transfers the money to family members via text messages — in essence instructing her providers to deduct money from her balance to the recipients she indicates.\\nIf a cellphone loaded with cash values is lost or stolen, the money can\\'t be tapped as long as the personal identification number isn\\'t revealed. Control over the funds can be restored with a replacement SIM card from either mobile provider.\\nThe system was \"built for remote payments and for the unbanked markets,\" said Rizza Maniego Eala, president of G-Xchange, Globe\\'s subsidiary in charge of its G-Cash money transfer service.\\nEala said her company\\'s 500,000 G-Cash users transfer about $100 million monthly, but she declined to say how many transactions involve remittances from overseas.\\nSmart offers a slightly different money transfer system, used by about 5 million Filipinos, that links cash or a debit card to a cellphone.\\nUsers load up their phones with money via text messages. The card, which does not require a bank account, can then be used to purchase goods in establishments that accept MasterCard, or to withdraw cash from an ATM machine.\\nSmart Communications spokesman Ramon Isberto said each time the recipient spends the money, the sender receives a transaction message. That allows the sender to see how the funds are used.\\n\"The added value there now is that Filipinos overseas have greater control over their funds. Believe me, that is important to them,\" he said.\\nSmart and UAE\\'s leading telecommunications operator, Etisalat, have agreed to provide money transfer service to hundreds of thousands of Filipinos in the Middle East. Smart also will soon launch a remittance system in Bahrain in partnership with MTC-Vodafone and Ahli United Bank there, and Banco de Oro in the Philippines, Isberto said.\\n\"The bank products remain clearly bank products. We positioned ourselves as an enabler for banks and other financial institutions to provide products and services to their customers in ways they would otherwise not have been able to,\" he said.\\nAside from transferring cash and making purchases, both Globe and Smart also allow their users to pay bills with their phones. Anna Tiangco said she pays her family\\'s electric bills in San Miguel from Hong Kong via text messages, just like she sends money.\\n\"Even if we are far apart, it\\'s like we are still together,\" she said. \"This is like my wallet now.\"\\nCopyright 2007 The Associated Press.

      "[0.0002478197509482816, 'What Is the National Flower of France?\\nBy Sue McCarty\\nThe iris, or fleur-de-lis, is the national flower of France.\\nThe iris is France\\'s national flower, and a stylized version of the flower is used for the country\\'s insignia and national emblem. The iris, or fleur-de-lis, has been used to represent French royalty since the 13th century and is said to signify perfection, light and life. In heraldic designs used by the French monarchy, the three petals also represented wisdom, faith and chivalry.\\nHistory\\nFleur-de-lis\\nThe iris flower was named for the Greek goddess Iris, who was a messenger on Mount Olympus. The flower was the symbol of idea and message in ancient Greece. Men planted an irises on the graves of their wives and lovers in ancient Greece as a tribute to the goddess, who led the souls of women to the Elysian fields.\\nThe iris was also adopted by the ruling class of the Roman Empire and eventually came to symbolize the predominantly Catholic French kingdom. While the French did not formally adopt the fleur-de-lis as a heraldic charge until the 12th century, as an emblem it has been found on coins and seals as early as the 10th century in France, England, Spain and other countries.\\nIdentification\\nThis brilliant iris is only one of more than 200 varieties.\\nThe primary features of the iris are the three petals. The central one stands straight, while the other two curve in either direction away from it. The three petals are often referred to as the standards, and the three outer sepals are called the falls.\\nThere are more than 200 varieties of iris flowers in a large range of colors, from pure white to a deep purple. The plant takes its name from the Greek word for rainbow.\\nReligious Significance\\nFleur-de-lis on a stained glass window in France.\\nDue to the iris\\' three petals, it has been considered representative of the Holy Trinity by the Roman Catholic Church, and is also the special symbol of the Virgin Mary. Because of this religious connotation, the iris has been a worldwide symbol of divine protection for centuries. According to heraldica.org, the flower acquired its strong religious connection through the influence of Saints Bernard and Jerome. Louis VII (1120-1180), one of France\\'s most pious kings, adopted the fleur-de-lis as a symbol of his Christian beliefs.\\nJoan of Arc carried a white banner that featured the fleur-de-lis to let the English know that God was blessing the French troops in their support of Charles VII\\'s successful bid for the French throne in 1429.\\nCultural Significance\\nFleur-de-lis on armor\\nIn the 12th century, either King Louis VI or King Louis VII (sources disagree, reports fleurdelis.com) became the first French king to display the stylized iris on his battle shield. English kings added the fleur-de-lis to their coats of arms to emphasize claims to the French throne, and knights added the symbol to their family insignias. These emblems were embroidered onto woven surcoats worn over a knight\\'s battle armor, coining the term \"coat of arms.\"\\nConsiderations and Legends\\nYellow irises\\nAccording to legend, King Clovis I followed a frightened doe across a river on his way to do battle with the king of Aquitania Alaric near Poitiers, France, in 507. Upon reaching the opposite bank, Clovis picked a wild yellow iris and put it on his helmet as a symbol of his future victory. Since then, kings of France have used the fleur de lis as their emblem, reports heraldica.org. King Louis XII (1460-1515) officially made the fleur-de-lis, or iris, the national French flower and symbol.\\nMisconceptions and Theories\\nYellow fleur-de-lis symbol\\nRecent, unconfirmed theories about the Holy Grail assert that the fleur-de-lis is a symbol of a mythical holy origin of France through a union between a descendant of Mary Magdelene and Jesus Christ and King Meroveus II, who was crowned at age 15 in 448. Despite arguments that the term fleurs-de-lis, also spelled fleur-de-lys, literally translates into \"flower of the lily,\" the Metropolitan Museum of Art claims it probably means the \"flower of Loys.\" This is how the long line of French kings named Louis referred to themselves up until Louis XIII in the mid-1600s. The historical use of a yellow fleur-de-lis as a symbol suggests that the connection is actually to the native wild yellow iris of legend and not the lily.\\nReferences\\n', 159]\n",

During 2016, the current account balance narrowed to its lowest level since the 2008 global financial crisis, but nevertheless mustered a surplus for a 14th consecutive year. International reserves remain at comfortable levels and the banking system is stable.\\nEfforts to improve tax administration and expenditures management have helped ease the Philippines\\' debt burden and tight fiscal situation. The Philippines received investment-grade credit ratings on its sovereign debt under the former AQUINO administration and has had little difficulty financing its budget deficits. However, weak absorptive capacity and implementation bottlenecks have prevented the government from maximizing its expenditure plans. Although it has improved, the low tax-to-GDP ratio remains a constraint to supporting increasingly higher spending levels and sustaining high and inclusive growth over the longer term.\\nEconomic growth has accelerated, averaging 6.1% per year from 2011 to 2016, compared with 4.5% under the MACAPAGAL-ARROYO government; and competitiveness rankings have improved. Although 2016 saw a record year for net foreign direct investment inflows, FDI to the Philippines has continued to lag regional peers, in part because the Philippine constitution and other laws restrict foreign ownership in important activities/sectors - such as land ownership and public utilities.\\nAlthough the economy grew at a faster pace under the AQUINO government, challenges to achieving more inclusive growth remain. Wealth is concentrated in the hands of the rich. The unemployment rate declined from 7.3% to 5.5% between 2010 and 2016 but the jobs are low paying and tedious. Underemployment hovers at around 18% to 19% of the employed. At least 40% of the employed work in the informal sector. Poverty afflicts more than a fifth of the population. More than 60% of the poor reside in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty (about 30%) is more severe - a challenge to raising rural farm and non-farm incomes. Continued efforts are needed to improve governance, the judicial system, the regulatory environment, the infrastructure, and the overall ease of doing business.\\n2016 saw the election of President Rodrigo DUTERTE, who has pledged to make inclusive growth and poverty reduction his top priority. DUTERTE believes that illegal drug use, crime and corruption are key barriers to economic development among the lower income class. This administration wants to reduce the poverty rate to 14% and graduate the economy to upper-middle income status by the end of President DUTERTE’s term in 2022. Key themes under the government’s Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda include continuity of macroeconomic policy, tax reform, higher investments in infrastructure and human capital development, and improving competitiveness and the overall ease of doing business. The administration has vowed to address spending bottlenecks and is pushing for congressional passage of a Comprehensive Tax Reform Program to help finance more aggressive infrastructure and social spending, starting in 2018. The government also supports relaxing restrictions on foreign ownership, except for land.\\n', 183]\n",

We celebrate Philippine cinema with our list of 10 must-watch local flicks.\\nShare Tweet Pin 0  Comment\\nAll best-of lists are dangerous. They are invitations for condemnation.\\nWe love them because they fulfill our hankering for order in the glut of things. We love them because they provide a measure, even if a crude one, for our taste. And we love them because they are a concentrated form of validation (\"Of course that should be in this list!\") and drama (\"How dare they include this and not that? Who does he think he is?\").\\nOf course, there will always be someone who will soon decry that something else important is missing. At best, they are something that can spark an impassioned debate among film buffs.\\nI have not seen all Filipino films, but I have seen my fair share of what are considered the best of what local cinema can offer.\\xa0\\xa0 In coming up with this list, I arrived at a haphazard criteria–that I will only select something that I have actually watched, and that something must have been able to engage me in a deeper way than most films I have seen.\\nBut first I got some help. Because I remember Cinemalaya\\'s Ed Cabagnot once telling me that he considers Eddie Romero\\'s Ganito Kami Noon Paano Kayo Ngayon as probably one of the best Filipino films ever made–simply because it tasked itself to answer the question: who or what is a Filipino? I wondered what other critics had to say about what is the best, and so I cornered a few of the country\\'s top film critics.\\nFrancis Cruz of the popular film blog Lessons From the School of Inattention , goes straight to his choices: \"Lav Diaz\\'s Batang West Side and Raya Martin\\'s Independencia. But if there\\'s one which I think is ripe for rediscovery, it would be Joey Gosiengfiao\\'s Bedspacers.\"\\nThe Philippine Daily Inquirer\\'s Rito Asilo agonized over it: \"This is a hard decision... But I choose Magnifico. Despite its tragic finale, Maryo J. de los Reyes\\' stirring 2003 drama nonetheless leaves strands of hope for the viewers.\"\\nWriter Luis Katigbak said that a few titles came to mind: \"There\\'s Luis Quirino\\'s short film Pasakalye, a darkly humorous little road trip of a film. There\\'s Quark Henares\\' Keka, which I love for the sheer irreverent fun it offers: dance number, death scenes, and all. There\\'s Aureaus Solito\\'s Pisay, widely considered to not be his best film \\xa0but which I love for reasons nostalgic and sentimental and literary).\"\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\nBusinessworld\\'s Noel Vera raves about two films: \"Mario O\\'Hara\\'s Kastilyong Buhangin stars Nora Aunor and Lito Lapid as a vehicle for both. I can only describe it as a cross between George Cukor\\'s A Star is Born and Ringo Lam\\'s Prison on Fire.\"\\nWhich proves my point: the untidy richness of lists lies in the fact that, collating opinions from the film-struck, no one really agrees with another. And that is something to cherish. In the end, I had to come up with my list–knowing full well my own criteria, and knowing that I wanted to touch on things not usually considered for lists like this, and that included a survey of all genres, as well as a consideration of short films, documentaries, animated films, independent films you don\\'t often see in the cineplex, and even the unabashedly commercial. And so here we go with my own take, whether I \"get it or not.\"\\n10. Kailangan Kita\\nDirected by Rory Quintos for Star Cinema, 2002\\nThis film proves that the unabashedly commercial–something created foremost as a money-making vehicle for movie stars–does not have to be ineptly made, even when it goes through the formula designed to induce Kleenex tears, set to the soundtrack of a popular love song. Quintos\\' take on the growing love affair between an arrogant U.S.-bred city boy (Aga Muhlach) and a snippy country lass (Claudine Barreto) is also a gorgeous paean to Bicolandia and its searingly hot cuisine. Its use of food and color to signal the growing romance between the two characters is at once breathtaking, hunger-inducing, and subtle. The ending, of course, is a let-down of corniness that sends shivers down our spine, reminding us at the end that this is still a Star Cinema film–but for a while there, we were enchanted.\\n9. Libingan\\nDirected by Ramon del Prado for Tuldok Animation, 2007\\nA little girl from the city goes home to the province with her mother, meets some bullies who steals her cellphone, and gets led to a nearby forest where she has the biggest encounter of all–with primeval beings that spring straight from our forgotten folklore. That this is all told in whimsical animation reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki is incredible. The Philippines is not quite known for its animated films–and what few that came, Gerry Garcia\\'s Isko: Adventures in Animasia (1995) and Robert Quilao\\'s Dayo (2008) did not exactly gain a huge following. Mr. Del Prado may be the future game changer for Filipino animation.\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n8. Ang Lihim ni Antonio\\nDirected by Joselito Altarejos for Viva Digital and Beyond the Box, 2008\\nThere\\'s no question about it: the subgenre of queer cinema is here to stay. They make too much money, which has led to quickie filmmaking cashing in on the trend, giving us films that are sometimes precious (Cris Pablo\\'s Boylets) or atrocious (Joel Lamangan\\'s Walang Kawala). Altarejo\\'s second queer film–a tragedy involving a boy, his mother, and his uncle–tapped into the well of queer unconscious and became perhaps the most popular film of its genre. Of course we\\'ve had groundbreaking–and perhaps even better made–gay films before. Contributions by Brocka (Ang Tatay Kong Nanay), Mel Chionglo (Sibak), Danny Zialcita (T-Bird at Ako), Gil Portes (Miguel/Michelle), Carlitos Siguion-Reyna (Ang Lalake sa Buhay ni Selya), and even the documentaries of Nick Deocampo (Oliver) easily spring to mind. But Antonio is a vivid experience because it is also both a story of growing up and coming out. That it is also sexually explicit adds to its notoriety. It ends with what many consider to be needless tragedy, but if you think about it, it may be the filmmaker giving us a necessary disapproving shake of the head, as if he\\'s saying, \"Sure, you find all these sexy now\"–and then pulls the rug right off our unsuspecting feet. Genius.\\n7. Bata Bata Paano Ka Ginawa?\\nDirected by Chito S. Rono for Star Cinema, 1998\\nI can\\'t believe that there was a once-upon-a-time when a Star Cinema imprimatur was a seal of \"fearless\" filmmaking. Remember Eskapo? Remember Ligaya ang Itawag Mo sa Akin (the Reyna Films-produced flick that it distributed)? Remember this brilliant adaptation of Lualhati Bautista\\'s acclaimed novel of a single mother coming to terms with the macho culture that surrounds her? Vilma Santos is a different revelation in this film–she is both dramatic and comic, and the result is an amazing thespian coup that elevates her. And that potty mouth!\\n6. Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros\\nDirected by Auraeus Solito for Cinemalaya, 2005\\nHow did Auraeus Solito do this? The film is like beautiful magic, where everything is totally unexpected, and yet also the inevitable sum of all its elements. The magic starts, of course, with Michiko Yamamoto\\'s brilliant story of a gay boy living in the slums who must contend with a lovable (but also macho, but…) family of small-time criminals and his incipient romantic fascination for a handsome policeman. Everything is just right in this heartwarming soup of a movie–but we respect it because it does not pull punches in becoming melodramatic. It is all of subtlety, including a heartbreaking ending (a long shot reminiscent of the ending of The Third Man).\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n5. Moral\\nDirected by Marilou Diaz-Abaya for Seven Stars Productions, 1982\\nI still remember the four women in Abaya\\'s feminist drama distinctly–the tomboyish and feisty Lorna Tolentino who is lost and is searching, sometimes in the wrong places, for a thing or a cause to believe in; the garish and ambitious singer Gina Alajar who cannot seem to accept the fact that she cannot sing; the beautiful and self-assured Sandy Andolong who must deal with the fact that her husband has left her for another man; and the put-upon housewife Anna Marin who must deal with an irresponsible husband and a nagging mother-in-law in the middle of the noise of too many children, with another one on the way. This film must have been electric when it was first released, and many years later, its message about the place of women in our world is still very much relevant. Years later, Abaya directed a sequel which replace the principal cast (save for Laurice Guillen as Lorna\\'s mother). It wasn\\'t half-bad, but the original was extraordinarily searing and intelligent–and cemented Abaya\\'s place in the pantheon of local filmmakers.\\n4. Mababangong Bangungot\\n\\xa0\\nDirected by Kidlat Tahimik, 1979\\nThis is the absolute father of all independent films in the country. Eric de Guia, now known as Kidlat Tahimik, casts himself as a man in love with Westernization–but a trip to Paris would soon change him. This is a powerful, if enigmatic, film. Cruz writes of it in his blog: \"It is Tahimik\\'s generosity, his humble simplification of the world\\'s complex worries, that carries Mababangong Bangungot from its low budget imaginings. Tahimik exoticizes his culture without necessarily exploiting it. He also exoticizes European cultures; and in a way, he dons the skin of a curious documentarian, only with more humor and a drawing charm.\"\\n3. Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang\\nDirected by Lino Brocka for Cinemanila, 1974\\nTo choose just one film from Brocka is always an exercise of foolishness. Most people would choose Bona or Maynila sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag or Insiang or Kapit sa Patalim–but Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang speaks to me more for some reason. Brocka famously set about to film this in his old hometown that once ostracized him, wowing them by bringing in big stars–and then slyly makes the town as the very backdrop for his searing tale of small-town hypocrisy. Talk about the ultimate revenge. In it, the young Christopher de Leon becomes our stand-in. He plays the innocent hero who must become his own man as he struggles with the scathing drama of ordinary corruption.\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n2. Kisapmata\\nDirected by Mike de Leon for Bancom Audiovision, 1981\\nHow do you choose just one title from the filmmography of perhaps the most technically proficient–and equally poetic–of Filipino filmmakers? De Leon is like our own version of Stanley Kubrick, in that he is a strange duck of a perfectionist–but manages to make films of totally different genres and make them into gems of cinema. Consider this: he has made tearjerker drama fests (Kung Managarap Ka\\'t Magising), musicals (Kakabakaba Ka Ba?), fraternity thrillers (Batch \\'82), socialist dramas (Sister Stella L.), horror films (Itim), and postmodern biographical films (Bayaning Third World)–and did them all with the panache of a master at the top of his form. With Kisapmata–his indictment of Filipino machismo in this dark (and true life) tale of a policeman father and his murderous hold on his daughter, his wife, and his frustrated son-in-law–he orchestrates all of cinema\\'s techniques (the deliberate editing, the claustrophobic set design, the paranoid cinematography, and the subtle but gripping acting turns by Vic Silayan, Charo Santos, Charito Solis, and Jay Ilagan) to immerse us fully into the dark melodrama. We come away from the film shattered–but enriched.\\n1. Oro Plata Mata\\nDirected by Peque Gallaga for Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, 1982\\nThis is not an unconventional choice. It is almost totally expected. But every time somebody asks me what is my favorite Filipino film, I may hem and haw about the ultimate choice, but in the end this is my answer: Gallaga\\'s Negrense epic of war and loss of innocence. The Philippine Daily Inquirer\\'s Gibbs Cadiz agrees with me: \"I like how it brought a dead era back to life. The final third of the film was a mess, but everything before that was glorious. It reminds me of Visconti\\'s The Leopard–shabbier but the same spirit.\" And Rito Asilo also says: \"Oro Plata Mata eloquently vivifies the destructive reach of war and invasion. Its scope is epic, but it manages to keep its tone and temperament intimate and undeniably Pinoy. It\\'s as relevant now as it was in 1982. But it\\'s downhill from there for Gallaga, whose most recent films (2005\\'s Pinoy Blonde and 2009\\'s Agaton and Mindy) were to say atrocious.\"\\nRunners-up: Trip (directed by Juan Pula a.k.a. Jon Red for Mowelfund, 1993), Himala (directed by Ishmael Bernal for the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, 1982), and Kimi Dora (directed by Joyce Bernal for Spring Films, 2009).\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\nArt by Warren Espejo and movie posters from Video 48.\\n\\xa0\\n', 31]\n",

      "[0.00021165323872981382, 'November 17, 2010\\nThis is the basic text view. SWITCH NOW to the new, more interactive format.\\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributed to the generally free practice of religion.\\nThe government generally respected religious freedom in practice. There was no change in the status of respect for religious freedom by the government during the reporting period. The armed insurgent Muslim group Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) continued to seek greater autonomy. The government and MILF have successfully maintained a ceasefire instituted in July 2009 and have since engaged in peace talks. There was some ethnic, religious, and cultural discrimination against members of the Muslim minority by members of the Christian majority. This, combined with economic disparities, contributed to persistent conflict in certain provinces in the southern part of the country.\\nThe U.S. government discusses religious freedom with the government as part of its overall policy to promote human rights. The embassy actively encouraged the peace process between the government and MILF and maintained active outreach with religious leaders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to engage them in interfaith activities.\\nSection I. Religious Demography\\nThe country has an area of 115,831 square miles and a population of 97.98 million.\\nAccording to the National Statistics Office, approximately 93 percent of the population is Christian. Roman Catholics, the largest religious group, constitute 80 to 85 percent of the total population.\\nIslam is the largest minority religion, and Muslims constitute between 5 and 9 percent of the total population. Most Filipino Muslims are members of various ethnic minority groups. They reside principally on Mindanao and nearby islands. Although most belong to the Sunni branch of Islam, a small number of Shi\\'a Muslims live in the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Zamboanga del Sur in Mindanao. An increasing number of Filipino Muslims have migrated to the urban centers of Manila and Cebu.\\nGroups that together constitute less than 5 percent of the population include Seventh-day Adventists, United Church of Christ, United Methodist, the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, Assemblies of God, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Philippine (Southern) Baptists. Domestically established denominations include the Philippine Independent Church (Aglipayan); the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ); the Members Church of God International; and The Kingdom of Jesus Christ, the Name Above Every Name. Iglesia ni Cristo is the largest indigenous Christian denomination, with approximately 5.6 million members. Christianity is the majority religion among indigenous peoples. Between 12 million and 16 million indigenous persons adhere to Catholicism or Protestantism, often incorporating elements of traditional indigenous belief systems.\\nConversion from Christianity to Islam is most typical among overseas Filipinos while they are living and working in Islamic countries. Many of these converts remain Muslim upon their return to the country and are known collectively as \"Balik Islam\" (return to Islam).\\nSection II. Status of Government Respect for Religious Freedom\\nLegal/Policy Framework\\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributed to the generally free practice of religion. There is no state religion, and the constitution provides for the separation of church and state.\\nThe law required organized religions to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Bureau of Internal Revenue to establish tax-exempt status. There was no penalty for failing to register, and some groups do not. There were no reports of discrimination in the registration system during the reporting period.\\nOn February 18, 2010, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Republic Act 9997, which replaced the Office of Muslim Affairs with the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF). The cabinet-level commission worked to promote the rights of Muslim Filipinos at both the national and local level and supported the implementation of economic, educational, cultural, and infrastructure programs for Muslim Filipino communities. NCMF’s Bureau of Pilgrimage and Endowment will administer the Hajj (annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca). It is also responsible for the administration of awqaf (endowment properties) and institutions and the conduct of activities for the establishment and maintenance of Haji towns, Islamic centers, and other projects. The Presidential Assistant for Muslim Affairs helps coordinate relations with countries that have large Islamic populations and that contributed to Mindanao\\'s economic development and the peace process.\\nThe government permitted religious instruction in public schools with parents’ written consent, provided there was no cost to the government. Based on a traditional policy of promoting moral education, local public schools gave religious groups the opportunity to teach moral values during school hours. Attendance was not mandatory, and the various groups shared classroom space. The government also allowed interested groups to distribute religious literature in public schools. By law public schools must ensure that the religious rights of students are protected. Muslim students are allowed to wear hijab (head coverings), and Muslim girls are not required to wear shorts during physical education classes. In many parts of Mindanao, Muslim students routinely attended Catholic schools from elementary to university level; these students were not required to receive religious instruction.\\nApproximately 14 percent of the Mindanao student population attended madaris (Islamic schools). Government officials estimated there were more than 1,000 madaris operating throughout the country. Of these more than half were located in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). A total of 588 madaris were registered with the NCMF, while 40 were registered with the Department of Education (DepEd). Registration with the NCMF or the DepEd is optional for madaris but, if pursued, can lead to financial assistance from the government. Most madaris did not meet the department\\'s accreditation standards. The DepEd manages financial assistance to the madaris system from local and international sources, and the DepEd\\'s Bureau of Madrasah Education oversees education activities in the ARMM.\\nThe government continued to implement its unified curriculum, designed to integrate madaris into the national education system. In addition to the 40 madaris registered with the DepEd, five madaris in Mindanao were in the process of obtaining operation permits from DepEd at the end of the reporting period. DepEd ordered public elementary schools that had at least 15 Muslim students to begin offering Arabic language instruction and classes on Islamic values, but funding shortfalls and a lack of qualified Arabic teachers limited the reach of this initiative. During the 2009-10 school year, DepEd provided Arabic language instruction and Islamic values education, including textbooks on these subjects, to Muslim students in selected public elementary schools. In August 2009, DepEd began an assistance program with seed funding of $398,992 (Philippine Peso 19 million) to private madaris that have already adopted the standard curriculum on madrasah.\\nThe government\\'s National Ecumenical Consultative Committee (NECCOM) fostered interfaith dialogue among major religious groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, Muslim groups, Iglesia ni Cristo, Aglipayan, and Protestant denominations. Smaller Protestant denominations are represented in the NECCOM through the National Council of Churches of the Philippines and the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, two large networks of Protestant churches and mission groups. NECCOM members met periodically with the President to discuss social and political issues.\\nThe government observes the following religious holidays as national holidays: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter, All Saints\\' Day, Christmas Day, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha.\\nRestrictions on Religious Freedom\\nThe government generally respected religious freedom in practice. There was no change in the status of respect for religious freedom by the government during the reporting period. There were no reports of religious detainees or prisoners in the country. The government does not ban or discourage specific religious groups or religious factions. However, Muslims, who are concentrated in some of the most impoverished provinces, complained that the government had not made sufficient efforts to promote their economic development. Some Muslim religious leaders asserted that Muslims suffered from economic discrimination. The government\\'s campaign against terrorist groups led some human rights NGOs to accuse the police and military of acting with bias in their treatment of Muslims.\\nThe Code of Muslim Personal Laws recognizes Shari\\'a (Islamic law) as part of national law; however, it does not apply in criminal matters, and it applies only to Muslims. Some ulama (Muslim community leaders) argued that the government should allow Islamic courts to extend their jurisdiction to criminal law cases, and some supported the MILF\\'s goal of forming an autonomous region governed in accordance with Islamic law. As in other parts of the judicial system, the Shari\\'a courts suffered from a large number of unfilled positions. All five Shari\\'a district court judgeships and 39 percent of circuit court judgeships remained vacant. Aside from budget restrictions, judicial positions on the Shari\\'a courts were particularly difficult to fill because applicants must be members of both the Shari\\'a bar and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.\\nForced Religious Conversions\\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion.\\nAbuses by Rebel or Foreign Forces or Terrorist Organizations\\nThe government attributed several attacks in the first half of 2009 to MILF separatist rebels who continued to seek political autonomy in Mindanao during the reporting period. In August 2008 after the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on the signing of a government-MILF territorial agreement, an agreement later declared unconstitutional, MILF attacks and subsequent clashes with government troops resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Christian and Muslim residents and the internal displacement in central Mindanao of hundreds of thousands of civilians. The government and MILF instituted a ceasefire in July 2009 and have since engaged in peace talks.\\nDuring the reporting period, the government also attributed a series of attacks, kidnappings, and killings to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), other Islamic militants, and the New People\\'s Army. Religious affiliation was not seen as a relevant factor in these attacks.\\nSporadic bombings of places of worship also occurred during the reporting period. On July 5, 2009, a bomb outside the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Cotabato City killed six and wounded 30 others as they were leaving worship service. On July 7 two more bombs exploded near a cathedral in Jolo City, killing two people and injuring 50. On January 11, 2010, a grenade exploded outside a cathedral in Jolo, Sulu. There were no reported injuries, but the cathedral was slightly damaged. On May 9, 2010, the day prior to national elections, two persons were killed and 12 wounded when a hand grenade was thrown inside a mosque in Pikit, North Cotabato. The Philippine National Police detained suspects affiliated with the ASG in connection with these bombings.\\nImprovements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom\\nMany Muslims welcomed the enactment of the Republic Act 9997, which created and funded the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF). The new commission will expand activities supporting Islamic religious practices and promote the implementation of economic, educational, cultural, and infrastructure programs for Muslim Filipino communities. The new law also mandated the commission\\'s engagement in the following activities: peace process, development of domestic trade and commerce among the members of Muslim Filipino communities, promotion of the halal (a food preparation method in Islamic dietary law), and undertaking studies and establishing ethnographic research centers and museums on Muslim cultures and institutions.\\nThe government promoted interfaith dialogue to build mutual trust and respect among various religious and cultural groups. The Council on Interfaith Initiatives continued to strengthen the government\\'s existing institutional arrangements for interfaith activities by coordinating interfaith programs and initiatives with all government agencies, local government units, and NGO partners. The council receives, approves, and prioritizes programs and project proposals designed to achieve peace and development through interfaith dialogue and cooperation.\\nFrom March 16 to 18, 2010, the country hosted the Special Non-aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development (SNAMMM). During the meeting the 118 member representatives of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) adopted a declaration that called for respect of cultural and religious diversity, promotion of tolerance and interfaith dialogues, and related confidence-building measures among members. The government\\'s Council on Values Formation also spearheaded a parallel meeting on interfaith dialogue on March 16, 2010. During the meeting 70 delegates from various civil society and religious organizations urged the NAM member countries to collaborate in resolving issues that would promote lasting peace and development.\\nSection III. Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom\\nHistorically, Muslims have been alienated socially from the Christian majority, and some ethnic and cultural discrimination against Muslims have been recorded. Young Muslim professionals reported that some employers stereotyped Muslims as being less educated. Some Muslims reported that they had difficulty renting rooms in boarding houses or being hired for retail work if they used their real names or wore distinctive Muslim dress. Therefore, many resorted to adopting Christian pseudonyms and wearing Western clothing.\\nOver the past 60 years, efforts by the dominant Christian population to resettle in traditionally Muslim areas such as Mindanao have fostered resentment among many Muslim residents. Many Muslims viewed Christian proselytizing as another form of resettlement, with the intention of depriving Muslims of their homeland and cultural identity, including their religion.\\nDespite these circumstances, amicable ties among religious communities were common, and many participated in interdenominational efforts to alleviate poverty. The Peacemakers\\' Circle Foundation, a loose coalition of various religious and faith-based groups, continued to focus on building and strengthening interfaith relations through dialogues between Muslims and Christians in selected communities. The Bishops-Ulama Conference in Mindanao continued to bring together Catholic bishops and members of the Ulama League of the Philippines from Mindanao and hold dialogues on addressing local issues of peace and order and intercultural solidarity. Other interfaith groups also promoted peace between persons of different faiths. Leadership of human rights groups, trade union confederations, and industry associations typically represents many religious persuasions.\\nSection IV. U.S. Government Policy\\nThe U.S. government discusses religious freedom with the government as part of its overall policy to promote human rights. U.S. embassy officers regularly met with representatives of all major religious groups to discuss these problems and concerns. In addition the U.S. government actively supported the government\\'s peace process with Muslim insurgents in Mindanao, which has the potential to contribute to peace and a better climate for interfaith cooperation.\\nThe embassy also maintained active outreach with NGOs. The embassy hosted meetings of political and opinion leaders from the Muslim community to discuss the U.S. role in Mindanao. The embassy continued to conduct a wide range of programming to promote interfaith dialogue and peace and to highlight these issues with populations in and around Manila, as well as across Mindanao. In December 2009 the embassy coordinated the visit to the country of the U.S. Special Representative to Muslim Communities, Farah Pandith. The visit included mission briefings, a forum with university students, meetings with NGOs working on Muslim and peace-related issues, interviews with the traditional and Web-based media, meetings with religious leaders and women leaders, and a visit to a local Muslim community to meet government and community leaders.\\nIn February 2009 American Imam Talal Y. Eid, a member of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, visited the country to promote interfaith dialogue and cooperation among interethnic audiences, including women’s groups and youth in Metro Manila and Mindanao.\\nThe estimated total development support of the U.S. government to Mindanao for fiscal year 2009 is $69 million, which composes nearly 60 percent of U.S. government development assistance to the Philippines. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs contributed to promoting peace and fostering an environment for greater religious tolerance. USAID trained more than 470 peace advocates, mostly Muslims from areas in Mindanao affected by conflict and Muslim separatist activities. Almost 30 percent of the trained peace advocates were Muslim women. USAID funds were also used to develop an Islamic-based handbook on conflict resolution for community leaders and to institutionalize community-level alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In the environment sector, USAID supported a special initiative called Al Khalifa (The Steward), an environmental sourcebook based on the Islamic perspective on managing the environment.\\nUSAID programs also provided support to former MILF combatants to encourage their shift from fighting to productive farming and supported the construction of community-based infrastructure projects. With U.S. Department of Defense 1207 funding, USAID completed the Tawi Tawi airport runway improvement project in FY 2009, which will facilitate increased passenger and cargo traffic, thereby supporting economic development in the conflict-affected areas in the Sulu Archipelago. Improvements in transportation infrastructure in the conflict-affected areas are expected to support long-term economic progress and help consolidate peace.\\nUSAID also supported several internship programs for Muslim students. Fourteen Muslim students completed intensive hands-on training in business administration and enterprise development with multi-national companies. Twenty-five young Muslim student leaders were sponsored as interns of the largely Christian-dominated Philippine House of Representatives. The legislative internship program helped policymakers develop a more intimate understanding of Mindanao\\'s Muslim cultures, while simultaneously fostering an appreciation among the interns for the policy-making and legislative processes.\\nIn May and June of 2009, USAID and the embassy\\'s public affairs section coorganized the Cultures Across Mindanao program, which included the participation of more than 200 in- and out-of-school youth from different faiths and ethnic roots across Mindanao. The youth were given training as peace advocates in five-day camps and were provided an interfaith environment where they could interact with one another. USAID assisted 21 madaris last year to adopt the Department of Education’s Standard Madrasah Curriculum and get accreditation and support from the national government. The owners and administrators of the selected madaris were given capacity-building training, such as planning, financial management, school governance, and resource mobilization.\\nWith increased staffing for expanded outreach in Mindanao, the Embassy′s Public Affairs Section funded programs in Mindanao that included high school education, arts preservation, community policing, and a summer youth camp. The Embassy partnered with a local NGO to implement a two-year English Microscholarship Program that initially provided after-school English instruction for three public high schools in July 2009 and expanded to some public high schools in Mindanao in September 2009.\\nIn March 2010 the Embassy partnered with a local university in Jolo to launch a revitalization program for Sulu arts and culture. This activity was designed to allow the inhabitants to engage in productive cultural activities that preserve and protect the indigenous culture. The Embassy also partnered with the National Arts Center to sponsor a 12-day summer camp of creative interaction in modern-urban dance for 50 young dancers from the Sulu Archipelago and Luzon. The participants utilized dance as an art form to foster dialogue about art and other forms of human interaction as tools in conflict resolution, leadership skills building, and building bridges across and within cultures, including both Philippine-U.S. and internal Philippine dialogues.\\nIn This Section:\\n', 210]\n",
      "[0.00020102830797755664, 'Filipino\\nOrientation\\nIdentification. The Republic of the Philippines was named the Filipinas to honor King       Philip the Second of Spain in 1543. The Philippine Islands was the name       used before independence.\\nLocation and Geography. The Republic of the Philippines, a nation of 7,107 islands with a total       area of 111,830 square miles (307,055 square kilometers), is located on       the Pacific Rim of Southeast Asia. Two thousand of its islands are       inhabited. Luzon, the largest island with one-third of the land and half       the population, is in the north. Mindanao, the second largest island, is       in the south. The Philippines are 1,152 miles (1,854 kilometers) long from       north to south. The width is 688 miles (1,107 kilometers). There are no       land boundaries; the country is bordered on the west by the South China       Sea, on the east by the Philippine Sea, on the south by the Celebes Sea,       and on the north by the Luzon Strait, which separates the country from its       nearest neighbor, Taiwan. The closest nations to the south are Malaysia       and Indonesia. Vietnam and China are the nearest neighbors on the mainland       of Asia.\\nThe islands are volcanic in origin. Mount Mayon in southern Luzon erupted       in 2000. Mount Pinatubo in central Luzon erupted in 1991 and 1992. Both       eruptions caused destruction of villages and farms and displaced thousands       of people from their tribal homelands. Because the country is volcanic,       the small islands have a mountainous center with coastal plains. Luzon has       a broad central valley in the northern provinces along the Cagayan River       and plains in the midlands near Manila, the capital. Mindanao and Panay       also have central plains. Northern Luzon has two major mountain ranges:       the Sierra Madres on the eastern coast and the Cordilleras in the center.       The highest peak is Mount Apo in Mindanao at 9,689 feet (2,954 meters).\\nThe weather is hot because of the country\\'s closeness to the       equator. The temperatures are constant except during typhoons. The dry       season is from January to June; the wet season with monsoon rains is from       July to December. Temperatures are cooler in November through January,       dropping below 30 degrees Celsius (85 degrees Fahrenheit). The summer       months of April and May have temperatures in excess of 39 degrees Celsius       (100 degrees Fahrenheit). Typhoons occur from June through November.\\nDemography. The estimated population in July 2000 was eighty-one million. The average       life expectancy is sixty-seven years. Four percent of the population is       over age sixty-five. The most populous area is Metropolitan Manila, where       eight million to ten million people live.\\nLinguistic Affiliation. The official languages are Filipino, which is based on Tagalog with words       from other native languages, and English. Since only 55 percent of       residents speak Filipino fluently, English is used in colleges,       universities, the courts, and the government. The country\\'s seventy       to eighty dialects are derived from Malay languages. Three dialects are of       national importance: Cebuano in the southern islands, Ilocano in the       north, and Tagalog, the language of the National Capital Region. When       Tagalog was chosen as the basis for a national language, Cebuanos refused       to use Filipino. \"Taglish,\" a mixture of Filipino and       English, is becoming a standard language. Filipinos are proud that their       country has the third largest number of English speakers in the world.       Filipino English includes many Australian and British terms. It is a       formal language that includes words no longer commonly used in American       English. Spanish was taught as a compulsory language until 1968 but is       seldom used today. Spanish numbers and some Spanish words are included in       the dialects.\\nPhilippines\\nThe dependence on English causes concern, but since Filipino does not have       words for scientific or technological terms, English is likely to remain       in common use.\\nSymbolism. National symbols have been emphasized since independence to create a       sense of nationhood. The Philippine eagle, the second largest eagle in the       world, is the national bird. Doctor Jose Rizal is the national hero. Rizal       streets and statues of Rizal are found in most towns and cities. Several       municipalities are named for Rizal. The most prominent symbol is the flag,       which has a blue horizontal band, a red horizontal band, and a white       field. The flag is flown with the blue band at the top in times of peace       and the red band at the top in times of war. Flag ceremonies take place       once a week at all governmental offices. Schools have a flag ceremony each       morning. All traffic stops while the flag is being honored. The national       anthem is sung, a national pledge is recited in Filipino, and the provincial hymn is sung.\\nHistory and Ethnic Relations\\nEmergence of the Nation. Early inhabitants are believed to have reached the area over land bridges       connecting the islands to Malaysia and China. The first people were the       Negritos, who arrived twenty-five thousand years ago. Later immigrants       came from Indonesia. After the land bridges disappeared, immigrants from       Indo-China brought copper and bronze and built the rice terraces at Benaue       in northern Luzon. The next wave came from Malaysia and is credited with       developing agriculture and introducing carabao (water buffalo) as draft animals. Trade with China began in the first       century\\nC.E.\\nFilipino ores and wood were traded for finished products.\\nIn 1380, the \"Propagation of Islam\" began in the Sulu       Islands and Mindanao, where Islam remains the major religion. The Muslim       influence had spread as far north as Luzon when Ferdinand Magellan arrived       in 1521 to claim the archipelago for Spain. Magellan was killed soon       afterward when a local chief, Lapu-Lapu, refused to accept Spanish rule       and Christianity. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi landed in the Philippines in       1564 and consolidated Spanish power, designating Manila as the capital in       1572. Roman Catholic religious orders began Christianizing the populace,       but the Sulu Islands and Mindanao remained Muslim. The Spanish governed       those areas through a treaty with the sultan of Mindanao. The Spanish did       not attempt to conquer the deep mountain regions of far northern Luzon.\\nThe occupation by Spain and the unifying factor of Catholicism were the       first steps in creating a national identity. Filipinos became interested       in attaining independence in the middle of the nineteenth century. In the       1890\\'s, the novels of José Rizal, his exile to a remote       island, and his execution by the Spaniards created a national martyr and a       rallying         point for groups seeking independence. Armed attacks and propaganda       increased, with an initial success that waned as Spanish reinforcements       arrived. The Spanish-American War of 1898 and the defeat of the Spanish       fleet in Manila Bay led the Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo to declare       independence from Spain. The United States paid twenty million dollars to       the Spanish for the Philippines under the Treaty of Paris. Aguinaldo did       not accept United States occupation and fought until the Filipino forces       were defeated. In 1902, the Philippines became an American territory, with       the future president William Howard Taft serving as the first territorial       governor. Over the next two decades, American attitudes toward the       Philippines changed and the islands were given commonwealth status in       1933. Independence was promised after twelve years, with the United States       retaining rights to military bases.\\nThe Japanese invaded the Philippines early in 1942 and ruled until 1944.       Filipino forces continued to wage guerrilla warfare. The return of U.S.       forces ended the Japanese occupation. After the war, plans for       independence were resumed. The Republic of the Philippines became an       independent nation on 4 July 1946.\\nThe new nation had to recover economically from the destruction caused by       World War II. Peasant groups wanted the huge land holdings encouraged by       the Spanish and Americans broken apart. In 1955, Congress passed the first       law to distribute land to farmers.\\nFerdinand Marcos governed from 1965 to 1986, which was the longest period       for one president. From 1972 to 1981, he ruled by martial law. Marcos was       reelected in 1982, but a strong opposition movement emerged. When the       leader of the opposition, Benigno Aquino, was murdered after his return       from exile in the United States, his wife, Corazon Aquino, entered the       presidential race in 1986. Marcos claimed victory but was accused of       fraud. That accusation and the withdrawal of United States support for       Marcos led to \"People Power,\" a movement in which the       residents of Manila protested the Marcos regime. The Filipino military       supported Aquino, who was declared president, and the Marcos family went       into exile in Hawaii.\\nThe Aquino years saw the passage of a new constitution with term limits       and the withdrawal of U.S. military forces in 1991, when the government       did not grant a new lease for United States use of military bases.\\nFidel Ramos, the first Protestant president, served from 1991 to 1998.       Major problems included a fall in the value of the peso and the demands of       Muslim groups in Mindanao for self-determination and/or independence. The       government offered self-governance and additional funds, and the movement       quieted.\\nJoseph \"Erap\" Estrada was elected for one six-year term in       1999. The demands of the Muslim rebels escalated, culminating with the       kidnaping of twenty-nine people by the Abu Sayyaf group in April 2000.       Late in the year 2000, impeachment proceedings were brought against       Estrada, who was charged with financial corruption.\\nNational Identity. Filipinos had little sense of national identity until the revolutionary       period of the nineteenth century. The word \"Filipino\" did       not refer to native people until the mid-nineteenth century. Before that       period, the treatment of the islands as a single governmental unit by       Spain and the conversion of the population to Catholicism were the       unifying factors. As a desire for independence grew, a national flag was       created, national heroes emerged, and a national anthem was written. A       national language was designated in 1936. National costumes were       established. The sense of a national identity is fragile, with true       allegiance given to a kin group, a province, or a municipality.\\nEthnic Relations. Ninety-five percent of the population is of Malay ancestry. The other       identifiable group is of Chinese ancestry. Sino-Filipinos are envied for       their success in business. They have maintained their own schools, which       stress Chinese traditions.\\nSeventy to eighty language groups separate people along tribal lines.       Approximately two million residents are designated as cultural minority       groups protected by the government. The majority of those sixty ethnic       groups live in the mountains of northern Luzon. People whose skin is       darker are considered less capable, intelligent, and beautiful.       Descendants of the Negritos tribe are regarded as inferior.\\nUrbanism, Architecture, and the Use of Space\\nThe architecture of the islands shows Spanish influence. Spanish brick       churches built during the colonial era dominate the towns. The churches       are large and different from traditional construction. It is difficult to       imagine how the indigenous population in the seventeenth century was able       to build them.\\nFilipino families enjoy close kin bonds, and extended families             living together are the norm.\\nSeaports and government centers had a larger proportion of Spanish       buildings with wide verandas and tiled roofs. Towns destroyed during the       liberation campaign in World War II, especially in central and northern       Luzon, were rebuilt using wood. Areas of Manila destroyed during World War       II have been restored to their historical Spanish appearance. Newer       buildings in Manila range from standard multistory offices to       Western-style gated housing areas for the affluent, to tenements and       shacks.\\nTraditional houses in rural areas are nipa huts constructed of bamboo and roofed with leaves from palm trees or       corrugated metal. Cinder blocks are the most commonly building material       used. The blocks are plastered and painted on the inside and outside when       funds permit. Plasterers add decorative touches to the exterior. Older       houses have a \"dirty\" open-air kitchen for food preparation.       Newer, larger houses designate a room as a dirty kitchen in contrast to       the \"clean\" kitchen, which has an eating area where utensils       are stored. Enclosed kitchens provide a roof over the cook and keep dogs       and chickens from wandering into the cooking area. The roof is pitched so       that rain will run off. Middle-class houses and commercial buildings have       tiled roofs.\\nFood and Economy\\nFood in Daily Life. Filipinos do not consider it a meal if rice is not served. Plain steamed       rice is the basis of the diet. Three crops a year are harvested to provide       enough rice for the population, and the government keeps surpluses stored       for times of drought. Salt water and freshwater of fish and shellfish are       eaten daily, served either fresh or salted. Fish, chicken and pork are       usually fried, although people are becoming more health-conscious and       often choose alternative methods of cooking. Garlic is added to food       because it is considered healthful. Filipino food is not spicy. All food       is cooked on gas burners or wood or charcoal fires and is allowed to get       cold before it is eaten. Rice is cooked first, since it takes longer. When       it is ready, rice will be placed on the table while the next items of the       meal are prepared and served.\\nTable knives are not used. Forks and spoons are used for dining. The food       is eaten from a spoon. The traditional method of placing food on a banana       leaf and eating with one\\'s hands is also used throughout the       country. It is acceptable to eat food with one\\'s hands at       restaurants as well as in the home.\\nBreakfast is served at 6\\nA.M.\\nand consists of food left over from the night before. It is not reheated.       Eggs and sausage are served on special occasions.         Small buns called pan de sol may be purchased from vendors early in the morning.\\nAt midmorning and in the afternoon, people eat merienda. Since Filipinos are fond of sweet foods, a mixture of instant coffee,       evaporated milk, and sugar may be served. Coca-Cola is very popular. Sweet       rolls, doughnuts, or a noodle dish may be available. Lunch is a light meal       with rice and one other dish, often a fish or meat stew. Fish, pork, or       chicken is served at dinner with a soup made of lentils or vegetables.       Fatty pork is a favorite. Portions of small cubes of browned pork fat are       considered a special dish.\\nFruits are abundant all year. Several kinds of banana are eaten, including       red and green varieties. Mangoes, the national fruit, are sweet and juicy.       A fruit salad with condensed milk and coconut milk is very popular on       special occasions.\\nVegetables are included as part of a soup or stew. Green beans and       potatoes are commonly eaten foods. The leaves of camote, a sweet potato, are used as a salad and soup ingredient. Ube, a bland bright purple potato, is used as a colorful ingredient in cakes       and ice cream. Halo-halo, which means \"mixture,\" is a popular dessert that consists       of layers of corn kernels, ice cream, small gelatin pieces, cornflakes and       shaved ice. Patis, a very salty fish sauce, is placed on the table to be added to any of the       dishes.\\nFast food has become part of the culture, with national and international       chains in many towns. All meals at fast-food restaurant include rice,       although French fries also tend to be on the menu. Banana ketchup is       preferred, although the international chains serve tomato ketchup. A       national chain, Jollibee, has entered the U.S. market with a restaurant in       California, where many Filipino immigrants live. The company plans to       expand to other cities with Filipino populations.\\nFood Customs at Ceremonial Occasions. Léchon, a suckling pig that has been roasted until the skin forms a hard brown       crust, is served at important occasions. The inside is very fatty. Strips       of the skin with attached fat are considered the best pieces. The       importance of the host and the occasion are measured by the amount of léchon. served. Blood drained from the pig is used to make dinuguan\\nSticky rice prepared with coconut milk and sugarcane syrup is wrapped in       banana leaves. Glutinous rice is grown especially for use in this       traditional dessert.\\nGin and beer are available for men and are accompanied by balut, a duck egg with an embryo. Dog meat is a delicacy throughout the country.       It is now illegal to sell dog meat at markets because cases of rabies have       occurred when the brains were eaten.\\nBasic Economy. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing are the occupations of 40 percent of       the thirty million people who are employed. Light manufacturing,       construction, mining and the service industries provide the remainder of       employment opportunities. The unemployment rate is over 9 percent. Fifty       percent of the population lives below the poverty line. The Asian       financial crisis resulted in a lack of jobs, and the drought period of the       El Niño weather cycle has reduced the number of agricultural       positions. It is not uncommon for people to \"volunteer\" as       workers in the health care field in hopes of being chosen to work when a       position becomes available. People work seven days a week and take       additional jobs to maintain or improve their lifestyle or pay for a       child\\'s education. Eight hundred thousand citizens work overseas,       primarily as merchant seamen, health care, household, or factory workers       in Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Over Seas Workers (OSWs) have a       governmental agency that looks after their interests. Laws govern hours of       work, insurance coverage, and vacation time, but workers may be exploited       and mistreated. Recruitment centers are found in all large municipalities.       OSWs send $7 billion home each year, providing 4 percent of the gross       domestic product.\\nLand Tenure and Property. Nineteen percent of the land is arable and 46 percent consists of forests       and woodlands. Deforestation by legal and illegal loggers with no tree       replacement has reduced the number of trees. Large amounts of arable land       remain in the hand of absentee landowners who were given land grants       during the Spanish colonial period. Although land reform legislation has       been passed, loopholes allow owners to retain possession. Those       responsible for enacting and enforcing the legislation often come from the       same families that own the land. Peasant groups such as the HUKs       (People\\'s Liberation Army, or Hukbong Magpapayang Bayan ) in the 1950s and the NPA (New People\\'s Army) at the present time       have resorted to guerrilla tactics to provide land for the poor. There is       an ongoing demand to clear forests to provide farmland. The clearing       technique is slash and burn. Environmentalists are concerned because       timber is destroyed at random, eliminating the homes of endangered species       of plants and animals.\\nCommercial Activities. The local market is a key factor in retail trade. Larger municipalities       have daily markets, while smaller communities have\\nPhilippine children playing on Guimaras Island. Young children             typically live with grandparents or aunts for extended periods.\\nmarkets once or twice a week. Trade at the market is conducted in a       barter system. Suki relationships are established at the marketplace so that the buyer       returns to the same vendor. Markets are divided into \"dry\"       markets where clothing and household items are sold and       \"wet\" markets where food is sold. Sari-sari establishments are small neighborhood stores. They are convenient since       they have packaged products and are in the neighborhood, but no fresh       foods are available there. In larger towns, supermarkets with fixed prices       are adjacent to the market. Electronic equipment, furniture, and clothing       have fixed prices and are sold in stores or at kiosks. Shopping malls are       found in most provincial capitals. Malls with Western shops are found       throughout metropolitan Manila.\\nMajor Industries. Metropolitan Manila is the primary manufacturing area, with 10 percent of       the population living there. Manila and the adjacent ports are the best       equipped to ship manufactured goods. Manufacturing plants produce       electrical and electronic components, chemicals, clothing, and machinery.       The provinces produce processed foods, textiles, tobacco products, and       construction materials. Manufacturing in the home continues to be common       in remote areas.\\nTrade. Rice, bananas, cashews, pineapple, mangoes, and coconut products are the       agricultural products exported to neighboring countries. Exported       manufactured products include electronic equipment, machinery, and       clothing. The United States, members of the European Union, and Japan are       the major trading partners. Imports consists of consumer goods and fuel.       The country has mineral and petroleum reserves that have not been       developed because of the mountainous terrain and a lack of funding.\\nTransportation of products is difficult since the highway system beyond       metropolitan Manila consists of two-lane roads that are under constant       repair and sometimes are washed out by typhoons. Interisland shipping       costs add to the expense of manufacturing. Congress, governmental       agencies, and the financial community are attempting to find solutions to       these problems. The rate of road construction is accelerating and a light       rail system is planned. Filipino membership in the Association of South       East Asian Nations (ASEAN), a regional trade organization, is an important       factor in the development of trade policies.\\nDivision of Labor. In rural areas, lack of mechanization causes the entire family to work in       the rice fields. Planting rice seedlings, separating them, replanting,         and changing water levels in the fields are done by hand and are       labor-intensive. Crops such as tobacco, corn, and sugarcane demand full       family participation for short periods during the planting and harvest       seasons.\\nIn the cities, traditional roles common to industrialized countries are       followed. Men perform heavy physical tasks, while women work as clerks and       teachers and in health care.\\nSocial Stratification\\nClasses and Castes. Filipinos believe in the need for social acceptance and feel that       education can provide upward mobility. Color of skin, beauty, and money       are the criteria that determine a person\\'s social position. Light       coloring is correlated with intelligence and a light-skinned attractive       person will receive advancement before his or her colleagues. Family       position and patron-client associations are useful in achieving success.       Government officials, wealthy friends, and community leaders are sponsors       at hundreds of weddings and baptisms each year. Those connections are of       great importance.\\nThere is a gap between the 2 percent of the population that is wealthy and       the masses who live in poverty. The middle class feels too obligated to       those in power to attempt to make societal changes.\\nThe people of the Philippines enjoy watching professional basketball       played by American professional teams and teams in Filipino professional       leagues. Basketball courts are the only sport-site found in every barangay and school. Cockfights are a popular sport among men. Cocks have metal       spurs attached to the leg just above the foot. The contest continues until       one of the cocks is unable to continue fighting or runs away. Cuneta       Astrodome in metropolitan Manila is used for both professional basketball       and cockfights. Mah-jongg, a Chinese game played with tiles, is very       popular, especially with women.\\nSymbols of Social Stratification. Money to buy consumer goods is an indicator of power. Wealthy people lead       western lifestyles. They travel abroad frequently and pride themselves on       the number of Westerners they have as friends. Since few people outside       Manila have a family car, owning a vehicle is a clear statement of a high       social level. Houses and furnishings show a person\\'s social       position. Upholstered furniture instead of the traditional wooden couches       and beds, rows of electrical appliances that are never used and area rugs       are all important.\\nWomen above the poverty level have extensive wardrobes. Sending       one\\'s children to the best schools is the most important indicator       of social position. The best schools often are private schools and are       quite expensive.\\nPolitical Life\\nGovernment. The country has a republican form of government that was developed during       the commonwealth period. It contains three branches: executive,       legislative, and judicial. The first constitution, based on the United       States Constitution, was written in 1935. When President Marcos declared       martial law in 1972, that constitution was replaced by another one       providing for a head of state, a prime minister, and a unicameral       legislature. The president had the power to dissolve the legislature,       appoint the prime minister, and declare himself prime minister. A new       constitution was approved in a national referendum in 1987. It was similar       to the 1935 constitution but included term limitations. The 221 members of       the House may serve three consecutive three-year terms, which is also the       case for provincial governors. The twenty-four senators, who are elected       at large, may serve two consecutive six-year terms. The president serves       one six-year term, but the vice president may serve two consecutive       six-year terms. The president and vice president do not run on the same       ticket and may be political opponents.\\nThe seventy provinces have governors but no legislative bodies. Over sixty       cities have been created by legislation. Cityhood is desirable since       cities are funded separately from the provinces so that additional federal       money comes into the area. Each province is divided into municipalities.       The smallest unit of government is the barangay, which contains up to two       hundred dwellings and an elementary school. The barangay captain       distributes funds at the local level.\\nLeadership and Political Officials. Charges of corruption, graft, and cronyism are common among government       officials at all levels. People accept cronyism and the diversion of a       small percentage of funds as natural. Rewriting the constitution to       eliminate term limits and establishing a strong two-party system are the       reforms that are discussed most often. Politicians move from party to       party as the needs of their constituencies dictate because the political       parties have no ideologies.\\nMany of the people who are currently active in politics were politically       active in the commonwealth era. Men of rank in the military also move into       the\\nA house belonging to a family of the Igorot tribe in Bontoc. The             Philippines are home to approximately sixty ethnic groups in seventy             to eighty language groups.\\npolitical arena. Joseph Estrada, whose term as president is       1998–2004, entered the public eye as a popular film star. He then       became the mayor of a large city and went on to become vice president in       the Ramos administration. Previous presidents have had political or       military backgrounds, with the exception of Corazon Aquino, the president       from 1986 to 1992, who became politically active after her husband was       assassinated.\\nSocial Problems and Control. The formal system of law mirrors that of the United States. A police       force, which has been part of the army since 1991, and a system of trials,       appeals, and prisons are the components of the apparatus for dealing with       crime. Theft is the most common crime. Because the Philippines has a cash       economy, thieves and pick-pockets can easily gain access to thousands of       pesos. Petty thieves are unlikely to be apprehended unless a theft is       discovered immediately. Another common crime is murder, which often is       committed under the influence of alcohol. Guns are readily available.       Incest is punished severely if the victim is younger than fifteen years       old. Capital punishment by lethal injection was restored during the Ramos       administration. Six executions of men convicted of incest have taken place       since 1998. Illicit drugs are found throughout the archipelago but are       more common in the capital area and the tourist centers. Marijuana and       hashish are exported.\\nAn ongoing concern is the desire for autonomy among tribal groups.       Mindanoao and the Cordilleras Autonomous Region, where indigenous groups       are located, are allowed a greater degree of local control and receive       additional funds from the government. Muslim Mindanao has a strong       separatist movement. Terrorist groups have developed in support of the       movement. In the year 2000, terrorists engaged in acts of kidnaping for       ransom, a crime that is common in the country. The government deployed       additional military forces to attack terrorist strongholds.\\nMilitary Activity. The armed forces consist of an army, a navy, a coast guard, and an air       force. The army includes the Philippines National Police; the navy       includes the marines. Military service is voluntary. Public respect for       the military is high. Military expenditures account for 1.5 percent of the       gross domestic product. Current military activity is focused on terrorist       activity in Mindanao. The oil-rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea       are an area of concern that is monitored by the navy. The Spratlys belong       to the Philippines but are claimed by several other countries, and the       Chinese have unsuccessfully         attempted to establish a base there. In 1998, the Philippines signed a       visiting forces agreement that allows United States forces to enter the       country to participate in joint training maneuvers.\\nSocial Welfare and Change Programs\\nLand reform has been a concern since independence. Spanish and American       rule left arable land concentrated in the hands of 2 percent of the       population and those owners will not give up their land without       compensation. Attempts made to provide land, such as the resettlement of       Christian farmers in Mindanao in the 1950s, have not provided enough land       to resolve the problem. Until land reform takes place, poverty will be the       nation\\'s primary social problem. Eighty percent of the rural       population and half the urban population live in poverty. Governmental       organizations provide health clinics and medical services, aid in       establishing micro businesses such as craft shops and small factories, and       offer basic services for the disabled. The number of beggars increases in       times of high unemployment. People consider it good luck to give money to       a poor person, and so beggars manage to survive.\\nNongovernmental Organizations and Other Associations\\nWhile nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) work throughout the country to       solve social problems, they are most visible in metropolitan Manila, where       they work with squatters. The rural poor gravitate to urban areas, cannot       find a place to live, and settle in public areas, riverbanks and garbage       dumps. It is estimated that one of every four residents of metropolitan       Manila is a squatter. Shanty towns are so large that in 2000, when rains       from two successive typhoons made garbage dumps collapse, over two hundred       people were buried alive as their homes were swept away. Nongovernmental       organizations exert pressure on the government for land on which squatters       can build permanent housing. Forced evictions are another target of NGOs,       since an alternative place to live is not provided.\\nVolunteer agencies from the United States, the United Kingdom, the       Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Japan work with NGOs and governmental       agencies. Projects to help children and meet environmental needs are the       focus of volunteer efforts. Volunteer agencies are supervised by the       Philippine National Volunteer Service Coordinating Agency.\\nA farmhouse overlooks vegetables growing on a terraced field. In             these volcanic islands, mountains are common.\\nGender Roles and Statuses\\nDivision of Labor by Gender. Traditional roles prevail in rural areas, where men cultivate the land       but the entire family is involved in planting and harvesting the crops.       Women work in gardens and care for the house and children as well as       barnyard animals. In urban areas, men work in construction and machine       upkeep and as drivers of passenger vehicles. Women work as teachers,       clerks, owners of sari-sari stores, marketers of produce and health care providers. Occupational       gender lines are blurred since men also work as nurses and teachers. In       the professions, gender lines are less important. Women attorneys, doctors       and lawyers are found in the provinces as well as in urban areas.\\nThe Relative Status of Women and Men. While families desire male children, females are welcomed to supply help       in the house and provide a home in the parents\\' old age.       Women\\'s rights to equality and to share the family inheritance with       male siblings are firmly established and are not questioned. The oldest       daughter is expected to become an OSW to provide money for the education       of younger siblings and for the needs of aging family members. Women are       the familial money managers. The wedding         ceremony can include the gift of a coin from the groom to the bride to       acknowledge this role.\\nSince personal relationships and wealth are considered the road to       success, women have an equal opportunity to achieve. Winners of beauty       pageants are likely to succeed in the business and professional world,       especially if the pageant was at an international level.\\nMarriage, Family and Kinship\\nMarriage. Marriage is a civil ceremony that is conducted city offices. A religious       ceremony also is performed. The ceremony is similar to those in the United       States with the addition of sponsors. Principal sponsors are friends and       relatives who have positions of influence in the community. The number of       principal sponsors attests to the popularity and potential success of a       couple. It also reduces a couple\\'s expenses, since each principal       sponsor is expected to contribute a substantial amount of cash. Members of       the wedding party are secondary sponsors who do not have to provide funds.\\nArranged marriages have not been part of Filipino life. However, men are       expected to marry and if a man has not married by his late twenties,       female relatives begin introducing him to potential brides. The median age       for marriage is twenty-two. Young professionals wait until their late       twenties to marry, and engagements of five to seven years are not       uncommon. During this period, the couple becomes established in jobs, pays       for the education of younger siblings, and acquires household items. A       woman who reaches the age of thirty-two without marrying is considered       past the age for marriage. Women believe that marriage to a wealthy man or       a foreigner will guarantee happiness. Divorce is illegal, but annulment is       available for the dissolution of a marriage. Reasons for annulment include       physical incapacity, physical violence, or pressure to change one\\'s       religious or political beliefs. Interfaith marriages are rare.\\nDomestic Unit. The extended family is the most important societal unit, especially for       women. Women\\'s closest friendships come from within the family.       Mothers and daughters who share a home make decisions concerning the home       without conferring with male family members. One child remains in the       family home to care for the parents and grandparents. This child, usually       a daughter, is not necessarily unmarried. The home may include assorted       children from the extended family, and single aunts and uncles. Several       houses may be erected on the same lot to keep the family together.       Childcare is shared. Fathers carry and play with children but are unlikely       to change diapers. Grandparents who live in the home are the primary care       givers for the children since both parents generally work. Preschool       grandchildren who live in other communities may be brought home for their       grandparents to raise. Indigent relatives live in the family circle and       provide as household and childcare help. Young people may work their way       through college by exchanging work for room and board. Family bonds are so       close that nieces and nephews are referred to as one\\'s own children       and cousins are referred to as sisters and brothers. Unmarried adult women       may legally adopt one of a sibling\\'s children.\\nInheritance. Inheritance laws are based on those in the United States. These laws       provide that all children acknowledged by a father, whether born in or out       of wedlock, share equally in the estate. Females share equally with males.\\nKin Groups. Because of the closeness of the immediate family, all familial ties are       recognized. Anyone who is remotely related is known as a cousin.       Indigenous tribes live in clan groups. Marriage into another clan may mean       that the individual is considered dead to his or her clan.\\nPeople have a strong sense of belonging to a place. A family that has       lived in metropolitan Manila for two generations still regards a       municipality or province as its home. New Year\\'s Day, Easter, and       All Saint\\'s Day are the most important family holidays. Bus traffic       from Manila to the provinces increases dramatically at these times, with       hundreds of extra buses taking people home to their families.\\nSocialization\\nInfant Care. Infants are raised by family members. Young children are sent to live       with their grandparents or aunts for extended periods. People who live       outside the country leave their children with the family for the preschool       years.\\nInfants spend their waking time in someone\\'s arms until they can       walk. They are part of every activity and learn by observation. Someone       will remain in the room with them when they sleep. Infant mortality is       high, and so great care is taken of babies. Helpers and older sisters       assist with the dayto-day care of babies.\\nChild Rearing and Education. Children are seldom alone in a system in which adults desire company\\nWorkers spread rice on palm mats to dry in the midday sun. Filipinos             do not consider a meal complete without rice.\\nand do not understand the need for privacy. Children have no pressure to       become toilet trained or to learn to eat at the table. They are spoon fed       or eat from a parent\\'s plate until the age of six. They must learn       respect for authority, obedience, and religious faith. Self-esteem is       fostered. A child\\'s first birthday is celebrated with a party.\\nFilipinos regard education as the path to upward mobility. Ninety percent       of the population over ten years of age is literate. The Department of       Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) is the largest governmental       department. Approximately twelve million elementary school pupils and five       million secondary students attended school in 1999 and 2000. Education is       compulsory until age twelve. Statistics indicate that children from the       poorest 40 percent of the population do not attend school. Elementary       education is a six-year program; secondary education is a four-year       program. Pre-schools and kindergartens are seldom available in public       schools but are in private schools. Children are grouped homogeneously by       ability. First grade students begin being taught in Filipino; English is       added after two months. In elementary and secondary schools, reading,       science, and mathematics are taught in English while values, social       studies, and health are taught in Filipino. Children learn some Filipino       and English words from the media. \"Linga franca\" is an       experimental approach in which students are taught in the native dialect       and Filipino for the first two years and English in the third grade. This       program came about as a response to concerns that English was being used       more than were the native languages.\\nElementary school, secondary school, and college students are required to       wear uniforms. Girls wear pleated skirts and white blouses. Public school       pupils wear dark blue skirts. Each private school has its own color. Boys       wear white shirts and dark pants. Women teachers are given a government       allowance to purchase four uniforms to wear Monday through Thursday. Men       wear dark pants and a barong, a lightweight cotton shirt, or a polo shirt. Female teachers are       addressed as ma\\'am (pronounced \"mum\"). Male teachers       are addressed as sir. These titles are highly prized and are used by       teachers in addressing one another.\\nClass sizes range from twenty to more than fifty in public schools. The       goal is to keep class size below fifty. Pupils may have to share books and       desks. Schools may lack electricity and have dirt floors or be flooded in       the rainy season. The walls may not be painted. The Japanese, Chinese, and       Australians have provided new classrooms, scientific supplies, and teacher       training for the public schools. Private schools charge fees but have       smaller         class sizes. They have a reputation of providing a better education than       do the public schools.\\nComputers are not readily available in elementary or secondary schools       although DECS is stressing technology. President Estrada met with Bill       Gates of Microsoft to procure computers and software for use in the       schools.\\nClassrooms in both public and private schools have a picture of the Virgin       Mary and the president at the front of the room. Grottoes to the Virgin       Mary or a patron saint are found on school campuses. School days begin and       end with prayer.\\nThe school year runs from June to March to avoid the hot months of April       and May. School starts at seven-thirty and ends at four-thirty with a       break of one and a half hours for lunch. No meals are served at the       school, although the parent-teacher association may run a stand that sells       snacks for break time.\\nDropping out is a serious concern. In 1999 and 2000, the high school       dropout rate increased from 9 percent to 13 percent. The increase is       attributed to the need to provide care for younger siblings or to get a       job to enable the family to survive the high inflation and the currency       devaluation that followed the Asian financial crisis. The DECS has a       Non-Formal Education Division to meet the needs of out-of-school youth as       well as the needs of uneducated adults. Programs include adult literacy,       agriculture and farm training, occupational skills, and training in health       and nutrition. Programs for at-risk youth are being added at the high       school level. The Open High School System Act of 2000 is designed to       provide distance learning via television for youths and uneducated adults.\\nHigher Education. A college degree is necessary to obtain positions that promise security       and advancement. Approximately two million students attend colleges and       universities. Each province has a state college system with several       locations. The University of the Philippines, located in Manila, is a       public university that is regarded as the best in the country. Private       colleges are found in the major municipalities. The University of Santo       Tomas in Manila is a private school that was established in 1611; it is       the oldest site of higher education in the country. English is the primary       language of instruction at the college level. Colleges and universities       have large enrollments for advanced degrees since a four year degree may       not be sufficient to work in the higher levels of government service.\\nEtiquette\\nPeople believe that it is one\\'s duty to keep things operating       smoothly. It is very important not to lose face. Being corrected or       correcting another person in public is not considered acceptable behavior.       People want to grant all requests, and so they often say yes when they       mean no or maybe. Others understand when the request is not fulfilled       because saying no might have caused the individual to lose face. When one       is asked to join a family for a meal, the offer must be refused. If the       invitation is extended a second time, it is permissible to accept. Time       consciousness and time management are not important considerations. A       planned meeting may take place later, much later, or never.\\nFilipinos walk hand in hand or arm in arm with relatives and friends of       either sex as a sign of affection or friendship. Women are expected not to       cross their legs or drink alcohol in public. Shorts are not common wear       for women.\\nPeople pride themselves on hospitality. They readily go out of their way       to help visitors or take them to their destination. It is of the highest       importance to recognize the positions of others and use full titles and       full names when introducing or referring to people. Non-verbal language,       such as pointing to an object with one\\'s lips, is a key element in       communication. One greets friends by lifting the eyebrows. A longer lift       can be used to ask a question.\\nReligion\\nReligious Beliefs. The Philippines is the only Christian nation in Asia. More than 85 percent of the people are Roman Catholic. The rosary is said in the home       at 9\\nP.M.\\n, just before the family retires for the night. Children are introduced to       the statue of \"Mama Mary\" at a very early age.\\nProtestant missionaries arrived in 1901 and followed the Catholic example       of establishing hospitals, clinics, and private schools. The Church of the       Latter Day Saints (Mormons) is currently the most active missionary group.\\nSunni Muslims constitute the largest non-Christian group. They live in       Mindanao and the Sulu Islands but have migrated to other provinces. Muslim       provinces celebrate Islamic religious holidays as legal holidays. Mosques       are located in large cities throughout the country. In smaller       communities, Muslims gather in small buildings for services. Animism, a       belief that natural objects have souls, is the oldest religion in the       country, practiced by indigenous peoples in the mountains of Luzon.\\nA roundabout with a fountain sits between old buildings in Manila.             Some areas of the city were destroyed during World War II, when the             country was invaded by Japan and then liberated by the United             States.\\nFreedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution. The disagreement       between the Muslim population of the southern provinces and the federal       government is not so much about religion as it is about political goals.       Non-Catholics do not object to Catholic symbols or prayer in public       venues.\\nEach barangay has a patron saint. The saint\\'s day is celebrated by       a fiesta that includes a religious ceremony. Large amounts of food are       served at each house. Friends and relatives from other barangays are       invited and go from house to house to enjoy the food. A talent show,       beauty contest, and dance are part of the fun. Carnival rides and bingo       games add to the festivities.\\nReligious Practitioners. Religious leaders are powerful figures. Business and political leaders       court Cardinal Jaime Sin because of his influence with much of the       population. Local priest and ministers are so highly respected that       requests from them take on the power of mandates. A family considers       having a son or daughter with a religious career as a         high honor. Personal friendships with priests, ministers, and nuns are       prized. Clerics take an active role in the secular world. An example is       Brother Andrew Gonzales, the current secretary of DECS.\\nFaith healers cure illness by prayer or touch. \"Psychic\"       healers operate without using scalpels or drawing blood. The several       thousand healers are Christians. They believe that if they ask for a fee,       their power will disappear. Patients are generous with gifts because       healers are greatly respected.\\nRituals and Holy Places. The major rituals are customary Christian or Muslim practices. Sites       where miracles have taken place draw large crowds on Sundays and feast       days. Easter is the most important Christian observance. On Easter       weekend, the entire Christian area of the country is shut down from noon       on Maundy Thursday until the morning of Black Saturday. International       flights continue and hospitals are open, but national television       broadcasts, church services, and shops and restaurants are closed and       public transportation is sparse. People stay at home or go to church.       Special events take place on Good Friday. There are religious processions       such as a parade of the statues of saints throughout the community.\\nDeath and the Afterlife. A twenty-four-hour vigil is held at the deceased person\\'s home,       and the body is escorted to the cemetery after the religious ceremony. The       tradition is for mourners to walk behind the coffin. A mausoleum is built       during the lifetime of the user. The size of the edifice indicates the       position of the builder.\\nMourning is worn for six weeks after the death of a family member. It may       consists of a black pin worn on the blouse or shirt of the mourner or       black clothing. Mourning is put aside after one year. A meal or party is       provided for family members and close friends one year after the burial to       commemorate recognize the memory of the deceased.\\nAll Saint\\'s Day (1 November) is a national holiday to honor the       dead. Grave sites are cleared of debris and repaired. Families meet at the       cemetery and stay throughout the twenty-four hours. Candles and flowers       are placed on the graves. Food and memories are shared, and prayers are       offered for the souls of the dead. When a family member visits a grave       during the year, pebbles are placed on the grave to indicate that the       deceased has been remembered.\\nMedicine and Health Care\\nLife expectancy is seventy years for females and sixty-four years for       males. The Health Care Law of\\nPainted Jeepneys on a city street.\\n1995 provides citizens with basic health care at no cost through       subsidies. The working poor are given financial assistance when necessary.       Children receive inoculations at no cost. The World Health Organization       (WHO) declared the Philippines to be polio-free in 2000. It is the first       nation in the world to be recognized for the elimination of polio.\\nRegional public hospitals provide service to everyone. People who live far       away ride a bus for hours to reach the hospital. Funds for ambulances are       raised by lotteries within each barangay or are provided by congressmen       and are used only for the people who live in that area. Private hospitals       are considered superior to public hospitals. Paying patients are not       discharged from hospitals until the bill is paid in full. Patients have kasamas (companions) who remain with them during the hospital stay. Kasamas       assist with nursing chores by giving baths, getting food trays, taking       samples to the nurses\\' station and questioning the doctor. A bed       but no food is provided for the kasama in the hospital room.\\nThe infant mortality rate is 48.9 percent, and one-third of the children       are malnourished. Over 13 percent of preschool and elementary school       children are underweight. A government program provides nutritious food       for impoverished pupils at the midmorning break. This is only offered to       schools in the         poorest areas. National test scores are examined to see if improvement       has occurred. If the scores are better, the program is expanded.\\nThe most prevalent health problem is \"high blood\"       (hypertension). One in ten persons over the age of fifteen has high blood       pressure. Tuberculosis is another health concern; The country has the       fourth highest mortality rate in the world from that disease. Malaria and       dengue fever are prevalent because there is no effective program for       mosquito control. The number of deaths attributed to dengue increased in       the late 1990s.\\nHerbal remedies are used alone or in conjunction with prescribed       medications. A dog bite treated with antibiotics and rabies shots also may       be treated with garlic applied to the puncture. The study of herbal       remedies is part of the school health curriculum. Many elementary schools       have herb gardens that are planted and cared for by the students.\\nSecular Celebrations\\nNew Year\\'s Day is more of a family holiday than Christmas. It is       combined with Rizal Day on 30 December to provide time for people to go       home to their province. Midnight on New Year\\'s Eve brings an       outburst of firecrackers and gunfire from randomly aimed firearms.\\nOther national secular holidays are Fall of Bataan Day, an observation of       the Bataan Death March in 1942 on 9 April. Labor Day is celebrated on 1       May. Independence Day on 12 June celebrates freedom from Spanish rule. It       is celebrated with fiestas, parades, and fireworks. Sino-Filipinos       celebrate the Chinese New Year, which is not a national holiday, in       January or February. In Manila, fireworks and parades take place       throughout Chinatown. Muslims celebrate Islamic festivals.\\nArts and Humanities\\nSupport for the Arts. The government provides support for institutions such as the National       Museum in Manila. Libraries exists in colleges and universities. The best       collections are in Manila. Museums are located in provincial capitals and       in Manila. The Cultural Center of the Philippines in Manila is a center       for the performing arts that opened in 1970. It is a multibuilding complex       created under the direction of former first lady Imelda Marcos, who       encouraged musicians to enter the international community and receive       additional training. Nongovernmental organizations preserve the folk       heritage of the indigenous groups.\\nLiterature. Literature is based on the oral traditions of folklore, the influence of       the church and Spanish and American literature. Filipino written       literature became popular in the mid-nineteenth century as the middle       class became educated. The greatest historical literature evolved from the       independence movement. José Rizal electrified the country with his       novels. During the early years of American control, literature was written       in English. The English and American literature that was taught in the       schools was a factor in the kind of writing that was produced. Writing in       Filipino languages became more common in the late 1930s and during the       Japanese occupation. Literature is now written in both Filipino and       English. Textbooks contain national and world literature.\\nGraphic Arts. The Filipino Academy of Art, established in 1821, shows early art       reflecting Spanish and religious themes. Juan Luna and Felix Hidalgo were       the first Filipino artists to win recognition in Europe at the end of the       nineteenth century. Contemporary artists use a variety of techniques and       mediums to reflect social and political life. Crafts reflect the national       culture. Each area of the country has specialties that range from the       batik cotton prints of the Muslim areas to the wood carvings of the       mountain provinces of Luzon. Baskets and mats are created from rattan.       Textiles are woven by hand in cooperatives, storefronts, and homes. Banana       and pineapple fiber cloth, cotton, and wool are woven into textiles.       Furniture and decorative items are carved. Silver and shell crafts also       are created\\nSex and violence are major themes in films, which are often adaptations of       American screen productions. American films are popular and readily       available, and so high-quality Filipino films have been slow to develop.\\nPerformance Arts. Drama before Spanish colonization was of a religious nature and was       intended to persuade the deities to provide the necessities of life. The       Spanish used drama to introduce the Catholic religion. Filipino themes in       drama developed in the late nineteenth century as the independence       movement evolved. Current themes are nationalistic and reflect daily life.\\nDance is a mixture of Filipino and Spanish cultures. Professional dance       troupes perform ballet, modern dance, and folk dance. Folk dances are       performed at meetings and conferences and reflect a strong Spanish       influence. Indigenous dances are used in historical pageants. An example       is a bamboo dance relating a story about a bird moving among the reeds.       People enjoy ballroom dancing for recreation.         Dance instructors are available at parties to teach the waltz and the       cha-cha.\\nMusic performance begins in the home and at school. Amateur performances       featuring song and dance occur at fiestas. Popular music tends to be       American. Guitars are manufactured for export; folk instruments such as       the nose flute also are constructed.\\nThe State of the Physical and Social Sciences\\nThe physical sciences focus on the needs of the country. Aquaculture, the       development of fish and shellfish farms in coastal areas, is a rapidly       growing field. Centuries of fishing and dynamiting fish have changed the       balance of nature. Hormonal research to stimulate the growth of fish and       shellfish is a priority. Control of red tide, an infestation that makes       shellfish unsafe to eat, is another area of concentration. Agricultural       research and research into volcano and earthquake control are other areas       of study. The development of geothermal and other energy sources is       ongoing. Other environmental research areas of importance are waste       resource management, water resource management, and forest management. The       social sciences are focused on the needs of the country with the primary       emphasis on resolving the problems of poverty and land reform.\\nBibliography\\nDepartment of Education, Culture and Sports.

Nowadays, Filipinos\\' widespread use of \"Taglish\"                                often perplexes their international business                                partners, including Norwegian shipping company                                managers, who say that they often cross linguistic                                wires when speaking with their Filipino ship                                crews.

In 2000, there were only four                                call centers in the country, employing 2,400                                call-center agents. At the end of 2005, there were at                                least 105 call centers with over 112,000 workers,                                representing a 60% per annum growth surge.\\nAccording to Dan Sebastian                                Reyes, chief executive officer of Clientlogic, a                                call-center firm, that\\'s a growth record that not even                                India, which currently employs 350,000 call-center agents                                but is now facing similar human resource                                restraints, has been able to replicate.\\nSignificantly, the frenetic growth of the                                Philippines\\' outsourcing industry coincided with                                an unfortunate concomitant trend: the brain-drain                                of skilled professionals to higher paying                                countries. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the bulk                                of Filipino labor exports were composed of                                low-skilled workers, mostly construction workers,                                domestic helpers, and entertainers.\\nBy                                2000, however, officials from the Philippine                                Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), a                                government agency managing the placement of                                overseas Filipino workers, recorded a rising tide                                of fleeing skilled workers and professionals,                                including doctors, nurses, engineers, information                                technology professionals and banking                                professionals, among others. In other words,                                precisely the types of workers outsourcing                                companies would most like to hire.\\nThe                                growing scarcity of English speakers has alarmed                                the Philippines-based outsourcing community, which                                executives say they began to notice shortages as                                early as 2003. Many of these companies have since                                established training programs at private                                universities and human resource consulting companies that train potential recruits.\\nFor instance, outsourcer FuturePerfect is                                helping Mapua Institute of Technology, one of the                                leading engineering and technology schools in                                Manila, to develop their English language                                curriculum and retrain their English instructors.                                IBM-Daksh, a business process outsourcing services                                provider, is providing voice and accent training                                for students at the Asia-Pacific College, a                                business college based in Makati.\\nJohn                                Clements Consulting, meanwhile, has tied up with                                the state-owned Technical Education and Skills                                Development Authority (Tesda) to train so-called                                \"near-hires\" in several remote regions of the                                Philippines. According to Dominguez, John                                Clements\\' CEO, this has led to a 60% absorption                                rate of students trained in the program.\\nSensing the potential loss in one of                                the few bright spots in the Philippines\\' economy,                                the national government has also started to                                throw money at the problem. President                                Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo recently earmarked P500                                million ($9.8 million) for outsourcing industry                                training. As a part of that scheme, students                                interested in outsourcing jobs are given vouchers                                that may be used for tuition at                                government-accredited human resources                                institutions.\\nLocsin, head of the BPA/P                                outsourcing trade group, claimed that government                                and private efforts had already started to address                                the problem. Perhaps predictably, he played down                                the labor shortage, chalking it up to media hype.                                \"I\\'ve met with several call centers lately, and                                they told me their hiring rate of fresh graduates                                who walk in to apply is now significantly higher                                at 8-10%,\" said Locsin. \"Last year, it was 2-4%.

      "[0.00017028711603273632, '5. Interpersonal Heterosexual Behaviors\\nA. Children\\nIn Filipino society today, it is not unusual for preteenage boys to engage in exploratory \\x93sex\\x94 games with other boys and girls. Such exploratory play allows the child to reassure him/herself of the normality of his or her body. This kind of childhood sexual rehearsal games was more common in the past and in rural areas, when violence and drugs were not as devastating as they are now in the urban areas. In some cases, boys would observe couples kissing and hugging in the park. Occasionally, they sit in the balconies of movie theaters where couples are engaging in heavy petting. In the rural areas and barrios, boys commonly compare their bodies with a friend, relative, or schoolmates. Generally speaking, parents and other adults have a mildly negative response when they discover child sexual play, ranging from warnings to spankings.\\nB. Adolescents\\nOur knowledge of the sexual attitudes and behaviors of the Filipino youth is limited to a very few anecdotal reports, most of which deal with middleand upper-class urban teenagers rather than the rural poor and urban street children. In this very limited context, my personal experience was the basis of my premedical school thesis on \\x93First Night Sexual Experience of Young Boys - 1968.\\x94 This study consisted of personal interviews with 80 adolescents in the rural areas of Cebu during social dances and summer festivals. The majority of these teenagers were interested in obtaining information regarding nocturnal emissions, love, sexual intercourse, and, for women, contraception and pregnancy. Most of the males\\x92 ideas on sexuality were derived from older boys, brothers, and their uncles. On the other hand, the girls were too timid or shy to answer the sexuality questions.\\nDuring the author\\x92s return visit to the Philippines in July 1995 as an invited speaker at a college sociocultural conference, he arranged an impromptu meeting with middle and high school students, grades seven through ten. They informed me that most of their teachers believed that they were too young to hear about sex education. The teachers did not allow questions from their students during the lecture on \\x93family education.\\x94 Most instructors were too insecure and embarrassed, and so were unable to facilitate any in-depth dialogue. In Catholic Filipino society, the Christian dogma still has a strong influence on the teachers\\x92 moral and religious values, so that, despite the presence of a government-mandated educational climate, sexuality remains taboo in public discussion. Unfortunately, these teenagers were afraid to elaborate further, confessing only that it is attitudes like this, repeated in their conservative homes, that make them view society and family cynically.\\nIn Christian colleges and universities, being pregnant out of wedlock can result in expulsion. In most public non-sectarian universities, sex education is still mostly non-existent except for those basic biological courses and family planning programs mandated by the government in 1972. However, in the largest government-run university, the University of the Philippines, sex education courses are more in-depth and liberal, because of the sophistication of the instructors and department heads who are Westernized and comfortable with controversial and sensitive ideas.\\nAlthough still limited, some might say elementary, sexuality courses in most urban medical schools are generally open to updating because of the infusion of new ideas from visiting professors and experts in periodic international forums and conferences. The best medical school students can graduate as doctors at the young age of 23, a factor that makes their communications with patients about sexual issues difficult at best.\\nPubertal Rites for Boys\\nThe anatomical and physiological changes that herald puberty are universal to the human race. However, in Filipino society, the sociocultural pubertal rites are expressed in a variety of customs and traditions depending on the particular subculture and its religious orientation. In the Christian tradition, the custom is to circumcise all males. Male circumcision is performed either by a medical doctor trained in this surgery or by a traditional medicine man. Filipino boys may be circumcised as newborn infants or somewhere around age 8 to 10 years, when they are in the third or fourth grade. City dwellers and the sophisticated elite have their newborn males circumcised before they are discharged from the hospital. Working class and poor families seldom have their newborns circumcised, but usually wait until the boys are 9 or 10 years of age. The medicine man is not a medical doctor, but a man of ordinary skills who has learned the art of circumcision handed down from his father or grandfather.\\nCircumcision is done in two ways. In superincision, a dorsal-mesal cut is made along the length of the upper surface of the penis, from the base to the foreskin, or only on the top of the foreskin. In the coronal technique, the excess foreskin is removed with a circular incision, as is the practice in Europe and North America. When a medical doctor performs either of these types of circumcision, the incision is closed by sutures and oral antibiotics are prescribed to avoid post-operative infection. The medicine man, on the other hand, only performs the dorsal slit circumcision, using a specially \\x93cleaned\\x94 (not sterilized) sharp knife or a modified slender \\x93machete\\x94 as scalpel. The medicine man uses neither antibiotics nor anesthesia.\\nThis pubertal initiation traditionally occurs in the spring or when the schools begin summer recess, somewhere in May or June. The ceremony commences when boys, aged 8 to 12 years old, march in procession, usually in groups of ten to twelve, to the medicine man\\x92s house. The medicine man, with the parents\\x92 knowledge and consent, will then lead the boys to a secluded place, a clearing in a thicket or on a farm to insure privacy. The boy with pants removed, is seated on the edge of a rock or stump of a tree, while the medicine man sharpens and cleans the knife. Despite this tension-producing build-up, the boy must remain calm and composed to show that he is brave and ready to enter the new realm of adulthood and can handle the rigors of manhood. The medicine man places the knife\\x92s sharpest side underneath the tip of the excess prepuce (avoiding the glans penis). He instructs the boy to look up, saying \\x93look for a bird or a plane,\\x94 diverting his attention. In a split second, a piece of wood or a branch is struck down against the knife, resulting in a midline cut or dorsal slit of the prepuce. Bleeding may be profuse or minimal. The juice of a certain tropical palm plant (nipa palm) is squeezed over the wound as a post-surgical anesthetic and caustic agent to stop the bleeding. No wound dressing is applied to cover the fresh and rugged incision. A clamp of cobwebs or a mesh scraped from the underside of a coconut palm branch over the incision serves as a bandage and additional clotting agent (to stop further bleeding). In some parts of the Philippines, the medicine man spits on the wound pre-chewed tobacco or a concoction of guava (a tropical peach-like fruit) leaves to act as a clotting agent. Both the cobwebs and coconut palm scrapings act as mechanical meshes to trap blood platelets in order to stop bleeding. The guava leaves mixed with saliva has papase, a chemical agent that medically can minimize post-operation swelling and sometimes arrest bleeding.\\nAfter circumcision, the boys walk home without a sound of complaint or grimace of pain. It is interesting to note that a particular gait can be discerned before and after the circumcision. The boys naturally walk normally on their way to the medicine man\\x92s house. When they walk back to their homes, their gait is characterized by a \\x93frog-like\\x94 walk, in which the knees are spread away from each other in order to avoid the thighs touching the newly circumcised genitalia. For three to five days, the circumcised boys stay home. Some wear skirts borrowed from their sisters or mothers, not pants, so that clothes do not touch or accidentally hit the sensitive, partially exposed glans (head) penis. Despite daily wound washing in the ocean, a river, or stream, about 90 to 95 percent of these cases of non-sterile circumcision become infected. It takes about six to eight weeks for the wound to heal, usually without ugly scars or deforming penile skin adhesions.\\nIn the 1970s, Muslim boys were not usually circumcised unless their parents were well-educated and health-aware of Westernized attitudes of that time. In the early 1950s, boys of minority families in the north were not circumcised. However, with the arrival of foreign Christian missionaries and their conversion to Christianity, most of the boys are now circumcised either by a medicine man or a physician.\\nPuberty Rites for Young Females\\nChristian girls undergo two phases of social transition to womanhood: ritual ear piercing and a cotillion or debutantes\\x92 ball. Ear piercing is neither a religious nor a pubertal rite. It is just a custom, a traditional \\x93tribal\\x94 rite of socially announcing that the person is a girl. The piercing of the ear is usually done between one month after birth and 2 or 3 years of age. In some parts of the country, the girl is much older. Ear piercing is usually done by a hair stylist, a \\x93medicine woman,\\x94 or medical person. Outpatient procedures by medical personnel use properly sterilized needles. Oftentimes, however, no anesthesia or antibiotic is given when the piercing is done by a hair stylist or a medicine woman. In general, however, infections from ear piercing are not as common as in male circumcisions done by a medicine man with an unsterilized knife. Phase two, the debutante\\x92s ball or cotillion, is a social introduction of young females ages 16 to 18 years in the form of an elaborate party or dinner dance. The hostess of this social event is an 18-year-old female usually from the rich families. Cotillion is an old Spanish tradition, dating back to colonial days, when the daughters of foreign dignitaries or tenured Spanish government officials were introduced to the eligible bachelors of the equally rich in order to secure the daughter\\x92s future financial and sociopolitical status as eligible and eminently suitable future wives.\\nIn the Muslim or Moros community, about 10 percent of the Filipino population, the ear-piercing ritual is the same as among Christians. In the early 1950s, the older girls would wear a veil. At present, young females seldom use veils or cover their faces. Some Muslims include the cotillion in their rite of passage, but for others, dancing or any form of partying is absolutely prohibited and considered sacrilegious.\\nThe minorities, Ifugaos, Kalingas, Igorots, and others, account for 3 to 5 percent of the population. These females, like most Filipinas, have their ears pierced at any early age. However, in some tribes, family wealth and status are demonstrated by the number of earrings or the layers of necklaces worn. No form of female circumcision or genital mutilation has been recorded. Anecdotal reports suggest that during the pre-Hispanic colonial days, some tribal females wore multi-appendage rings, nose, and lip rings. These tribal cultures do not observe the cotillion.\\nPremarital Sexual Activities\\nSexual attitudes and behavior differ from one group of Filipino youth to another, depending on their social class, educational level, and place of residence. In metropolitan and large cities, Manila, Quezon, Cebu, Iloilo, Davao, Dumaquete, and Zamboanga, adolescents and young adults are exposed to the cosmopolitan life and consequently receive more information on sex and sexuality. They are also freer to experience numerous options than are less educated youths. Youth in small towns have narrower and more restricted ideas on sexuality, because of the family\\x92s and Church\\x92s strong control and influence. Furthermore, youngsters in big cities have easy access to adult magazines and entertainment, in which sexuality is openly discussed or shown, even though their parents and the Church try to hide such information from them. The majority of urban youth knows about contraceptives and can acquire these from pharmacies or from friends without problems. Despite the guilt and shame associated with sex, middle- and upper-class urban youth often engage in sexual contacts with girlfriends, household maids, and even prostitutes. For the youths of the poverty belts around the big cities, the situation is compounded by the lack of money and self-control. Even if they would prefer to use a contraceptive, they cannot afford them and there are no places where they can get them free. Oral contraceptives are only given free to married women for family planning purposes by government-run city and municipal health clinics. Although condoms were distributed freely in public high schools in the early 1990s on a mandate from the Secretary of Health as part of an STD and HIV prevention program, this practice was later discontinued because of a public outcry that it was ineffective and because of the Church\\x92s persistent objections.\\nThe situation for rural (barrios) youth is quite different. They learn and receive information about sex and sexual behavior from observing farm animals, from magazines, from clandestine \\x93boys only\\x94 meetings, and from the relations between parents and other family members in homes where there is little privacy. The prevailing Catholic dogma on sexual morality is written deep in the unconsciousness of every boy and girl. Only a few years ago, 98 percent of the youth associated premarital sex with guilt and sin. Only recently has this begun to change. In 1994, the Youth Adult Sexuality Survey (Zablan 1994) revealed that about 18 percent accepted premarital sex, although a majority of 80 percent still believed it was a sin and morally unacceptable.\\nOnly a few general surveys about the sexual life of younger Filipinos exist; most of what is known is based on anecdotal reports. The author\\x92s experiences are with interviews of preselected groups of the youth population conducted during periodic sojourns back to the Philippines. The samples mainly consist of middle-class youth, ages 17 to 22, who were encouraged to bring to the meeting problems related to their sexual lives and development. Repeatedly, they expressed regret that these aspects of their lives that engender so much anguish and fears could not be explicitly discussed in the intimacy of their household.\\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that first premarital sexual activities are initiated at an earlier age, especially for those in metropolitan areas, where the basic family structure often disintegrates because of a lack of parental supervision, with both parents working or the father absent and perhaps working overseas. Young males pursuing college and graduate studies in the city are often detached from parental supervision and frequently succumb to the lure of metropolitan temptations, go-go bars, and adultentertainment houses. Twenty to 25 percent have their first sexual experiences with prostitutes, either out of peer pressure or curiosity. In a few cases, youths in smaller communities who impregnate their girlfriends may be forced to marry them or make an amicable financial arrangement with parental approval. The woman usually keeps the child in her parents\\x92 home instead of giving it up for adoption.\\nIn the Muslim communities, premarital sex is absolutely prohibited. But young girls, ages 14 to 16, can be betrothed through the usual (parental) marriage arrangement, mainly to affluent and much older bridegrooms.\\nAmong girls, the memories of being deflowered were somewhat different from those of the boys. Because of guilt and shame, the majority of young females did not bother to get prior information about sexual intercourse and the possible consequences of their first sexual encounters. They perceived their first intercourse as the fulfillment of young love, motivated by peer pressure to keep their boyfriends, and at the same time as a \\x93challenge\\x94 to parental authority or a gross transgression of a religious or social taboo. For the well-educated and sophisticated city dwellers, it was a calculated act to get rid of the old-fashioned social taboo (virginity), which they perceived as an obstacle to entering into a more mature and fulfilling sexual life, or plainly to catch the men of their dreams. It is interesting to note that, compared with the United States and other industrialized nations, Filipino teenagers are probably less sexually active; thus teenage pregnancy is less of a problem than elsewhere.\\nMost of the children born to single mothers are kept in the teenager\\x92s mother\\x92s home, instead of being given up for adoption. In the 1970s, a pregnant teenager was a social outcast and was subjected to severe parental scorn. However, in the 1990s, because of Western influence and financial difficulties, a pregnant teenager is somewhat more tolerated, and her parents are less condemning and more accepting of any financial help the teenage father might offer.\\nC. Adults\\nCourtship, Dating, and Relationships\\nAs mentioned previously, Chinese influence runs deep and the majority of Filipinas adhere to its simple social dictum, \\x93Get married at a marriageable age.\\x94 Marriage is considered the natural conclusion of a stable heterosexual relationship. Recently, however, Filipinos have started to replace their old-fashioned social concepts with ones that recognize that the right to remain single is as much a personal right as the right to marry. Because of the Western influence on women\\x92s liberation, to be a single older woman is no longer considered a social disgrace or the result of any personal inadequacy.\\nCohabitation\\nThe colonial view of the sacredness of marriage includes a strong social condemnation of cohabitation for unmarried couples. Thus, cohabitation was relatively rare during the 1940s. The social and legal implications of \\x93common-law marriage\\x94 (cohabitation) are not significant in a society of less affluence and resources. Furthermore, the definition of unmarried used in compiling official statistics makes it difficult to estimate the popularity of this behavior in the sense it is understood in the Western Hemisphere. Beginning in the late 1980s, the increased tolerance of non-marital cohabitation in the West began to influence the middle-aged and younger generations. During the author\\x92s 1996 visit in the provinces of Cebu, Leyte, and metropolitan Manila, there was an estimated increase of half a percent and an estimated 340,000 couples in unmarried cohabitation. The majority of cohabiting couples in the provinces are separated from their legal spouses because divorce is illegal and they cannot be civilly or religiously married. The rest are college students, youth, artists, and intellectuals who are attracted to this lifestyle.\\nCourtship is a cherished Filipino tradition with certain specific rules based on religious, sociocultural, and family values. There are five widely shared rules or \\x93commandments\\x94 associated with courtship:\\nSay \\x93yes\\x94 to the first invitation.\\nIt is a prerequisite to have an escort, either a friend or next of kin, on the first date (no escort is necessary for a woman 28 years or older.\\nIt is all right to publicly demonstrate decent affection, such as kissing, touching, and caressing.\\nA young Filipina should reserve criticism after the first date, be discreet about her feelings, and the man must cover (pay for) all expenses.\\nIf dating leads to marriage, one must remember that marrying entails marrying into the spouse\\x92s whole family as a clan.\\nThe majority of young men and women believe that love, physical attraction, similar religious beliefs, and trust are the basic essentials in creating and maintaining a stable relationship.\\nAdults, Marriage, and the Family\\nThe marriage ceremony is usually preceded by an engagement. For the rich and middle class, betrothal is marked with elaborate parties. On the other hand, the low-income class concludes the occasion with a firm handshake and/or a sip of a local wine or homemade ferment. The engagement and wedding are usually a happy, festive occasion. However, if questions of family honor and shame arise, the outcome may be violent and deadly, as happened at the time of this writing, when a male\\x92s family massacred the bride-to-be\\x92s family because she slept with another man two days before the wedding. The community accepted the outcome as a proper punishment for the betrayal and unbearable shame caused to the bridegroom\\x92s family.\\nWhereas the legal age for voting is 21 years for both males and females, the legal age for marriage is 21 for males and 18 for females. In the Muslim community, the parents of a girl between ages 14 and 16 may betroth her to an older man. Generally, in the Christian community, the courts do not consider pregnancy a valid motive to grant permission for the marriage of a minor. Legislation has also abolished the possibility of reparatory marriage; in the past a person accused of rape or forceful abduction could avoid punishment by marrying the victim. In the southern end of the archipelago, where the majority of the Muslims live, a dowry is agreed on before a formal marriage arrangement is signed. The dowry, given by the bride\\x92s parents to the groom, may be a large sum of money, property, or a sizable wedding present.\\nMuslim marriages are conducted by a judge or an imam (a religious cleric), Christian marriages by a priest or pastor. Civil marriages are recognized and accepted in both the Christian and Muslim communities when conducted by judges and commercial chiefs, such as pilots and ship captains.\\nAlthough polygyny had a long history in pre-colonial Filipino civilization and was common in the Muslim community prior to the 1970s, polygynous marriages are the exception today. The majority of sophisticated, highly educated males, whether Muslim or Christian, choose to be monogamous for financial reasons. Middle- and upper-class Filipino families also elect to have fewer children, two on average, as compared to three or more for the less educated and low-income families.\\nWith the advance of information technology, foreigners seeking brides with traditional values can now surf the Internet for a modest fee. Companies also advertise \\x93mail order brides\\x94 in different magazines and specialty journals. There are currently about 100 companies competing to lure mail-order bride customers, such as \\x93Cherry Blossoms,\\x94 \\x93Asian Rose,\\x94 and \\x93Exotic Girls.\\x94 The service charge can range from a basic $150 to upwards of $2,500. For $150, the bridegroom-to-be will receive a brief biographical sketch and a photo or video of the woman. He can correspond with her in letters or even phone calls. He can arrange to go to the Philippines and see her at his own expense. For $2,500, the services include airfare, hotel accommodations, and a two- or three-day tour to personally interact with the candidate bride(s). The client is introduced to different women during a party and the couples can interact socially.\\nA major shortcoming of this venue for finding a mate is that the interested males are not screened properly. These men can be psychopaths, criminals, or worse. In some cases, a syndicate of \\x93Internet bride-merchants\\x94 sells young women aged 14 to 18, oftentimes with fake birth certificates, for a mere $3,000. These women are admitted to the United States on a fianc�e\\x92s visa. Parents with severe income hardship frequently sign the contract believing that their daughters will either be given a job opportunity or be future brides of these unscrupulous foreigners. Recently, a congressman from the state of New Jersey sponsored a bill in the United States Congress to severely restrict the issuing of these \\x93fianc�e\\x92s visas\\x94 and to stop the practice of \\x93bride-to-be/sex slave\\x94 businesses. Newspaper reports and embassy communiqu�s have documented that many young Filipino mailorder and Internet brides are held captive, raped, divorced, and then pressed into prostitution.\\nThere are no credible published data on marital sexual satisfaction or on the status of Filipino marital life. According to the author\\x92s informal survey and radio-talk-show interviews in 1995, 15 to 20 percent of Filipinos are unhappily married. Women, more often than men, reported having sexual intercourse not because they desired it, but to please their spouses. Whereas 35 percent of males would like to increase the frequency of sexual intercourse, especially those in their 20s and 30s, most of the women were satisfied with the frequency of sex; only 5 percent of the females were interested in more frequent sex. These gender differences may be explained as the result of a greater pressure on males for sexual performance to maintain their macho image and maintain total control over women.\\nA majority of women complained of the brief duration of foreplay and premature ejaculation. Sexual intercourse is limited almost exclusively to penetration, which is more common among the less educated, more devotedly religious couples, and the older age groups. The average duration of foreplay is about five minutes, that of coitus about five to six minutes. On the other hand, the more educated, sophisticated, younger age group, and the \\x93unchurched\\x94 have a longer duration of sexual foreplay and coitus, about twenty-two minutes. Although premature ejaculation is not uncommon among males, very few men seek medical help. Husbands generally do not consider premature (early) ejaculation a problem.\\nIn the Christian community, sexual activity is not prohibited during any religious event or celebration. In some cases, Christian women make the personal choice of not having sex during their menstrual period. On the other hand, Muslim custom does not allow any sexual activity during the menstrual period, between sundown Friday and sundown Saturday, and during Ramadan, the month-long period of daytime fasting.\\nIt is difficult to gather data on female orgasm because of religious repression and personal shyness. It is believed that Filipinas\\x92 sexual satisfaction is based on cultural and religious grounds. The husband\\x92s satisfaction is primary and the wife\\x92s orgasm clearly secondary. Young, educated, and less religious or unchurched women have a higher orgasmic rate as compared to their older, less-educated, (oftentimes) more religious, and shy counterparts. It is believed that for a majority of women who experienced orgasms, it was more a result of psychological and religious expectation and not so much because of oral or manual genital stimulation. However, the barrage of media and Western influences has increased the proportion of Filipinas who prefer both psychic and physical stimulation. Filipinas are bombarded by the mass media and performing arts with messages about more openness in sexual matters, greater gender equality, information about new techniques for lovemaking, new roles within the couple, and new opportunities for extramarital relationships. These issues are also conversation matter among friends and families, at business meetings, and at almost any social-civic gatherings.\\nDivorce and Remarriage\\nThe Catholic Church does not allow divorce of any kind, but it will grant annulments, which most Filipinos find socially distasteful. However, generally, we find civil decrees of legal separation, divorce, and annulment are becoming more socially acceptable for Christian and Muslim Filipinos. A civil divorce requires that the ex-husband support the children and provide some assistance to the ex-wife along with household maintenance.\\nSlightly more acceptable are consensual separations. What is popular today is having a court declare a marriage null and void under the Family Code (Executive order 209, article 36). The Family Code has adopted the grounds of \\x93psychological incompatibility\\x94 as a basis for civil annulments. This was the criterion for annulment articulated by the Catholic Church forty years ago after the Vatican II Council, when annulments became much more common. A civil annulment dissolves the marriage and leaves both parties free to remarry. With the incidence of annulments clearly increasing in the mid-1990s, Filipino Senator A. D. (Nikki) Coseteng introduced in the legislature a pro-marriage anti-divorce bill (no. 179), which now legally defines marriage as an inviolable social institution and the foundation of the family.\\nThe incidence of remarriage is not presently known. However, both in the rural and metropolitan areas, cohabitation is on the upswing because of Western influences and financial problems. In major cities, younger, more sophisticated, and affluent women have more chances for remarriage, but priests will not officiate at a second marriage ceremony unless the Catholic Church has annulled the previous marriage. Despite liberalization in the dissolution or annulment of marriages, the main reason why the divorce rate is still relatively low, when compared to the industrialized countries, is most likely the pervasive influence of the Catholic Church and parental moral values. The importance of extended family norms derives, not only as a source of emotional support and the context for the development of profound personal relations, but also for many other aspects of social life, from financial support to finding a job. Legal separation, divorce, and annulment are still frequently perceived as evidence of personal failure and as a \\x93social anomaly.\\x94 The end of the relationship is not viewed as freedom and independence, but as the beginning of a different period in one\\x92s personal life.\\nExtramarital Sexual Activities\\nMost of the causes of legal separation involve extramarital affairs. Adultery or extramarital sex is vehemently condemned by the Catholic Church and is socially detested. However, there is an issue of legal terminology and social definition. Under Filipino penal laws, a man does not commit adultery unless he violates the law against concubinage. To be guilty of concubinage, a man must:\\nkeep a mistress within the conjugal dwelling;\\nhave sexual intercourse with another woman under scandalous circumstances; or\\ncohabit with another woman outside the conjugal dwelling.\\nHaving sexual intercourse with a women who is not one\\x92s wife does not in itself violate the law of concubinage. Nor is the ban on concubinage violated if a man fathers a child with a woman who is not his wife. A wife commits adultery simply by having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband, regardless of the circumstances.\\nThe provisions of the Penal Code on female adultery and male concubinage are glaring examples, not only of the inequality between the sexes, but also of the inequity between erring spouses. The law provides a maximum penalty of four years imprisonment for the erring husband. The concubine shall be meted a penalty of destierro, wherein she is prohibited from setting foot within the man\\x92s residence. A wife found guilty of adultery, on the other hand, may be imprisoned for a maximum period of six years. Some lawmakers have pointed out that it is easier to send a female to jail and that this violates the constitutional provision on equality of the sexes. In simple terms, the law does not criminalize the sexual infidelity of a married man except under certain circumstances. This, some lawmakers point out, seems to imply that the extramarital affairs of men are acceptable as long as they are discreet in handling them - a clear reflection of the double standard mentality of society with regard to sexual infidelity.\\nA 1996 survey conducted by an advertising and research group revealed that out of 485 married men in metropolitan Manila, 51 percent admitted having had extramarital affairs. The survey results reflect the machismo culture in the Philippines, wherein a man\\x92s worth, among other things, is also equated with his ability to lure other women. In an attempt to correct this inequality in 1997, Senator M. Santiago filed a bill simplifying marital infidelity. In her measure, she proposed that the extramarital sex by either the husband or wife be called adultery, whether the extramarital partner is of the other or same sex. The House committee made amendments to her bill and put the marital offense under a single crime called \\x93marital infidelity,\\x94 eliminating the separate provisions on concubinage and adultery, and the consideration of whether the infidelity occurs within the couple\\x92s home or elsewhere. Congress proposed a maximum penalty of six years for all parties concerned. Speaking for the Women\\x92s Legal Bureau, a non-governmental organization (NGO), E. Ursua claimed that imposing criminal liability on the offenders is not the answer. \\x93We do not think criminalizing is the proper solution. We can\\x92t force someone to be faithful.\\x94\\nThe new law penalizes the guilty party with imprisonment, regardless of the reasons behind the infidelity. A woman escaping from an abusive or violent relationship, or one who simply falls out of love and finds growth and fulfillment with another person, is treated no differently than a man who keeps several mistresses. In effect, the law also punishes individuals who get out of marriages that are bereft of love, respect, and trust. Some legal organizations propose a modified \\x93divorce\\x94 law and/or a new bill to decriminalize sexual infidelity. But Senator Santiago countered that this might send a \\x93subliminal message\\x94 to the youth that the state is encouraging \\x93free love.\\x94\\nIn the Muslim world, adultery is severely punished, with the perpetrators either made social outcasts or, in rural villages, stoned to death in public. This \\x93fatal justice\\x94 is carried out clandestinely as an expression of community justice that government magistrates (datu) can do nothing to either prevent or punish. The whole village maintains a \\x93code of silence,\\x94 because this punishment is written in the Muslim moral marital law. There is no witness to interrogate or testify.\\nDuring the Spanish colonial days, 1775 to 1899, rich Filipinos who owned haciendas (estates or a large parcel of land) and employed several female domestic helpers could easily have extramarital relations with their female employees, with or without the knowledge of their wives. Today, we still find married men in all walks of life who maintain a long-standing relationship with a second woman, oftentimes with the knowledge and approval of their spouses, and even of their grown children. In some cases, an extramarital affair can end a politician\\x92s career; in other cases, an affair, even when its makes headlines, may have no political consequences. Some couples find extramarital affairs a solution that keeps their marriage alive. The man may be freed to satisfy sexual needs he does not dare, because of religious restrictions, reveal to his wife, while the wife is relieved of any pressure to change her sexual behavior. Most wives who adopt this compromise have limited horizons in their lives and a very low sexual appetite. Less common is a marriage in which both the husband and wife have extramarital relationships by mutual knowledge and agreement. In such cases, usually the husband has a job that keeps him abroad for long periods of time, with periodic visits to wife and family. Occasionally, Filipinos who married, found employment abroad, immigrated for a few years, and married a second woman while abroad, bring their second wives back when they return and set up a second household in a different dwelling. Discovery of this bigamous affair can be costly if the courts become involved. Legal penalties for bigamy can bring up to four years in prison and fines for moral and psychological damages between $500 and $1,300 US.\\nThese relationships pose a serious problem in Philippine society because many of these men resist the use of condoms, do not practice safe sex, and pay no attention to the possibility that their regular or occasional partner(s) may be HIV-positive.\\nIncidence of Oral and Anal Sex\\nBoth the Christian and Islamic sects abhor oral and anal sex acts. The Muslim tradition specifically requires the husband to enter the wife by natural means in penile-vaginal intercourse. Oral sex, which in the past was condemned as \\x93unnatural,\\x94 is practiced more or less by educated Christians who live in the metropolitan areas. From the 1950s to the 1970s, when there was no constant supply on electricity in many towns and areas of the country, professional couples enhanced their sexual lives by using pornographic and specialty magazines. In the 1970s and 1980s, with electricity more widely available, middle-class and upper-class couples used film projectors, and later videocassette players, to enhance their sexual repertoire and learn about alternatives to penile-vaginal intercourse that could bring renewed vigor to their routine sex lives.\\nAnecdotal reports suggest that oral sex is practiced by 10 to 15 percent and tried by 20 percent of the professional couples (i.e., doctors, lawyers, and businesspersons who travel a lot). The majority of Filipinos, however, still consider oral sex as dirty and unnatural. For the few who engage in oral sex, cunnilingus is acceptable, but Filipinas will only very rarely engage in fellatio. In general, older and lower-class Filipinos have a more negative view of oral and anal sex.\\nModern Filipino youth, however, seem to be taking a new look at Westernized sexual expressions, according to what they said at the author\\x92s impromptu meetings. Although no general survey data are available, a segmental study of metropolitan youths revealed two groups of young women based on their responses. One group accepts and practices oral sex as a way of avoiding the risk of pregnancy, maintaining their technical virginity until marriage, and/or as a form of safer sex. For the second group, oral sex was a more intimate form of sexual relationship, somehow more \\x93romantic\\x94 than genital intercourse. Youths holding the latter view believed that oral sex should be only engaged in with a stable (engaged to be married) partner and not in the first few exploratory encounters or dates. Some other older girls joined some boys in rejecting this way of expressing love, and thought that only prostitutes could practice fellatio on boys.\\nWhereas anal intercourse is not part of the fantasies for the majority of devout Christian women, anecdotal reports revealed that 30 to 40 percent of males fantasized about having anal sex with women other than their wives. Prejudices against anal sex are even stronger in less educated youths. Most of the youths I spoke with do not accept anal sex even after marriage, perhaps influenced by the increasing incidence of AIDS in the Orient. Older boys agreed that a woman will never ask for it.\\nIES - Countries - The Philippines  - Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\\n', 134]\n",

Aquino penned Executive Order No. 118 creating the  Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts. Five years later, in 1992, this  presidential directive was enacted into law-- Republic  Act 7356 , creating the National Commission for Culture and the  Arts (NCCA). The original bill was jointly authored by Senators Edgardo Angara,  Heherson Alvarez, Leticia Ramos Shahani, and Congressman Carlos Padilla.\\nThe National Commission for  Culture and the Arts (NCCA), Philippines is the overall policy  making body, coordinating, and grants giving agency for the preservation,  development and promotion of Philippine arts and culture; an executing agency  for the policies it formulates; and task to administering the National  Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA) -- fund exclusively for  the implementation of culture and arts programs and  projects.\\nThe  government’s support for cultural development is particularly highlighted by  the passage of R.A. 7356 that created the NCCA.

Further,  through Republic Act No. 9155, administratively attached the earlier  aforementioned five cultural agencies to the NCCA, including now the Komisyon  sa Wikang Filipino / Commission on the Filipino  Language . Thus, the NCCA is responsible for culture and the arts in  the Philippines --- and, if not in the name, the de facto Ministry  of Culture.\\nThe  Commission together with the six cultural agencies works with the principle of  partnership, collaboration and shared responsibility in achieving effectively  and efficiently the implementation of cultural programs as well as maximizing  of resources.\\nThe NCCA was created to serve as the presidential  inter-agency commission to coordinate cultural policies and programs.\\nIV.

      "[0.00015072387266104953, 'Jose Rizal       dedicated his novel, \"El Filibusterismo\" to the three       priests, Mariano Gomez, 85 years, Jose Burgos, 30, and Jacinto       Zamora, 35, executed at Bagumbayan Field on February 17, 1872.\\nHistory books state that with this tragic       event, Philippine nationalism was born. The assumption is that,       before this date, the people did not feel they were one nation,       and any sign of protest against the foreign presence that was       Spain was a localized act of rebellion to which the rest of the       country did not relate.\\nThe execution of three Filipino       priests, one of them an octogenarian, for something nobody believed       they had anything to do with in the first place, stirred a current       of sympathy for the martyrs and of revulsion against the alien       rulers who could bring the ax down on the necks of the innocent.       After three and a half centuries of foreign domination characterized       by unenlightened government, outright exploitation of people       and natural resources, now and then half-hearted attempts at       reform and, on the part of the governed, sporadic and desultory       shows of resistance, the common enemy now took shape and the       people felt as one in their fight for the right to rule themselves,       shape their own destinies, and take the consequences.\\nFather Gomez, Father Burgos and Father       Zamora were summarily tried and sentenced to death by the garrote       for the Cavite arsenal revolt of January 20, 1872. The priests,       who were active in the fight for the secularization (or, in effect,       nationalization) of the clergy were creating trouble for the       despotic Governor Rafael Izquierdo and the powerful regular religious       orders in the country. By linking them with the uprising in the       Cavite arsenal, whether they indeed had anything to do with it       or not, the administration found a convenient way of doing away       with the troublesome trio.\\nWere the three really involved in the uprising?       Establishing the truth of the case will take painstaking investigation       since the records of the trial have disappeared and the star       prosecution witness himself had been ordered executed along with       the three against whom he testified. The question will probably       remain one of the great unsolved mysteries in the Filipinos\\'       fight for freedom. Until he breathed his last, Father Burgos       protested innocence of the crime imputed to him and Rizal, in       dedicating the Filibusterismo to the three condemned men,       underscored the doubt shared by the Filipinos over their guilt.\\nMsgr. Meliton Martinez, Archbishop of Manila,       was served a copy of the death sentences with a request that       the priests be defrocked. In reply, the archbishop said he needed       more convincing proof of their guilt and refused to be instrumental in effecting the crowning touch to their humiliation.\\nThe secrecy which shrouded the alleged       trials, the mysterious way records and papers of the court martial       findings had disappeared, and the suspicious haste with which       the sentences were carried out, contributed to the widespread       belief that the three had been condemned on trumped-up charges.       Sentenced to death on February 15, they were led to the garrote       two days later, on February 17.\\nBut even if irrefutable evidence against       Father Gomez, Burgos and Zamora had been cited, the three \\xad one an octogenarian known for the charities, another turned half-crazed       at the prospect of a ghastly death, and the third widely admired       for his courageous espousal of the rights of the Filipinos, in       particular the clergy \\xad would just the same have been looked       on as martyrs by their compatriots. The time was ripe for revolt       and the fact that the people believed that the executions were       a miscarriage of justice only hastened the march of history.       Public indignation rose to a peak. The job became easier for       those who had by now seen the necessity of uniting. The first       seeds of nationalism were sown and took root. The then constituted       authorities, in deciding to set the priests up as an example       to the populace of what was in the store for them if they continued       being insolent, were fast sealing their doom. The groundwork       for the inevitable revolution that was to come a quarter of a       century later was laid.\\nEdmund Plauchut, a Frenchman residing in       Manila at the time of the revolt, gives a dispassionate account       of it and its causes in an article published in the Revue       des Deux Mondes in 1877. He traced the immediate cause to       a peremptory order from the governor, Izquierdo, exacting personal taxes from the Filipino laborers in the engineering and artillery       corps in the Cavite arsenal, and requiring them to perform forced       labor like ordinary subjects. Until then, these workers in the       arsenal had been enjoying exemptions from both taxes and forced       labor. January 20, the day of the revolt, was payday and the       laborers found the amount of taxes as well as the corresponding       fee in lieu of the forced labor deducted from their pay envelopes.       It was the last straw. That night they mutinied. Forty infantry       soldiers and twenty men from the artillery took over command       of the Fort of San Felipe and fired cannonades to announce to       the world their moment of triumph. It was a short-lived victory.       Apparently, the mutineers had expected to be joined by their       comrades in the 7th infantry company assigned to patrol the Cavite       plaza. They became terror-stricken, however, when they beckoned       to the 7th infantry men from the ramparts of the fort and their       comrades did not make any move to join them. Instead, the company       started attacking them. The rebels decided to bolt the gates       and wait for morning when support from Manila was expected to       come.\\nBut Manila was quiet. What the Cavite rebels       had mistaken for a pre-arranged signal for the uprising coming       from the general direction of the city, turned out to be the       burst of rockets in celebration of the feast of St. Loreto, patron       of Sampaloc. Augustinian Friar Casimiro Herrera, writing a thesis       on the revolt later, was to say this was an \"act of Divine       Providence\", for the Sampaloc fiesta, traditionally celebrated       in December, had been postponed to January 20 that year.\\nInformed of the mutiny, Governor Izquierdo       dispatched two infantry regiments and an artillery brigade with       four cannons, under the command of General Felipe Ginoves Expinar.       General Ginoves arrived in Cavite by sea on the boats of Filipino,       Manila, Isabel I and Isabel II, to find the 7th infantry company       under the command of Lt. Col. Sawa successfully keeping the rebels       at bay in the front. From then on, it was just a matter of hours       before the mutineers, out-numbered, out-armed and ill-prepared       even in the matter of provisions to enable them to weather a       siege, began filing out of the fort waving the white banner of       surrender. But the first to march out were met by a volley of       shots from General Ginoves\\' men. They fell to a man and Gen.       Ginoves then ordered a charge into the fort. The rebels inside       the fort did not offer any resistance. Plauchut mentions a Spanish       friar (Father Antonio Ruffian of San Jose de Dios) whose presence       inside the fort \"has never been explained to date\",       as well as the Filipinos and the suicide of one of them. This       would tend to corroborate reports from other sources that the       Spanish officers in the fort as well as the men under them had       joined with the laborers in the revolt. These reports mention       Spanish Lts. Montesinos and Morquecho, who with a Sgt. Lamadrid,       took charge of the force of 200 marines and artillery men at       the arsenal. When General Ginoves and his soldiers arrived, it       was Sgt. Lamadrid who first tried to repel them. He died in the       attempt. Other accounts, however, conflict with these reports.       They state that the rebels themselves put to death the Spanish       officers inside the fort, as well as the wife of one of them       and her maid.\\nThat those who staged the revolt in the       San Felipe fort were counting on help from comrades in other       military establishments in Cavite and Manila is highly plausible.       The native soldiers in these establishments had long been chafing       from discrimination in treatment. One of Governor\\'s Izquierdo\\'s       first acts on taking over the reins of the government was to       order the fusion of the two artillery battalions in Manila. One       of these was composed of Spaniards (peninsulars) and the       other of mestizos and Filipinos. Before the fusion, the two battalions       were being maintained separately and independently of each other       to avoid clashes that would arise because of the differences       in race. Governor Izquierdo not only ordered the two merged,       but decreed that the peninsulars would form the first       companies and the Filipinos, second. He also filled all vacancies       for the posts of corporals and sergeants with Spaniards. When       the two battalions were being maintained separately, the natives       were blissfully unaware of the fact that their Spanish comrades       in other battalions were getting better pay and better food.       With the merger, the discriminations became obvious. The feeling       of discontent spread. The Cavite uprising was one of the manifestations       of this dissatisfaction over conditions in the army. It could       very well have been part of a concerted plan to revolt among       the native elements in the rest of the military establishments.\\nWhen he quickly quelled the revolt, Governor       Izquierdo demonstrated the futility of mutiny. He should have       rested on his laurels, assured that the other discontented groups       contemplating similar acts of defiance would have learned their       lesson and desisted from resorting to violence. But Governor       Izquierdo had to turn the incident into a terrible example that       the insolent filibusters (as anyone who showed any radical tendencies       was then called) should never forget. Apparently, Governor Izquierdo       had a dossier on who the filibusters were. He had them all rounded       up, their homes searched thoroughly and their letters intercepted.       The Council of War set up a court martial under Manuel Boscasa.       Some seventy people were condemned to death. Later, several of       the death sentences were commuted to exile or imprisonment. Among       those banished to far off and lonely Marianas Islands were Antonio       Maria Regidor, Maximo Paterno. Agustin Mendoza and Joaquin Pardo       de Tavera. Given jail terms were Maximo Inocencio, Enrique Paraiso       and Crisanto de los Reyes. Doomed to the garrote were the three       priests, Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, as well as one Francisco       Saldua. The latter had been the principal informer against the       three priests. His statement had been the main basis for the       convictions and he had been promised pardon in exchange for his       testimony. To his consternation, however, he was condemned along       with the three. His was the first of the heads to roll on February       17.\\nThe court martial proceedings appear to       be highly anomalous. Evidence to support the charges did not       accompany the decision which merely stated that the court had       found them guilty of conspiring to overthrow the government and       proclaim a Republic of the Philippines, with Father Burgos as       president. The defendants were given a counsel chosen by the       court. The counsel, a Dr. Jose Arrieta, on reading his brief,       said it was not possible to defend Father Burgos because he had       already confessed. The priest was surprised on hearing the \"defense\".       He protested, \"That is not my defense. The course has changed       it. I have not confessed and I deny every charge brought against       me as having no foundation in fact or in act.\"\\nThat Governor Izquierdo committed a blunder       when he had the priests executed and the other suspects exiled       or otherwise sentenced for scarcely proved complicity in the       Cavite revolt, is something that most historians admit. If Governor       Izquierdo had desisted from such punitive action, the revolt       would not have attained the importance it was to take on subsequently.       One may not guarantee, however, that otherwise, the fire of nationalism       would not have caught on and spread. As it happened, with the       execution of the three priests, Governor Izquierdo was merely       setting the pattern for his reign of terror, only too well known       in Philippine history. The fuse was ready, all that remained       to be done was set it off.\\nAbroad, events had in fact been working       up to the Cavite revolt. Spain herself had just undergone a revolution.       Four years earlier, in 1868, the queen had been dethroned and       a Republican had been installed. The revolution in the mother       country had repercussions in the Islands. In 1869, the liberal       Governor de la Torre was sent over. All progressive-minded elements       in the country were to enjoy a brief spell of liberalism under       the new governor. There was going to be freedom of speech and       the Governor even encouraged his subjects to visit with him at       his Sta. Potenciana palace and exchange views on how the government       should be run. The loss of Spanish colonies in the Americas at       about this time resulted in the displacements of a great number       of government officials and employees. These were soon to find       their way to the only colony left, the Philippine Islands. The       opening of the Suez Canal was to facilitate this influx of newcomers       who were to bring with them modern ideas of government and the       spirit of reforms then pervading in the mother country as well       as throughout Europe and the new world.\\nOne articulate       historian writes of the period. Not until the nineteenth century       would the Filipino nation present a united, self-conscious front.       The rarefied air from Europe had found its way into the nipa       hut. The red beret of the liberated Frenchman had its counterpart       in the red ribbon worn by the Señora Maria de Sanchez,       hostess of the Manila celebration of the new Spanish constitution.       Pouring in lieu of the invalid wife of the liberal Governor de       la Torre, she presented a strange, exciting sight to the heretofore       repressed Filipino. On the ribbon wound around her hair were       printed the words \"Long Live the Sovereign People\" and around her neck a red tie bore the message \"Long Live       Liberty\" at one end, and \"Long live General la Torre\" on the other. On a frivolous ribbon around a Castillian señora\\'s       hair was the slogan that would send many a Filipino who was present       at the reception, among them Father Jose Burgos, to jail or to       the garrote.\\nBut liberalism was not going to last long       in Spain, and certain circles in the Islands, who looked on the       radical ways of Governor de la Torre as a serious threat to their       existence, were going to conspire to have him removed. These       circles were typified by the Augustinian friar, Herrero, who,       assuming an \"I told you so\" attitude in his thesis       on the Cavite revolt, was to say later, \"The insurrection       at Cavite has the same origin and result as those in France,       Spain, Italy, American and other European countries. They are       all fruits of the corruption of the intelligence and of the heart       . . . The freedom to think and the freedom of the press which       brought bitter fruits in Spain were transported to these islands       and they were encouraged by ambition, passions and ignorance       of men . . . \"\\nOn April 4,, 1871, De la Torre was replaced       by Izquierdo. The moment the new governor took over the reins       of government, he made it clear that the regime he was going       to establish was one of total reaction to De la Torre\\'s liberal       policies. But the seeds of liberalism and of desire for reform       had been sown and these were to thrive, even more so, under Izquierdo\\'s       oppressive rule. It is a lesson of history that revolutionary       movements feed on tyranny.\\nFather Burgos, then a coadjutor in the       Manila Cathedral, had been very active in the fight for the retention       of Filipino curas in parishes. This dispute over parishes       between the seculars (the curas) and the regulars (members of       religious order) is best explained in a letter Archbishop Martinez       of Manila sent the Regent of the King in Madrid at the height       of the dispute, shortly before the Cavite revolt. The archbishop,       as head of the parishes, naturally sided with the seculars and       warned that the controversy had better be resolved to their satisfaction       if it was desired to stave off a deterioration of the situation       with unfortunate results. Because the seculars were native priests, mestizos or creoles, and the regulars were peninsulars,       the dispute over the parishes was eventually to take on racial       overtones.\\nArchbishop Martinez traced the beginnings       of the religious question to the issuance of the Cedula of July       8, 1826. This ecclesiastical order emanation from Madrid authorized       the transfer of administration of the parishes in the Islands       from the seculars to the regulars. The seculars had been occupying       these parishes since fifty years ago, when there was a shortage       of priests from Spain. Few of the Spanish priests like the idea       of coming to the wilds of the Philippines, and the local church       authorities were forced to train natives to become priests and       administer the parishes. The 1826 cedula naturally affected the       seculars adversely, since then they were to be demoted to mere       auxiliaries and sacristanes while the friars were to take       over as heads of the parishes. In almost all instances, however,       there was virtually no transfer of work: the native priests still       carried on the actual work of the curas, while the friars,       enjoying the privileges of curas, only took charge of       the soft job of receiving the moneys due the curates from the       parishioners. A second Cedula issued on March 9, 1849, authorized       the transfer of seven specific parishes in Cavite from the seculars       to the regulars. The last straw was the Royal Order of September       10, 1861 giving all curates in Cavite and Manila to the members       of the Recollect Order. The Royal Order was issued to recompense       the Recollects for loss of benefices in Mindanao which had been       given to the Jesuits, just returned from exile. The Jesuits,       banned from Spain and the Indies (the Philippines included) in       1767, were restored to favor in 1861. There were limited to missionary       work, however, and in the Islands were assigned to Mindanao,       then in the administration of the Recollects. To compensate the       Recollects, they were awarded the lucrative parishes in Manila       and Cavite at the expense of the native clergy which had hitherto       been holding them.\\nThere were other instances of what the       historians of the time called despoliation, which was the awarding       of lush plums to favored parties to the discrimination of underdogs.       When the priest of San Rafael, Bulacan, a native, died, his curate       was given over to the Augustinians. Curates of Zambales, Bataan       and Pampanga, long held by native priests, were given over to       religious corporations. Father Burgos led the protests against       what he charged were intrusions on the part of the regulars into       what properly and legally belonged to the local clergy. He organized       a clerical party to fight for secularization. The party subsidized       the newspaper El Eco Filipino, published in Madrid, which       became the organ of the champions for secularization of the churches       and later of civil reforms. Burgos and his followers argued that       the turning over of the parishes to the regulars contravened       the provisions of the Council of Trent agreement which expressly       prohibited the friars from holding curates. Under the Trent agreement,       only secular priests were supposed to hold parishes and administer       the spiritual needs of the populace while regulars were to live       in their monasteries and devote their time to religious contemplation       and to missionary and educational work.\\nThe regulars on the other hand countered       that the seculars were not competent to hold the parishes and       that, moreover, they had been holding these curates at the indulgence       of the Crown in Madrid which had the right to take away at its       pleasure. What really made the curates such a big bone of contention,       besides of course the fact that they were good sources of revenues,       was the fact that those holding them became spheres of influence,       social and political, in the communities. The regulars, realizing       that they would be reduced to political impotence if they retired       to their monasteries, refused to give up the parishes that they       had maneuvered to get from the native priests through high-powered       and obviously successful lobbying in Madrid. It was this friar       faction which believed to have insisted on laying the extreme       penalty for Father Burgos, his fellow cura del sagrario in the Cathedral, Jacinto Zamora, and the octogenarian Gomez,       for complicity in the Cavite Revolt. In one fell swoop, they       would do away with an annoying threat to the comfortable positions       they had been able to wangle from Madrid, as heads of the most       lucrative parishes in the Islands.\\nBut the stories circulated that the evidence       against the three priests had been fabricated, and that in fact       the revolt had been instigated by the friars (Friar Ruffian\\'s       presence in the besieged fort San Felipe was never satisfactorily       explained) to frame up Burgos, Gomez and Zamora. One take (noted       in Blair and Robertson\\'s The Philippine Islands Vol. 11)       was that some friars had brought from Zambales a native who looked       like Father Gomez, rigged him up in priest attire and thus managed       to implicate the good man in the mutiny.\\nThese stories were to serve as fodder to       the steadily growing fire. Because those put to the garrote for       a crime never satisfactorily proved included a creole (Burgos),       a half-Chinese (Zamora) and a pure-blooded Tagalog (Gomez), the       various elements represented by these three races, saw in the       unjust execution a common cause which was not just creole, or       mestizo, or indio (as natives were then deprecatingly termed).       Up to then, these various groups had held each other in distrust,       a result of the \"divide and rule\" policy maintained       by most despotic regimes and so successfully practiced by the       peninsulars in the Islands. With the executions, Burgos, Zamora       and Gomez emerged as martyrs. The various active groups became       bound in anger over the atrocity and on this union was laid the       foundation for a Filipino nation. Some of the liberal elements       had been advocating mere assimilation with Spain (the country       to take on the status of a province). Now they were asking themselves       whether assimilation, and not complete independence to run their       lives and their country, was what they wanted.\\nAustin Craig in his Lineage, Life and       Labors of Rizal recalls that Father Burgos\\' ante mortem advice       to the Filipinos was for them to seek education abroad because       only through education could they hope for progress. It was advice       that was well taken. Rizal, whose older brother, Paciano, was       a close friend of Burgos, was soon to leave his native shores       for Madrid and other points overseas, where he was to crystallize       his ideas for reform.\\nMeantime,       the laymen who had also been implicated in the revolt and punished       with exile to the Marianas, were to escape to places like London,       Hongkong and Tokyo, where the air was much more progressive.       Here they were to start Filipino communities where many a plot       to liberate the \"patria adorada\" was very likely hatched.

Broad-based economic expansion was achieved in a low inflation environment,\" it said.\\nHefty remittances, which encouraged robust domestic consumption, along with steadfast growth in farm output, compensated for slower exports, economists said.\\n\"We had a very strong first half last year. It has slowed a bit in the second half on uncertainty over the US economy, but robust dollar remittances sustained the growth story,\" said Jonathan Ravelas, an economist at Banco de Oro-EPCI Inc.\\nFrom January to November, dollar remittances by Filipinos working abroad rose 14.1 percent from a year before to $13.1 billion.\\nThe central bank expects remittances coursed through banks to hit $14.3 billion in 2007, 10.8 percent more than the $12.9 billion sent home in 2006.\\nRemittances peak before Christmas as more than eight million Filipinos overseas send more money to their families at home to spend for the holidays.\\nThese inflows are also strengthening the peso, which last year gained 18.8 percent against the US dollar.\\nSTURDY FARM SECTOR\\nThe economy was also boosted by a resilient farm sector, which endured a prolonged dry spell to record 4.7 percent growth, within government\\'s projected growth range of 4.5-5.0 percent.\\nAgriculture accounts for about a fifth of the domestic economy.\\nThe government said agriculture grew 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, faster than the 1.6 percent expansion a year before. The boost came from a late surge in production of rice and corn, the country\\'s major food crops.\\n\"Domestic demand continued to be strong in the last quarter. We expect strong agriculture growth to be the supply-side driver of GDP growth,\" said Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING.\\nThe typical acceleration in exports in the last quarter \"is likely to make net exports less of a drag in GDP growth,\" he said.\\nIn the first 11 months of last year exports rose just 4.8 percent from a year before. The reduced target for the whole year is 8 percent.\\nElectronics exports, which accounted for 61.3 percent of total export earnings in November, fell to 2.42 billion dollars from 2.54 billion dollars a year earlier.\\n\"The steady appreciation of the peso has been hurting the competitiveness of Philippine exports,\" said David Cohen, chief economist at Action Economics Asia in Singapore.\\n\"As a result, China and other Asian exporters are getting more of the export activity.\"\\nWhile the economy breezed though the tumult in the financial markets last year, there will be more headwinds in 2008, some economists said.\\n\"The external environment will be quite challenging. We are seeing a modest deceleration of the economy as a result of slower export growth, a softening of domestic consumption partly due to rising inflation and partly due to a gradual deceleration of remittance growth,\" said Frederic Neumann, an economist of HSBC in Hong Kong.\\nHSBC is projecting 5.9 percent GDP growth in 2008.\\nBut the country\\'s improving fundamentals should cushion some of the external shocks, Neumann said.\\n\"What is remarkable, unlike previous downturns, is that the Philippine economy\\'s sound fundamentals will enable it to better ride out his year\\'s tough environment.\"\\nLOWER EXPORTS\\nEconomists agree that a recession in the US will be a drag on the Philippine economy.\\nThe Philippines, despite having diversified its export markets, still considers the US its main trading partner.\\n\"Exports will likely struggle in the first half as demand for electronics could exhibit a downturn on the back of slowing consumer demand, a consequence of the weakness in the US which, if it continues, will also hit the global economy,\" said Neumann.\\nAside from being a key export market, the US is also home to the lion\\'s share of overseas-based Filipinos who send money home.\\n\"A weakness in global demand will shrink the growth in remittances. It will take a bit of the steam out of remittance growth,\" said Neumann.\\nOther economists have a more positive view.\\n\"The picture is cloudy, but the recent moves by the US government and the Fed should make an impact in the coming months,\" said Cohen of Action Economics.\\nThe Philippine government\\'s push for increased spending this year should mitigate the effects of a global economic downturn, said Ravelas of Banco de Oro-EPCI.\\n\"Fiscal pump-priming activities should help temper the uncertainty because of increased global risks,\" he said.\\nThe peso\\'s strength, the government\\'s healthier finances, a credit rating outlook upgrade and low interest rates should also reduce the vulnerability of the economy.\\nMoody\\'s said Friday its outlook for the Philippines\\' key credit ratings and ceilings has been upgraded to positive from stable because of progress in stabilizing public-sector finances and the government\\'s easing dependence on external financing. Consequently, Moody\\'s also upgraded the outlook for its ratings for eight Philippine banks to positive from stable.\\nThe following are the forecasts for fourth-quarter, 2007 and 2008 GDP growth given by five economists.\\n-- Action Economics - 6.3 percent, 6.9 percent, 5.5 percent\\n-- Banco de Oro-EPCI - 6.5-7.0 percent, 6.5-7.0 percent, 6.5-7.0 percent\\n-- CIMB-GK - 5.8 percent, 6.7 percent, 5.1 percent\\n-- HSBC - 6.4 percent, 6.9 percent, 5.9 percent\\n-- ING Bank - 6.5 percent, 7.0 percent, 6.2 percent\\nCopyright 2011 Thomson Financial.

Madrasah is Arabic for �school.� Today, the program is being implemented in 16 regions nationwide.\\nSome 754 public elementary schools and at least 36 private primary schools all over the country are now teaching Islamic values, Arabic language and Muslim subjects like the Qur�an in addition to DepEd�s standard curriculum (basic subjects like English, mathematics, science, Filipino and Makabayan).\\nSoccsksargen (South Cotabato, North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani, and Gen.

Cagayan Valley public schools have yet to implement the Madrasah program.\\nThe department is developing the Madrasah curriculum for public high schools for implementation starting school year 2010-2011.\\nEducation Secretary Jesli A. Lapus said �mainstreaming Madrasah education in the basic education system was one of DepEd�s priority programs.�\\nHe said, �Through this enriched curriculum, the Filipino national identity is promoted even as the Muslim-Filipinos� cultural heritage is preserved.�\\nLapus stressed DepEd�s commitment to �provide quality education to all children irrespective of their religion or culture.�\\nExpansion\\nThis year, the government has set aside P200 million for Madrasah, the same amount as in 2008. In 2010, the initiative would need at least P600 million, said a DepEd budget report.\\nCiting the �marked expansion� of the Madrasah, Manaros Boransing, DepEd undersecretary for Muslim affairs, told the recent 5th Mindanao Educators� Congress in Butuan City that �finally, Muslims have a sense of belonging.�\\nHe said: �Before they felt they were only citizens of Mindanao. Along with the lumads and Christians, they now consider themselves citizens of the Philippines.�\\nIn many Muslim schools, �there is no unified curriculum. Many asatidz (teachers) are not professionally trained. Learning materials are insufficient. The quality of instruction is poor. Less than 20 percent of Muslim children are enrolled in the Madrasah. Many Muslim private schools are not recognized by the government,� Boransing said.\\nA DepEd report Boransing furnished the Philippine Daily Inquirer stated that �for years, Muslim education in the country has been dichotomized...On one hand are Muslim children in public schools and those in sectarian madaris on the other. The education received by Muslim children in public schools was not entirely sensitive to Islamic values and practices while the madaris did not follow the basic education curriculum.�\\nBoransing said the dichotomy resulted in problems like non-transferability of private madaris students to public schools and vice versa. Graduates of local Muslim schools were not competitive in the local job market because they lacked communication skills in the English language, technical skills and professional competence, he said.\\nBoransing said Madrasah �would provide Muslim children quality basic education that would be comparable with education given to non-Muslim learners.�\\nMadrasah�s basic components are Arabic language and Islamic values (Alive). The program has been adapted to the differing requirements of public schools, private madaris and Muslim out-of-school youth. Alive textbooks and teachers� manuals were developed in 2005 under a World Bank-Philippine government agreement.\\nTo ensure that asatidz have basic competencies in Arabic and Islamic studies, applicants have to pass qualifying examinations. The government is also developing teacher education courses like Diploma Course in Arabic Language and Islamic Studies and a four-year Bachelor in Science in Elementary Education degree (major in Arabic language and Islamic studies).\\nMost of the country�s 1,500-plus asatidz get a monthly honorarium of P5,000 from local government units.\\nOn the other hand, Alive for out-of-school youth and adults is being handled by mobile teachers of the Bureau of Alternative Learning System.\\nBoransing said �the number of Muslim out-of-school youth and adults in the country has increased. Also, the rate of school dropouts is highest in Muslim areas. This is a cause for serious concern, not only for their education but also peace and order issues in these communities.�\\nMeanwhile, DepEd has released P19.2 million in financial aid to 36 private madaris in Mindanao.\\nRecipient-schools include the Dhayfullah Islamic Institute and Jamiatu Muslim Mindanao in Marawi City, Sharif Awliya Academy and Datu Maguda Timan in Shariff Kabunsuan, Noorul Eilm Academy and Al-Azharie Academy Central School in Cotabato City, Banay-Banay Pilot Madrasah and Al Munawarra Islamic School in Davao City, and Wamy Academy in General Santos City, among others.\\nThe funds will cover teachers� salaries and improvement of school facilities, according to DepEd Order No. 81.\\nCopyright 2011 Philippine Daily Inquirer.

      "[0.00010787945081891143, 'Tweet\\nIn Filipino Librarian: The Philippines , Von Totanes asks why we refer to the country as The Philippines and not simply, Philippines.\\nAs a child, I once heard a speech of my grandfather in which he said , “The Philippines are your country and the only country God has given you,” and I asked my dad if this was simply a case of bad English. He said no, members of the older generation used the plural because in those days, the country was viewed as a collection of islands: our official name under the Americans was The Philippine Islands.\\nStarting where the revolutionaries of 1896-1898 had left off, the framers of the 1935 Constitution aimed to create a unitary state, one which emphasized the wholeness of the Philippines as a country, instead of the collection of islands referred to by the Americans. To be sure, the Americans themselves began the process of changing the reference to the Philippines from The Philippine Islands to The Philippines, specifically in the Philippine Autonomy Act or Jones Law, which served as the Organic Act or Constitution of the Philippines from 1916-1935:\\n(from the Jones Law):\\nWHEREAS it was never the intention of the people of the United States in the incipiency of the war with Spain to make it a war of conquest or for territorial aggrandizement; and\\nWHEREAS it is, as it has always been, the purpose of the people of the United States to withdraw their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize their independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein; and\\nWHEREAS for the speedy accomplishment of such purpose it is desirable to place in the hands of the people of the Philippines as large a control of their domestic affairs as can be given them without, in the meantime, impairing the exercise of the rights of sovereignty by the people of the United States, in order that, by the use and exercise of popular franchise and governmental powers, they may be the better prepared to fully assume the responsibilities and enjoy all the privileges of complete independence: Therefore\\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the provisions of this Act and the name “The Philippines” as used in this Act shall apply to and include the Philippine Islands ceded to the United States Government by the treaty of peace concluded between the United States and Spain on the eleventh day of April, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, the boundaries of which are set forth in Article III of said treaty, together with those islands embraced in the treaty between Spain and the United States concluded at Washington on the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred.\\nThus, what was used for convenience by the Americans was, for the framers of the 1935 charter, a conscious adoption of a new name, with very definite ideas about what the new reference implied:\\nARTICLE XVIII The Commonwealth and the Republic\\nSection. 1. The government established by this Constitution shall be known as the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Upon the final and complete withdrawal of the sovereignty of the United States and the proclamation of Philippine independence, the Commonwealth of the Philippines shall thenceforth be known as the Republic of the Philippines.\\nIn a sense, this was a reversion to “La Republica Filipina” although because of the change in dominant official languages from Spanish to English, the sense is still different. Under the First Republic, we were “The Philippine Republic,” which is more in keeping with the sense of the Malolos Constitution that the Philippines comprised the political union of The Filipinos:\\nTHE REPUBLIC\\nArticle 1. The political association of all Filipinos constitutes a nation, whose state shall be known as the Philippine Republic.\\nThis is an important distinction first pointed out to me by a French historian. According to him, you have to contrast the Malolos definition of the Philippines with that contained in the 1935 and subsequent Constitutions:\\n1935 Constitution: ARTICLE I The National Territory\\nSection 1. The Philippines comprises all the territory ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris concluded between the United States and Spain on the tenth day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, the limits which are set forth in Article III of said treaty, together with all the islands embraced in the treaty concluded at Washington between the United States and Spain on the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred, and the treaty concluded between the United States and Great Britain on the second day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty, and all territory over which the present Government of the Philippine Islands exercises jurisdiction.\\n1973 Constitution: ARTICLE I The National Territory\\nSection 1. The national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all the other territories belonging to the Philippines by historic or legal title, including the territorial sea, the air space, the subsoil, the sea-bed, the insular shelves, and the submarine areas over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, irrespective of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.\\nThe present Constitution:\\nARTICLE I\\nNATIONAL TERRITORY\\nThe national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial and aerial domains, including its territorial sea, the seabed, the subsoil, the insular shelves, and other submarine areas. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.\\nAll of the above, 1935 to the present, according to the French historian, are profoundly Anglo-Saxon definitions of nationhood, defining a country according to boundaries and soil. The Malolos Constitution, on the other hand, basically defines national identity and nationhood by blood, which he says is very German and even very French. So it was that, for example, one of the first reforms prior to the extreme phase of the French revolution was to change Louis XVI’s title to King of the French from King of France. The former was leader of a collective union, the latter, sovereign of a personally-owned fiefdom. This is why, also, Louis-Philippe was named King of the French, and Napoleon III, Emperor of the French; to this day, the sovereign of Belgium is King of the Belgians.\\nSo when the framers of the 1935 Constitution in a sense, named their country, a chance Filipinos hadn’t had since 1898, they decided to view their country in the singular and not the plural: my guess is that an attempt would have been made to drop “The” even later on. In 1940, the Coat of Arms of the Commonwealth was briefly changed, the scroll underneath, for one, which had said “Commonwealth of the Philippines,” changed to simply, “Philippines.” Unfortunately the design (very similar to today’s national coat of arms) was unpopular at the time, and the old Commonwealth arms swiftly restored.\\nYou may wonder why, in Constitutional Conventions, there are Committees on Style. Lawyers who require precision of language know the importance of style, and the ability of the framers of Constitutions to be arbiters of proper (or authorized) usage is clearly shown in the decision to refer to the Philippines in the singular instead of the old plural:\\n1935 Constitution:\\nARTICLE II Declaration of Principles\\nSection 1. The Philippines, is a republican state. Sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.\\nAnyway, that is why we say “The Philippines is…” and not, “The Philippines are…”, the continuation of “the” simply being to keep the language mellifluous: simply “Philippines” would be too abrupt in spoken and written English.\\n', 41]\n",

      "[7.767320458961622e-05, \"Christianisierung[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nAls die Spanier 1565 die Philippinen als ihre Kolonie beanspruchten und es somit Neuspanien angliederten, war der Islam noch nicht tief verwurzelt, so dass es ihnen nicht schwerfiel, auch die muslimische Bevölkerung zum Christentum zu bekehren. Außerdem wurde die Christianisierung der Philippinen weitgehend friedlich durchgeführt, unter anderem wurden animistische Praktiken weitgehend geduldet, von denen einige bis heute überlebt haben. Der Buddhismus, der vermutlich neben dem Islam im 16. Jahrhundert die vorherrschende Religion auf den Philippinen war, wurde bald nur noch von der chinesischen Minderheit praktiziert.\\nAngesichts ihrer Niederlage gegen die Spanier im Jahr 1571 konvertierten die Rajahs von Manila, Rajah Sulayman , Rajah Lakandula und Rajah Matanda zum Katholizismus. Dafür durften sie einige Privilegien behalten und wurden ins koloniale Herrschaftssystem integriert. Durch die weitgehende Einbindung der einheimischen Häuptlinge in das koloniale Herrschaftssystem entstand die soziale Schicht der principialia, die als Mittelsmänner und Nutznießer des Kolonialsystems jenes über Jahrhunderte festigten.\\nDer andere wichtige Machtfaktor in der philippinischen Kolonie waren spanische Mönche und Priester. Aufgrund ihrer Rolle in der Missionierung und in den späteren Gemeinden waren sie oft die einzigen Spanier, die eine einheimische Sprache sprechen konnten. Sie lebten im Gegensatz zu den Kolonialbeamten, die nur auf Zeit im Lande waren, mehrere Jahrzehnte im Land. Sie wurden als Vermittler unverzichtbar und somit sehr mächtig.\\nIm Süden der Philippinen war der Islam zum Zeitpunkt der Ankunft der Spanier bereits tiefer verwurzelt, so dass die dortigen Moslems, von den Spaniern Moros genannt, nicht das Christentum annahmen.\\nKoloniale Wirtschaft[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nIn der frühen Kolonialzeit bildete der Galeonenhandel zwischen Manila und Acapulco die wichtigste Einnahmequelle für die Kolonie. Silber aus den Minen der neuen Welt wurde von Acapulco nach Manila verschifft und dort benutzt, um chinesische Waren wie Seide und Porzellan zu kaufen. Da bis zum 18. Jahrhundert nur die Portugiesen mit Macao das Recht hatten, die chinesische Küste direkt anzusteuern, war man auf chinesische Händler angewiesen, die sich in einem eigenen Viertel vor Manila ansiedelten, dem heutigen Binondo, wo sich auch heute die Chinatown von Manila befindet.\\nIm frühen 19. Jahrhundert änderte sich die wirtschaftliche und politische Situation. Mexiko wurde unabhängig, so dass die Philippinen nicht mehr zu Neuspanien gehörten, sondern zum ersten Mal direkt von Spanien aus verwaltet wurden. Der Galeonenhandel nach Acapulco war nicht mehr möglich und wurde 1815 eingestellt. Die Philippinen wurden nach und nach dem Welthandel geöffnet, so dass für Teile der einheimischen principalia sowie Mestizen sowohl spanischer als auch chinesischer Herkunft Wohlstand ermöglicht wurde, so dass einige ihren Kindern ein Studium, oftmals sogar in Europa, finanzieren konnten. Es entstand die Schicht der ilustrados, die durch neue, freiheitliche Ideen aus Europa beeinflusst wurden.\\nReformen und Revolution[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nJosé Rizal, Nationalheld\\nDie erste große Zäsur in der spanischen Kolonialherrschaft auf den Philippinen war die britische Invasion im Jahr 1762 , die bis 1764 andauern sollte. In deren Folge entwickelten sich Aufstände in der Ilocos-Region und Pangasinan. Diego Silang führte einen Aufstand an und es gelang ihm 1763 die bedeutende Stadt Vigan einzunehmen. Er verbündete sich mit den Briten, doch hielten sich diese nicht an ihre Zusagen, so dass er am 28. Mai 1763 ermordet wurde. Seine Frau Gabriela führte den Aufstand fort, wurde jedoch im September verhaftet und ermordet, was als Hinrichtung dargestellt wurde. Im Jahr 1762 brach in der Provinz Pangasinán der Palaris-Aufstand aus, der zunächst ebenfalls erfolgreich war und erst 1765 niedergeschlagen werden konnte. [48] In der Folge dieser Ereignisse wurde vielen Filipinos klar, dass die spanische Oberhoheit nicht ewig dauern könne.\\nVon besonderer Bedeutung für die Philippinen war die Säkularisierungsbewegung innerhalb der katholischen Kirche, die von Pedro Pelaez in den 1850er Jahren begründet wurde. Die Bewegung forderte die Philippinisierung der Kirche und eine Beschränkung der Macht der spanischen Ordensgemeinschaften. Die Bewegung war von liberalen Ideen geprägt, die die Gleichberechtigung von Filipinos und Spaniern forderte. [49]\\n1868 fand in Spanien eine Revolution statt, so dass der liberale Gouverneur Carlos Maria dela Torre auf die Philippinen geschickt wurde, der liberale Reformen durchführte und unter anderem die Pressezensur abschaffte. 1871 war diese Phase jedoch vorbei. Insbesondere die spanischen Mönchsorden auf den Philippinen entfalteten wieder ihre Macht. Am 20. Januar 1872 brach im Fort San Felipe die Cavite-Meuterei aus, die jedoch schnell niedergeschlagen wurde. In der Folge der Meuterei wurden jedoch die Priester Mariano Gómez, José Burgos und Jacinto Zamora inhaftiert. Die spanischen Kolonialbehörden nutzten das Ereignis, um sich unliebsamer Zeitgenossen, die für ihre fortschrittlichen Ideen bekannt waren, zu entledigen. Drei Priester wurden am 17. Februar 1872 hingerichtet, was einen Aufschrei des Entsetzens in der Bevölkerung auslöste und zur Bewegung der Ilustrados führte. Die drei Priester sind bis heute als GOMBURZA ein Begriff im Gedächtnis der Filipinos.\\nIm letzten Viertel des 19. Jahrhunderts wurden die Rufe der Ilustrados nach Reformen immer lauter. Die Bezeichnung Filipino, die früher nur für spanische Kreolen benutzt wurde, wurde auf alle Einwohner des Landes ausgeweitet. Die Propagandabewegung, die aus Europa von philippinischen Studenten und Exilanten betrieben wurde, sowie die kurzlebige La Liga Filipina , die kurz nach ihrer Gründung durch José Rizal in Manila sofort von den dortigen Behörden verboten wurde, hatten zunächst nicht die Unabhängigkeit der Philippinen zum Ziel, sondern Gleichberechtigung der Filipinos und philippinische Sitze in den spanischen Cortes . Doch für einige ging dies nicht weit genug.\\nVon 1896 bis 1898 fand unter der Führung des Katipunan die Philippinische Revolution statt, die in ihrer Endphase praktisch in den Spanisch-Amerikanischen Krieg überging. Im Verlauf der Revolution wurde im Juli 1897 die erste provisorische Republik ausgerufen, die Republik von Biak-na-Bato , und am 1. November die erste provisorische Verfassung der Philippinen verabschiedet, die am 15. November in Kraft trat. Die Republik wurde jedoch am 15. Dezember 1897 wieder aufgelöst mit der Unterzeichnung des Vertrages von Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel zwischen der philippinischen und der spanischen Partei. [50]\\nBereits zu Beginn dieser Auseinandersetzung zwischen Spanien und den Vereinigten Staaten wurde die spanische Flotte durch amerikanische Schiffe in der Schlacht in der Bucht von Manila vernichtet. Ein Großteil des Landes war jedoch zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits unter philippinischer Kontrolle, worauf am 12. Juni 1898 die philippinische Unabhängigkeitserklärung erfolgte, welche weder von der alten noch der neuen Kolonialmacht anerkannt und vom Rest der Welt gar nicht erst wahrgenommen wurde. 1899 folgte die Konstitution der ersten philippinischen Republik .\\nAmerikanische Kolonialzeit[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nDie USA erkannten die junge philippinische Republik nicht an und bekämpften sie im Philippinisch-Amerikanischen Krieg von 1899 bis 1902 massiv. Etwa eine Million Filipinos (20\\xa0% der Gesamtbevölkerung) kamen während dieser Zeit ums Leben, und das Land wurde zur amerikanischen Kolonie. [51] Unterstützung erhielten die Revolutionäre lediglich vom Hongkong-Komitee , das internationale Verbindungen knüpfte und für die materielle Unterstützung der Filipinos sorgte. [52]\\nBereits am 20. Januar 1900 wurde die Schurman-Kommission von US-Präsident William McKinley berufen. Sie sollte Vorschläge für einen Übergang zu einer zivilen Kolonialverwaltung ausarbeiten, diese Ergebnisse wurden im Januar 1901 vorgelegt. [53] Im März 1901 wurde daraufhin der spätere US-Präsident William Howard Taft zum Vorsitzenden der nach ihm benannten Taft-Kommission berufen und auf die Philippinen entsandt, um eine zivile Kolonialverwaltung zu etablieren. Er baute den Obersten Gerichtshof der Philippinen auf, zu dessen erstem Vorsitzenden Cayetano Arellano 1901 berufen wurde, und es wurde ein öffentliches Bildungswesen etabliert. [54] Es wurden auch Vorbereitungen getroffen, um eine Zweikammer-Legislative zu schaffen. Die Taft-Kommission bildete nach Vorbild des US-Systems das Oberhaus und die Philippinische Versammlung das Unterhaus, erste Wahlen zu Letzterer wurden am 30. Juni 1907 durchgeführt und am 16. Oktober Manila Grand Opera House konstituiert. [55]\\n1904 wurde im Süden der Philippinen, der von den Spaniern nie ganz unterworfen worden war, von den Amerikanern die Moro Province gegründet und militärisch kontrolliert. Dadurch kam es zum Moro-Amerikanischen Krieg , der von 1904 bis 1913/16 andauerte und durch den US-General John Pershing beendet wurde. So wurde aus der in spanischer Zeit eher formellen Zugehörigkeit der Moslemgebiete zu den Philippinen eine faktische. Auf der Insel Mindanao wurden große Monokulturen amerikanischer Konzerne angelegt, wie zum Beispiel Ananasplantagen. Es kam in den 1920er und 1950er Jahren außerdem zu staatlich geförderten Siedlungsprogrammen, bei denen Christen aus dem Norden und aus der Mitte der Philippinen in den Süden gebracht wurden. Der heutige Konflikt im Süden der Philippinen hat seine Wurzeln in dieser Zeit.\\nMit Inkrafttreten des Philippine Autonomy Acts 1916 wurde den Filipinos mehr Aufgaben übertragen, dazu löste die Philippinische Legislative das bisherige Parlamentssystem ab, so dass man ab diesem Zeitpunkt von einem halbautonomen Status der Philippinen sprechen kann. In diesem Zweikammersystem waren nunmehr nur noch Filipinos vertreten. [56]\\n1935 wurde eine Teilautonomie für die Philippinen mit dem Ziel der Unabhängigkeit bis 1945 beschlossen. Kurz darauf wurde die Einwanderung von Filipinos in die USA erheblich eingeschränkt. Manuel Quezon wurde Präsident des Commonwealth der Philippinen . Das Parlament wurde auf ein Einkammersystem reduziert, die Nationalversammlung. 1940 verständigte man sich wieder auf ein Zweikammersystem und der Commonwealth Kongress entstand. 1937 wurde das Frauenwahlrecht durchgesetzt und von diesem Zeitpunkt an konnten sich Frauen auch für politische Ämter bewerben. [57] Quezon holte sich später Douglas MacArthur als Militärberater hinzu, der beim Aufbau eigener philippinischer Streitkräfte half. 1941/42 kämpften philippinische und amerikanische Soldaten vergeblich gegen die eindringende japanische Armee (→ Schlacht um die Philippinen ). Am 8. Mai 1942 kapitulierten die letzten philippinischen und amerikanischen Einheiten.\\nVon 1942 bis 1945 wurden die Philippinen im Zuge des Zweiten Weltkriegs von Japan besetzt. Etwa 1 Million Filipinos starben durch das brutale Besatzungsregime der japanischen Armee, etliche Städte wurden in Schutt und Asche gelegt.\\nAm 4. Juli 1946 wurden die Philippinen offiziell in die Unabhängigkeit entlassen. Die USA behielten einige Jahrzehnte lang wirtschaftliche Sonderrechte und militärische Stützpunkte auf den Philippinen und spielen bis heute eine wichtige Rolle in der philippinischen Politik.\\nMediendatei abspielen\\nFilmaufnahmen der Unabhängigkeitserklärung (englisch)\\nNach der Unabhängigkeit galt zunächst einmal die Verfassung von 1935 weiter, in der die Philippinen eine Präsidialrepublik nach amerikanischem Muster waren. Der Einfluss der USA blieb weiterhin sehr groß, unter anderem ließen sich die USA am 14. März 1947 für die Dauer von 99 Jahren die Hoheitsrechte über 23 Militärstützpunkte garantieren. Die Philippinen entsandten wiederum 1951 fünf Bataillone in den Koreakrieg , um den USA zu helfen.\\nGegen Aufstände durch die kommunistischen Hukbalahap , einer ehemaligen Widerstandsbewegung gegen die japanische Besatzung, gab es von den USA Ausrüstung und amerikanische Militärberater, unter anderem der CIA-Agent Edward Lansdale , der später in Vietnam eine wichtige Rolle spielen sollte. Um den Aufstand zu entschärfen, wurde in den 1950er Jahren die Umsiedlung armer Bauern in den Süden der Philippinen verstärkt gefördert.\\nIm Jahr 1963 kam es zu einem Konflikt mit Malaysia , da die Philippinen Sabah als früheren Bestandteil des Sultanats von Sulu beanspruchten. Diese Problematik ist bis heute offen. So verordnete die philippinische Präsidentin Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, dass Sabah nicht als Teil Malaysias anerkannt wird, 2013 erinnerte das philippinische Außenministerium an die Verordnung. [58]\\nAufgrund von Konflikten zwischen christlichen Siedlern und muslimischen Einheimischen kam es in den 1960er Jahren immer mehr zu Konflikten im Süden der Philippinen. 1968 wurden einige muslimische Armee-Rekruten erschossen, die sich weigerten, an einer Geheimoperation zur Rückeroberung Sabahs teilzunehmen. Als Reaktion auf dieses Massaker bildeten sich die ersten separatistischen Bewegungen auf den Südphilippinen.\\nIm Jahr 1965 wurde der populäre junge Politiker Ferdinand E. Marcos zum Präsidenten gewählt. 1971 wurde Marcos als erster Präsident der Philippinen wiedergewählt, wobei die Wahl als solche sehr umstritten war. Im selben Jahr ließ Marcos eine verfassungsgebende Versammlung einberufen, um die veraltete Verfassung von 1935 zu ersetzen. Gegner von Marcos verdächtigten ihn deshalb des Versuches, die Beschränkung auf zwei Wahlperioden umgehen zu wollen. Ab 1970 hatte es Marcos außerdem sowohl mit dem First Quarter Storm zu tun, einer linken Studentenbewegung, die unter anderem seine Amtsführung, den pro-amerikanischen Kurs geißelte, als auch mit einer neuen maoistischen kommunistischen Guerilla, der New People's Army (NPA) und der Alex Boncayao-Brigade (ABB).\\nMarcos-Diktatur[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nFerdinand Marcos\\nIm Jahr 1972 gab es eine Serie von Bombenanschlägen, von denen man heute vermutet, dass sie von Militärs durchgeführt wurden, um Marcos einen Vorwand für das Kriegsrecht zu liefern. Am 21. September 1972 erklärte Marcos das Kriegsrecht, ließ Oppositionszeitungen und -sender schließen und veranlasste die Inhaftierung zahlreicher Oppositioneller. 1973 ließ er eine neue parlamentarische Verfassung ratifizieren. Das Kriegsrecht wurde zwar 1980 aufgehoben und es kam 1981 sogar zu einer Parlamentswahl, bei der aber massive Wahlfälschung vermutet wurde.\\nWährend der Marcos-Diktatur kam es zu massiven Repressalien gegen Oppositionelle. Manche wurden jahrelang in Untersuchungshaft gehalten, unter anderem der prominente Marcos-Rivale Benigno Aquino, Jr. Im Zuge der Bekämpfung der NPA kam es in manchen Provinzen zu Repressalien gegen die Landbevölkerung. Etliche Oppositionelle oder vermutete Kommunisten verschwanden entweder spurlos oder wurden schwer verstümmelt aufgefunden, eine Praxis, die vom Militär „salvaging“ genannt wurde. Unterdessen bereicherten sich Marcos, seine Frau Imelda und seine Freunde, während die Auslandsschulden der Philippinen immer weiter stiegen. Es wurde viel Geld für Prestigeprojekte ausgegeben, unter anderem für eine Herzklinik und einen Filmpalast.\\nCorazon Aquino (1992)\\nAm 21. August 1983 wurde der Oppositionsführer Benigno Aquino bei dem Versuch, das Land am Flughafen von Manila zu betreten, ermordet. Daraufhin entwickelte sich eine breite Oppositionsbewegung gegen Marcos, der dieser mit vorgezogenen Neuwahlen zu begegnen versuchte. Nach der gefälschten vorgezogenen Präsidentschaftswahl vom Februar 1986 demonstrierten mehr als eine Million Filipinos auf der EDSA-Avenue in Manila und forderten Marcos Rücktritt. Die katholische Kirche unterstützte die Demonstranten, woraufhin die Demonstrationen sich über das gesamte Land ausweiteten und als EDSA-Revolution in die Geschichte eingingen. Durch die Weigerung des Militärs, die Demonstration gewaltsam aufzulösen, sah sich Marcos am 25. Februar 1986 gezwungen, in das US-amerikanische Hawaii zu fliehen. Die Witwe des ermordeten Benigno Aquino und Oppositionsführerin, Corazon Aquino , wurde am selben Tag als die neue Präsidentin vereidigt. [59]\\nPolitik[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nAm 11. Februar 1987 trat eine neue Verfassung in Kraft und seit 1987 sind die Philippinen wieder eine Präsidialrepublik . Der Präsident hat weitreichende exekutive Befugnisse. Er beruft das Kabinett ein. Der Kongress besteht aus Repräsentantenhaus und Senat . Es besteht de jure Wahlpflicht .\\nVom 20. Januar 2001 bis zum 30. Juni 2010 war Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (*\\xa01947) Staatsoberhaupt (zuvor Vizepräsidentin); sie wurde am 30. Juni 2004 trotz verschiedener Vorwürfe massiver Wahlfälschungen, die in der Folgezeit noch bestätigt wurden (Tonbandmitschnitt der Fälschungsvereinbarungen, im weiteren Verlauf auch präzise Aussagen von reuigen Mitgliedern der Wahlkommission) erneut vereidigt. Am 18. November 2011 wurde gegen sie ein Haftbefehl erlassen. Ihr wurde vorgeworfen, die Ergebnisse der Senatswahl 2007 manipuliert zu haben. Macapagal Arroyo ist Nachfolgerin von Joseph E. Estrada , der nach Verlust seiner Machtbasis als Folge von Korruptionsvorwürfen und des Drucks von Demonstrationen seinen Amtssitz vorzeitig verlassen hatte. Die erst 2006 durchgeführten Vernehmungen entlasteten ihn jedoch weitgehend und wiesen vielmehr auf einen engen Vertrauten Arroyos, Chavit Singson, Gouverneur von Ilocos Sur, der für seine Geschäfte im Bereich des illegalen Glücksspiels schon bekannt war. Nach einer Verurteilung durch ein von ihm nicht anerkanntes Sondergericht („Sandiganbayan“) gewährte ihm Arroyo ein „bedingungsloses Pardon“. [60]\\nEine sinnvolle Politik war deshalb zwischenzeitlich kaum möglich. Die Regierung musste sich ständig gegen neue Beweise ihrer Illegitimität wehren. Gleichzeitig war sie mit der Abwehr vermeintlicher oder tatsächlicher Putschversuche beschäftigt. Um beispielsweise eine öffentliche Ansprache an das Volk in Manila (SONA) zu halten, benötigte die Präsidentin 2006 etwa 13.000 Polizisten/Soldaten.\\nAm 10. Mai 2010 wurden Wahlen (u.\\xa0a. für das Präsidentenamt) auf den Philippinen durchgeführt. Dabei wurde in hohem Maß auf Computertechnik zurückgegriffen, um keinen Zweifel an den Ergebnissen der Wahl zuzulassen. Gleichwohl wurde die Bekanntgabe des endgültigen amtlichen Endergebnisses auch dieses Mal durch Vorwürfe der Wahlmanipulation überschattet. Techniker der beteiligten Firma haben die einfachen Eingriffsmöglichkeiten an den Wahlcomputern detailliert dargelegt. [61] Am 30. Juni 2010 wurde Benigno Aquino III. als Präsident vereidigt. [62]\\nDie philippinische Politik ist sehr personenbezogen, so dass Parteien keine so große Rolle spielen. Viele philippinische Politiker gehören einer politischen Dynastie an: So ist zum Beispiel Macapagal-Arroyo die Tochter des ehemaligen Präsidenten Diosdado Macapagal oder der Sohn von Ferdinand Marcos, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. , auch Bong-Bong genannt, Gouverneur der Heimatprovinz seines Vaters, Ilocos Norte , und der Sohn des ehemaligen Präsidenten Ramon Magsaysay , Ramon Magsaysay jr. , ist Senator. Popularität und regionale Zugehörigkeitsgefühle zählen oft viel mehr als Sachthemen. In den letzten Jahren sind viele Schauspieler, ehemalige Basketballstars und ähnliche Medienpersönlichkeiten in die Politik gegangen.\\nDie Philippinen sind Mitglied im Sicherheitsrat der UN , ASEAN , APEC und der Lateinischen Union .\\n2006 wurden die Philippinen für ein Jahr in den UN-Menschenrechtsrat (engl. Council on Human Rights) aufgenommen. Eine Wiederwahl ist möglich, allerdings auch eine Abwahl wegen massiver Menschenrechtsverletzungen im eigenen Land. Der im Dezember 2006 in Cebu geplante ASEAN-Gipfel wurde kurzfristig angeblich wegen des Wetters abgesagt. Von der Opposition wurde jedoch auch die Angst vor Massenprotesten gegen Versuche, die Verfassung ohne entsprechende Verfahren zu ändern, angeführt. Anfang 2007 informierte sich der UN-Beauftragte Philip Alston über die umstrittene Menschenrechtslage. Nach anfänglichem Widerstand erhielt er den unveröffentlichten vorläufigen Bericht der so genannten „Melo-Kommission“. Hier wird zum ersten Mal auch von offizieller Seite die Verwicklung des Militärs, besonders des Generals Palparan, in die politischen Morde an Linken belegt.\\nDemokratiesituation[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nSeit dem Ende der Marcosdiktatur hat es immer wieder politische Unruhen auf den Philippinen gegeben, so dass keineswegs von einer stabilen Demokratie die Rede sein kann. Im August 1987 und Dezember 1989 gab es Putschversuche des Oberst Gregorio „Gringo“ Honasan . Im Jahr 2003 kam es zu einer Meuterei von Marinesoldaten unter Leutnant Antonio Trillanes, bei der ein Hotel besetzt wurde. Die Soldaten gaben jedoch friedlich auf und wurden vor ein Militärgericht gestellt. Im Jahr 2006 gab es einen angeblichen Putschversuch, der zur Ausrufung eines Notstandes durch Präsidentin Arroyo und zu einigen Verhaftungen führte (siehe Artikel Putschversuch auf den Philippinen 2006 ).\\nSowohl Arroyo als auch Aquino kamen jeweils 2001 und 1986 aufgrund von Demonstrationen und durch Überlaufen führender Militärs an die Macht, so dass formal gesehen die Rechtsstaatlichkeit verletzt wurde. Im Jahr 2001 kam es zu Demonstrationen und zu Krawallen von Estrada-Anhängern, die die neue Präsidentin durch Militär niederschlagen ließ. Es gab Tote und Verletzte. Bis heute ist die politische Situation sehr stark polarisiert. Die offensichtlich gefälschten Wahlen von 2004 und in der Folge zahlreiche politisch motivierte Morde an „Linken“, aber auch Menschenrechtsaktivisten und Ähnliches haben die Situation zusätzlich erschwert.\\nDie Wahlen 2007 brachten trotz massiver Einschüchterungs- und Fälschungsversuche einen Erdrutschsieg für die Opposition. Der wegen des Putschversuchs immer noch inhaftierte Trillanes gewann ohne jeden Wahlkampf einen Senatssitz.\\nAm 29. November 2007 gelang es den Verantwortlichen des Putschversuches von 2003, während einer Anhörung das Gerichtsgebäude von Manila zu verlassen und sich nach einem Marsch durch die Innenstadt von Makati in einem Hotel zu verschanzen. Angeführt wurde die Gruppe von Antonio Trillanes und dem Brigadegeneral Danilo Lim. Ein Aufruf an Soldaten, sich ihnen anzuschließen, blieb aber ohne Wirkung, und die Putschisten ergaben sich schließlich den Sicherheitskräften, als diese drohten, das Hotel zu stürmen. [63]\\nAm 23. November 2009 kam es in der Provinz Maguindanao zu einem Massaker an Zivilisten, bei dem 57 Menschen ermordet wurden. Das Massaker stand im Zusammenhang mit den Wahlen vom 10. Mai 2010. Der Hauptverdächtige aus dem Ampatuanclan hatte angeblich für die damalige Präsidentin Macapagal Arroyo in den Jahren 2004 (Präsidentschaftswahlen) und 2007 (Senatswahlen, Zubiri) die Wahlen massiv gefälscht bzw. fälschen lassen. Die Opposition bekam jeweils 0 Stimmen.\\nDer frühere Botschafter der Philippinen in den USA, Ernesto Maceda, verweist in einem Beitrag der oppositionellen Zeitung „The Daily Tribune“ vom 11. Dezember 2009 [64] [65] darauf, dass schon zuvor 200 Morde und andere Gräueltaten von den Ampatuans in der Gegend verübt wurden, ohne bisher juristische Konsequenzen zu haben.\\nDer Regierung Arroyo wurde 2006 vorgeworfen, über 800 politisch motivierte Morde nicht aufgeklärt zu haben. [66]\\nDie Folge dieser politischen Situation war, dass in den Präsidentschaftswahlen von 2016 der Kandidat der Partei PLP, Rodrigo Duterte , eine Mehrheit erhielt. Er hatte in erster Linie mit einer drakonischen Verfolgung und Bestrafung der Drogenkriminalität geworben.\\nMinderheitenkonflikte[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nVor der Ankunft der Spanier bestanden die Philippinen aus Barangays (Gemeinden) verschiedener Völker und Stämme, die vielfältig untereinander vernetzt waren. Spanien kolonisierte den größten Teil des Archipels und in 300 Jahren entstand eine Philippinische Mehrheitsidentität. In einigen Gebieten, wie in den Philippinischen Kordilleren mit den Stämmen der Igorot im Norden und den Gebieten der Moro und Lumad im Süden, wurden die Menschen kaum beeinflusst.\\nDie spanische Kolonialzeit prägte die unter ihrer Kontrolle stehenden Menschen: die erlittene Ausbeutung, das feudale Wirtschaftssystem, später das halbfeudale Hazienda-System, die zentralisierte Regierung, die christlichen und spanischen Einflüsse. Und sie schaffte die Minderheiten: die Menschen, die an der Peripherie der wirtschaftlichen, kulturellen und politischen Veränderungen lebten und ihre indigenen Traditionen bewahrten. [67]\\nTerror und Konflikt[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nVor allem im Süden Mindanaos kommt es immer wieder zu bewaffneten Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Rebellen der separatistischen MNLF ( Nationale Befreiungsfront der Moros ), der islamistischen MILF ( Islamische Befreiungsfront der Moros ) und Regierungstruppen. Die MNLF regiert heute die Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (deutsch: autonome Region im muslimischen Mindanao), während die islamistische MILF sich weiter für einen eigenständigen Moslem-Staat einsetzt, der aus den Inseln Mindanao, Palawan , Basilan und dem Sulu-Archipel bestehen soll. Die Abu Sayyaf sind wiederum eine terroristische Gruppe, die durch Entführungen und Anschläge bekannt wurde.\\nIm Zuge dieser Auseinandersetzungen kommt es auch immer wieder zu terroristischen Angriffen, wie etwa den Bombenanschlägen auf den internationalen Flughafen in Davao City im Frühjahr 2003 sowie auf ein Hafenterminal in Davao etwa zur selben Zeit. Beide Anschläge forderten mehrere Todesopfer. Des Weiteren kommt es immer wieder zu religiös begründeten Anschlägen auf christliche Kirchen. Aufgrund dieser Gefährdungssituation wurden unter anderem vom deutschen Auswärtigen Amt in der Vergangenheit mehrmals Reisewarnungen für die Philippinen herausgegeben und es wurde insbesondere von Reisen nach Mindanao abgeraten.\\nEs handelt sich nur oberflächlich betrachtet um einen reinen Religionskonflikt. Eine andere der zugrunde liegenden Ursachen ist beispielsweise das von den Vereinigten Staaten durchgesetzte Landgesetz von 1903, das Christen gestattete, bis zu 23\\xa0ha Land zu besitzen, während der Landbesitz für die muslimische und nichtchristliche Bevölkerung auf 10\\xa0ha begrenzt war. Dieses Gesetz bildete nur einen Baustein einer andauernden systematischen Enteignungskampagne. In den 1950er Jahren wurde die systematische Einwanderung christlicher Siedler nach Mindanao durch die philippinische Zentralregierung in Manila gefördert. Die muslimischen Einwohner wurden damit in ihren angestammten Gebieten zur Minderheit.\\nDiese Faktoren führten letztlich zu einem der größten vergessenen Kriege unserer Zeit: Der Bürgerkrieg auf Mindanao forderte von den 1970er Jahren bis 2002 nach Angaben der Weltbank mindestens 120.000 Opfer, die Mehrzahl von ihnen Zivilisten. Zahlreiche Versuche zu ernsthaften Friedensabschlüssen zu gelangen scheiterten bisher, unter anderem an einer fehlenden langfristigen Perspektive für die Region, die einen fairen Interessenausgleich aller Beteiligten und Betroffenen bietet.\\nAm 27. März 2014 unterzeichneten die philippinische Regierung und die islamische Befreiungsfront der Moros (MILF) das Friedensabkommen zur Schaffung der politisch selbständigen Region Bangsamoro im Süden der Philippinen. [68]\\nEnde Mai 2017 verhängte Präsident Duterte das Kriegsrecht über Mindanao, nachdem in der Stadt Marawi etwa 100 islamistische Rebellen Angriffe durchgeführt hatten. [69] (Siehe hierzu auch: Schlacht um Maute 2017 ). Dieser Konflikt führte zu einem stärkeren Engagement Chinas, das der Regierung Duterte im Sommer 2017 Militärhilfe im Wert von mehreren Millionen Dollar zukommen liess. [70]\\nMenschenrechte[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nSeit Ende der 1960er Jahre schwelt in den Philippinen ein bewaffneter Konflikt zwischen muslimischen Guerillatruppen (insbesondere MILF , MNLF , Abu Sayyaf ), linksgerichteten Guerillatruppen (insbesondere New People's Army (NPA)), Paramilitärs insbesondere den legalen Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) und der regulären philippinischen Armee.

Unter der Präsidentin Macapagal-Arroyo (2001 bis 2010) verschlechterte sich die Situation erheblich und erreichte das Niveau der überwundenen Diktaturzeit. Insbesondere erreichte die Anzahl von außergerichtlichen Hinrichtungen und dem erzwungenen Verschwindenlassen einen Negativrekord, dazu kommt die übliche Folterpraxis von Regierungsgegnern. Während ihrer Amtszeit dokumentierte die philippinische Menschenrechtsorganisation Karapatan 1.206 Fälle politischer Morde, 206 weitere Personen wurden Opfer von erzwungenem Verschwindenlassen.

Dozens of trucks, bearing the logo of a local contractor, lined up at the mine site to cart the stolen nickel ore away.\\n\"The brazenness is incredible,\" Rusina Mining\\'s managing director, Robert Gregory,  said.\\nBy mid-April, more nickel ore had been removed from the property by the illegal miners than Rusina\\'s own operations. Gregory estimates that 50,000 tons of ore, valued at about $4.5 million, had been taken by his unlawful competition.\\nThree other miners, with concessions adjacent to Rusina\\'s in Zambales Province, 250 kilometers, or 150 miles,  north of Manila, had experienced the same fate. Nine container ships had already sailed from the nearby port of Santa Cruz with an estimated 450,000 tons of ore. Another 200,000 tons was waiting on the dock.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nA 2005 decision by the Philippine Supreme Court to uphold the constitutional validity of a law allowing 100 percent foreign ownership of mines should have opened the floodgates of investment.\\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision, the administration of the President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo identified mining as one of the key drivers of future economic growth.  It estimates that  as much as $9 billion in new investment could flow into the industry by 2011.\\nBut miners and mining analysts say the money is still only trickling in to exploration and the opening of new mines. Excessive and slow regulatory procedures, laws that give local governments significant power over the exploitation of mineral resources, the invasion of mining concessions by illegal miners or small-scale mining operators,  and security problems surrounding many mines in remote regions are all blamed for discouraging investment.\\nThe Fraser Institute, one of the leading international mining research groups, ranks the Philippines as one of the five most mineral-rich countries in the world, but, in an annual survey, places it near the bottom of the 65 mining regions and countries as an investment destination, only slightly better than Zimbabwe.\\nThe Philippines government estimates mineral wealth of $1 trillion. It is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa, and one of the largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite and zinc.\\n\"Philippine resources are among the best in the world,  so miners have to take an interest,\" said Peter Wallace, a Manila-based business consultant, who has written extensively on the country\\'s mining industry.\\n\"But there are other places for miners to put their money, so they don\\'t have to come here,\" he said. \"What we are seeing is small miners come in, take the exploration risk  and then try to sell on to the majors. But we have not had a lot of investment from the majors yet.\"\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nSome major companies, like BHP Billiton and Anglo-American, have carried out exploration, but have been wary about committing to new projects.\\nThe president of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, Benjamin Philip Romualdez,  said that the legal impediments to foreign investment had been resolved, and that  all that remained was for \"companies to work through the process under the mining law to push their investments through to commercial operation.\"\\nMining in the Philippines also suffers a significant domestic image problem.  Mining  in the past has caused serious environmental damage, antagonizing local communities and powerful interest groups, like the Catholic Church, to which 85 percent of Filipinos belong.\\nThe worst environmental disaster occurred in 1996,  when an earthquake caused a drainage tunnel to collapse at a copper mine on Marinduque Island, contaminating a river. A United Nations assessment mission described the situation as an \"environmental disaster.\"\\nThe owner, Marcopper Mining, was a joint venture between Placer Dome, of Canada, and a Filipino businessman. In an attempted rehabilitation, Placer Dome paid $70 million in compensation to affected villagers. The Boac River was considered biologically dead soon after the spillage.\\nThis incident and others hardened attitudes among environmentalists and communities against multinational miners. The Marcopper disaster was followed by a legal challenge to a 1995 mining law that allowed foreign interests to wholly own a mining operation. The effect was to halt almost all new foreign investment in the industry for a decade.\\nNewsletter Sign Up\\nPlease verify you\\'re not a robot by clicking the box.\\nInvalid email address.

Arroyo set up a high-powered committee,  the Mineral Development Council,  to help coordinate policy and respond to the industry\\'s needs.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nMiners say they are particularly concerned by the slow pace at which the government issues mining permits, the lack of coordination between local governments and the national  government and an often poor security situation around mine sites.\\nBut in an interview, Arroyo said the miners  have to do more to ensure they win over the communities in which they operate. She said environmental and community relations problems surrounding some mining projects in the past \"contributes to the skepticism\" of many Filipinos toward mining.\\n\"I want to cut down on red tape, including in the mining bureaucracy, but having said that,  I also want to make sure that we are able to ferret out the responsible miners from the fly-by-nighters,\" Arroyo said.\\n\"It\\'s really very important that we make sure that the mining investor works not only for the company but also for the community,\"  she said.\\nBig miners say it is local communities that have been losing out from the way mining has been managed in the past. A 1991 Small-Scale Mining Act allows provincial governments to issue permits to almost anyone who can afford a pick and a shovel. The small operators in theory sell ore to contractors to ship or refine.\\nBut in practice a lot of small miners are backed by highly organized syndicates. They have used locally issued permits to invade concessions owned by other miners, failed to effectively exploit the mineral wealth of an area, caused environmental damage without cleaning up and paid few taxes back to the communities, analysts and foreign miners say.\\nSome areas, like the Diwalwal gold field on the southern island of Mindanao, have become gun-totting no-go zones.\\n\"Even the police won\\'t go there,\" said Gregory, the Rusina manager. \"Millions of ounces are squandered, recoveries are way down. Money is not spent on communities and pollution and rehabilitation are a problem.\"\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nConcerns over lawlessness have been aggravated because of threats against miners by communist and Islamic insurgents. This year, insurgents with the communist New People\\'s Army threatened to attack foreign mines and  then launched several small raids.\\nThe Canadian miner TVI Resource Development was on the sharp end of that problem in 2002 when 15 local people were killed on their way to a market when two vehicles owned by the miner were ambushed by Islamic insurgents.\\nTVI, which operates a mine near Zamboanga,  in Mindanao,  that has deposits of gold, sliver, copper and zinc, was itself subject to criticism for heavy-handed security and alleged human rights abuses by guards.\\nJohn Risdel, the company\\'s managing director, said a legacy of hostility has been reversed by intense efforts at consultation to win over the local community and the dearming of most of its guard force. It will still rely on the military for some protection, but depends more on the good will of local people to provide information and prevent attacks on the mine.\\nTo help rebut criticism of the human rights record, Risdel hired the former deputy head of Amnesty International in the Philippines as a community relations adviser.\\n\"We have learned so much about the culture and the people of Zamboanga,\" he said. \"We are working with the people and gaining the social license to operate.\"\\nA version of this article appears in print on May 14, 2008, in The International Herald Tribune.

ERIK DE CASTROREUTERS\\nTwitter\\n@iaranau\\n09/05/2016 20:59\\nRodrigo Duterte , el controvertido político de 71 años que ha prometido acabar con la inseguridad y la corrupción en Filipinas, se ha alzado este lunes con la Presidencia del país al conseguir casi el 40% de los votos emitidos, con una ciudadanía que ha optado por un líder visto como fuerte pese al riesgo que su elección implica para los derechos humanos y las libertades civiles.\\nEl que fuera durante 22 años alcalde de Davao, la tercera ciudad de país, se ha convertido en el 16º presidente de esta pujante nación asiática de 100 millones de habitantes, imponiéndose con holgura en una jornada precedida por una campaña pródiga en salidas de tono y acusaciones de todo tipo. El propio Duterte fue protagonista de varios de estos episodios, como cuando se burló de la violación y muerte de una misionera en un motín carcelario, llamó \"hijo de puta\" al Papa en una de las naciones más católicas del planeta o alardeó de su animada vida sexual y su afición por tomar viagra.\\nA falta de contabilizar el 15% de votos, la Comisión Electoral de Filipinas ha informado de que Duterte había conseguido 14,2 millones de votos, un 38,6% del total. En segundo lugar se sitúa Manuel Roxas con el 23%, mientras que la tercera posición es para la senadora Grace Poe, que obtiene el 21%. Además, los 55 millones de electores han decidido este lunes la suerte de otros 18.000 cargos públicos.\\nApodado \\'Duterte el sucio\\', \\'el castigador\\' o \\'el Donald Trump filipino\\', sus detractores han avisado de que su estilo autoritario corre el riesgo de hacer que el país vuelva a convertirse en una dictadura como las sufridas en el pasado. De hecho, el propio Duterte amenazó durante la campaña con disolver el Congreso e imponer un \"Gobierno revolucionario\" si sus reformas encuentran resistencia. \"¿Si soy un dictador? Sí, es cierto\", aseguró en respuesta a las acusaciones de la oposición en uno de sus actos.\\nPero, a pesar de las críticas y las acusaciones, este hombre ha sido capaz de encandilar, con su estilo marrullero y sus promesas de justicia y de reparto de riqueza, a una población harta de ver cómo el espectacular crecimiento que desde hace años vive la economía del archipiélago no se traduce en mejoras tangibles en su vida diaria.\\nEn Filipinas, 40 familias controlan el 76% de la fortuna nacional, y unas docenas de dinastías politicoeconómicas manejan las riendas del Estado desde hace generaciones. Frente a esta oligarquía, Duterte se presentó como un hombre sencillo independiente de la élite gobernante lo que, sumado a sus promesas de mano dura contra el crimen que azota el país, lo auparon hace semanas a lo más alto de las encuestas.\\nDuterte se ha comprometido a terminar con la criminalidad en seis meses, aunque para ello tenga que ejecutar a unos 100.000 delincuentes. No en vano, en sus años como alcalde, al ahora presidente se le relacionó con los escuadrones de la muerte que acabaron a tiro limpio con camellos y violadores de la sureña Davao y convirtieron la ciudad más peligrosa del país en la más segura de todas. \"Olvidaos de las leyes de derechos humanos\" declaró al cierre de su campaña.\"Si llego al palacio presidencial, haré como hice de alcalde. Traficantes, ladrones y maleantes, haríais mejor en iros\" aseguró farruco.\\nSu estilo encaja con una campaña en la que la violencia ha jugado un papel muy destacado, algo por otra parte típico en Filipinas. Durante los meses previos, hasta 15 personas fueron asesinadas en relación con el proceso electoral, y este lunes otras 10 han perdido la vida en diferentes incidentes.\\nAdemás de las deficiencias en las infraestructuras o la arraigada corrupción, Duterte también deberá tomar las riendas del proceso de paz en el conflicto que padece el Sur, mayoritariamente musulmán, desde hace lustros, en el que han muerto unas 150.000 personas en la lucha entre guerrilleros y ejército; o las disputas territoriales que mantiene con la vecina China , cuyas reclamaciones de soberanía en el Mar de China Meridional chocan con las pretensiones filipinas.\\nEn la apretada carrera por hacerse con la Vicepresidencia, Ferdinand \\'Bongbong\\' Marcos Jr., hijo del antiguo dictador y s u esposa Imelda , aventaja en tan sólo 0,2% puntos a Maria Leonor Robredo, por lo que hay que esperar hasta contar el 100% de los votos para saber quién será el segundo en la jerarquía del país asiático.\\nNoticias relacionadas\\n', 132]\n",

He is now in jail.\\nAnother MNLF leader, Parouk Hussin, took over as ARMM governor in 2002.\\nParouk Hussin still retains a loyal support base, but the MNLF has become weaker over the years, and many factions have splintered from the main group.\\nNur Misuari still has a small band of followers, who remain actively opposed to the current situation.\\nIn February 2005, supporters loyal to Misuari launched a series of attacks on army troops in Jolo, the largest of the Sulu islands.\\nThe trigger for the violence was thought to be the launch of a huge military operation to target the armed Muslim group Abu Sayyaf - which is alleged to have ties with the Misuari faction.\\nThere were no major skirmishes until August 2007, when the group said it was behind an ambush on troops in Jolo which led to some of the heaviest fighting in recent years, with nearly 60 dead.\\nMNLF said the ambush had been in retaliation for an army offensive a day earlier that killed four of its members, including a commander.\\nMoro Islamic Liberation Front  (MILF)\\nThe Moro Islamic Liberation Front is a more militant rebel group, which split from the MNLF in 1977.\\nThe MILF has a long-term aim of creating a separate Islamic state in the southern Philippines, but analysts say the group may well settle for a certain degree of Muslim autonomy.\\nThe MILF puts more emphasis on its Islamic roots than the MNLF. Many of its senior figures are clerics.\\nBased in central Mindanao, the MILF has broad popular support in rural areas, where the lack of economic development has encouraged dissent.\\nThe 12,500-strong group was subject to a crackdown in 2000 under the army of then-president Joseph Estrada.\\nRebels groups in Mindanao\\nMILF: 12,000 members, 9,000 firearms\\nCPP/NPA: 3,400 members, 2,300 firearms\\nAbu Sayyaf: 450 members, 350 firearms\\nMisuari followers: 450 members, 450 firearms\\nPentagon group: 200 members, 40 firearms\\nSource: Army intelligence figures 2003\\nBut the mood turned when Gloria Arroyo took power, after Mr Estrada was deposed amid popular protests in 2001.\\nTalks between Manila and the rebels were revived, although they stumbled to a halt a couple of years later when the group was accused of harbouring a gang accused of kidnapping foreigners.\\nMILF was also accused of being behind a bomb blast at Davao City airport in March 2003 which killed 21 people - and multiple murder charges were filed against the group\\'s founder and then leader, Salamat Hashim.\\nBut as 2003 wore on, there were signs of a breakthrough in relations between Manila and the MILF.\\nShortly before his death from a heart attack in July 2003, Salamat Hashim issued a statement renouncing terrorism and underlining the MILF\\'s commitment to achieving a peace settlement.\\nA ceasefire was agreed that year, and both sides have since been engaged in trying to negotiate a peace deal.\\nOne factor which is complicating this process is the allegation that MILF has links with foreign terrorists - including Jemaah Islamiah, the South East Asian group blamed for the 2002 Bali bombings. The MILF denies the claims.\\nDespite the truce, skirmishes continue between troops and MILF militants.\\nIn July 2007, MILF fighters were involved in clashes on Basilan island that left 14 Philippine troops dead, 10 of them reportedly beheaded.\\nMILF said the military had violated the ceasefire agreement by entering its territory without permission, but denied beheading the soldiers or kidnapping the Italian priest which the troops were searching for.\\nAbu Sayyaf\\nAbu Sayyaf is the smallest and most radical of the Islamic separatist groups in the southern Philippines.\\nIt is best-known for a series of kidnappings of Western nationals and Filipinos, for which it has received several large ransom payments.\\nGloria Arroyo restarted negotiations with the MILF\\nIn June 2002, US-trained Philippine commandos tried to rescue three hostages being held on Basilan island. Two of the hostages - one an American citizen - were killed in the resulting shootout.\\nThe group has also claimed responsibility for a series of bomb attacks over the years - including an attack on a passenger ferry in Manila Bay in February 2004 that killed 100 people.\\nAbu Sayyaf\\'s stated goal is an independent Islamic state in Mindanao and the Sulu islands, but the government views the rebels as little more than criminals, and refuses to hold any form of talks with them.\\nAbu Sayyaf - which means \"Sword of God\" in Arabic - split from the MNLF in 1991, under the leadership of Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani, who was killed in a clash with Philippine police in December 1998.\\nHis younger brother, Khadafi Janjalani, took over as leader, although he was killed by Philippines troops in September 2006.\\nNationwide support for Abu Sayyaf is limited, but analysts say many locals in its stronghold areas of Jolo and Basilan tolerate the rebels and even work for them, attracted by the prospect of receiving lucrative ransom payments.\\nBoth the MNLF and MILF have condemned the Abu Sayyaf\\'s activities, and the US has included the group in its list of \"terrorist\" organisations, saying it has links with Osama Bin Laden\\'s al-Qaeda network.\\nUS troops have been helping the Philippines military fight Abu Sayyaf, although they are limited to a training and advisory position as the Philippine constitution bans foreign troops from taking part in actual combat.\\nSince launching a major operation in August 2006, Manila has claimed a series of successes - including the deaths of Janjalani and another senior Abu Sayyaf leader, Abu Sulaiman, also known as Jainal Antal Sali, in January 2007.\\nReports in June 2007 said Abu Sayyaf had chosen Yasser Igasan, one of the group\\'s founders, to succeed Janjalani as leader.\\nBut military chiefs believe Abu Sayyaf\\'s numbers have now fallen to around 200, and they talk confidently of one day wiping out the rebel group entirely.\\nNew People\\'s Army (NPA)\\nThe New People\\'s Army is the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and has been in existence for more than 30 years.\\nThe group, based on the island of Mindanao, has an estimated 10,000 members according to a presidential adviser on the peace process.\\nGovernment troops have been told to hunt down the Abu Sayyaf\\nPeace talks between the CPP and the Philippine Government stalled in June 2001, after the NPA admitted killing a Filipino congressman.\\nThe CPP/NPA was added to Washington\\'s list of foreign \"terrorist\" organisations in August 2002.\\nShortly afterwards, at a request from the Americans, the Dutch Government cancelled benefit payments to group members living in the Netherlands.\\nMany of the NPA\\'s senior figures, including its founder Jose Maria Sison, live in self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and direct operations from there.\\nUnlike the Americans, the Philippine Government does not class the Maoist group as a terrorism organisation.\\nIn February 2004 a peace process was revived, with representatives of the NPA meeting government officials in the Norwegian capital Oslo.\\nThe two sides agreed a series of measures to move towards a formal peace deal.\\nThese included setting up a joint commission to examine human rights abuses on both sides, and working together for the removal of the NPA from the US and EU\\'s list of terrorist organisations.\\n', 145]\n",

Development of San Vicente, a 13- to 14-kilometer strip of white sand compared to Boracay’s four, is to be led by the private sector, which is currently scrambling over plots of land.\\nTourism’s pocket “ace”\\nThe Philippine tourism industry has become the recipient of greater attention thanks to an effective advertising campaign – “It’s more fun in the Philippines” – boosting arrival numbers like never before. Asian markets remain the fastest growing source of tourists, prompting analysts to purchase interests in the high potential of the sector’s gaming and entertainment segment.\\nAccording to DOT figures, arrivals to the Philippines from Malaysia grew 24 per cent in 2012, followed by the 10.46 per cent increase from Taiwan to 216,500 and 3.86 per cent from Japan to 412,400.\\nTo meet the spike in demand from entertainment-seeking arrivals, four mixed entertainment complexes are slated to come up in the National Capital Region by end-2013, including the Solaire Resort & Casino, a high-end complex in Parañaque City.\\n“Ever since the [It’s more fun in the Philippines] campaign came out, people have been noticing the Philippines a lot more, and coincidentally the gaming industry has been opening better casinos,” Certified Securities Representative Liam Ong at Accord Capital told Inside Investor.\\n“Solaire is opening on March 16, and for now I think that’s the ace in the gaming industry.”\\nThe state-led project will open with 500 rooms, taking on an additional 800 rooms by 2014, and growing to over 2,000 rooms by 2016.\\n\\xa0\\n', 179]\n",

      "[4.167528453269205e-05, \"History\\nHistorical Perspective of the Philippine Educational System\\nEducation in the Philippines has undergone several stages of development from the pre-Spanish times to the present. In meeting the needs of the society, education serves as focus of emphases/priorities of the leadership at certain periods/epochs in our national struggle as a race.\\nAs early as in pre-Magellanic times, education was informal, unstructured, and devoid of methods. Children were provided more vocational training and less academics (3 Rs) by their parents and in the houses of tribal tutors.\\nThe pre-Spanish system of education underwent major changes during the Spanish colonization. The tribal tutors were replaced by the Spanish Missionaries. Education was religion-oriented. It was for the elite, especially in the early years of Spanish colonization. Access to education by the Filipinos was later liberalized through the enactment of the Educational Decree of 1863 which provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town under the responsibility of the municipal government; and the establishment of a normal school for male teachers under the supervision of the Jesuits. Primary instruction was free and the teaching of Spanish was compulsory. Education during that period was inadequate, suppressed, and controlled.\\nThe defeat of Spain by American forces paved the way for Aguinaldo's Republic under a Revolutionary Government. The schools maintained by Spain for more than three centuries were closed for the time being but were reopened on August 29, 1898 by the Secretary of Interior. The Burgos Institute in Malolos, the Military Academy of Malolos, and the Literary University of the Philippines were established. A system of free and compulsory elementary education was established by the Malolos Constitution.\\nAn adequate secularized and free public school system during the first decade of American rule was established upon the recommendation of the Schurman Commission. Free primary instruction that trained the people for the duties of citizenship and avocation was enforced by the Taft Commission per instructions of President McKinley. Chaplains and non-commissioned officers were assigned to teach using English as the medium of instruction.\\nA highly centralized public school system was installed in 1901 by the Philippine Commission by virtue of Act No. 74. The implementation of this Act created a heavy shortage of teachers so the Philippine Commission authorized the Secretary of Public Instruction to bring to the Philippines 600 teachers from the U.S.A. They were the Thomasites.\\nYear\\nSuperior Commission of Primary Instruction\\nChairman\\nAct.

In 1908, the Philippine Legislature approved Act No. 1870 which created the University of the Philippines.\\nThe Reorganization Act of 1916 provided the Filipinization of all department secretaries except the Secretary of Public Instruction.\\nJapanese educational policies were embodied in Military Order No. 2 in 1942. The Philippine Executive Commission established the Commission of Education, Health and Public Welfare and schools were reopened in June 1942. On October 14, 1943, the Japanese - sponsored Republic created the Ministry of Education. Under the Japanese regime, the teaching of Tagalog, Philippine History, and Character Education was reserved for Filipinos. Love for work and dignity of labor was emphasized. On February 27, 1945, the Department of Instruction was made part of the Department of Public Instruction.\\nIn 1947, by virtue of Executive Order No. 94, the Department of Instruction was changed to Department of Education. During this period, the regulation and supervision of public and private schools belonged to the Bureau of Public and Private Schools.\\nIn 1972, it became the Department of Education and Culture by virtue of Proclamation 1081 and the Ministry of Education and Culture in 1978 y virtue of P.D. No. 1397. Thirteen regional offices were created and major organizational changes were implemented in the educational system.\\nThe Education Act of 1982 created the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports which later became the Department of Education, Culture and Sports in 1987 by virtue of Executive Order No. 117. The structure of DECS as embodied in EO No. 117 has practically remained unchanged until 1994 when the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), and 1995 when the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) were established to supervise tertiary degree programs and non-degree technical-vocational programs, respectively.\\nThe Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) report provided the impetus for Congress to pass RA 7722 and RA 7796 in 1994 creating the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), respectively.\\nThe trifocal education system refocused DECS’ mandate to basic education which covers elementary, secondary and nonformal education, including culture and sports. TESDA now administers the post-secondary, middle-level manpower training and development while CHED is responsible for higher education.\\nIn August 2001, Republic Act 9155, otherwise called the Governance of Basic Education Act, was passed transforming the name of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) to the Department of Education (DepEd) and redefining the role of field offices (regional offices, division offices, district offices and schools). RA 9155 provides the overall framework for (i) school head empowerment by strengthening their leadership roles and (ii) school-based management within the context of transparency and local accountability. The goal of basic education is to provide the school age population and young adults with skills, knowledge, and values to become caring, self-reliant, productive and patriotic citizens.\\nDepEd Management Structure\\nTo carry out its mandates and objectives, the Department is organized into two major structural components. The Central Office maintains the overall administration of basic education at the national level. The Field Offices are responsible for the regional and local coordination and administration of the Department’s mandate. RA 9155 provides that the Department should have no more than four Undersecretaries and four Assistant Secretaries with at least one Undersecretary and one Assistant Secretary who are career service officers chosen among the staff of the Department. (See DepEd Organizational Chart.)\\nAt present, the Department operates with four Undersecretaries in the areas of: (1) Programs and Projects; (2) Regional Operations; (3) Finance and Administration; and (4) Legal Affairs; four Assistant Secretaries in the areas of: (1) Programs and Projects; (2) Planning and Development; (3) Budget and Financial Affairs; and (4) Legal Affairs.\\nBackstopping the Office of the Secretary at the Central Office are the different services, bureaus and centers. The five services are the Administrative Service, Financial and Management Service, Human Resource Development Service, Planning Service, and Technical Service. Three staff bureaus provide assistance in formulating policies, standards, and programs related to curriculum and staff development. These are the Bureau of Elementary Education (BEE), Bureau of Secondary Education (BSE), and the Bureau of Nonformal Education (BNFE). By virtue of Executive Order No. 81 series of 1999, the functions of a fourth bureau, the Bureau of Physical Education and School Sports (BPESS), were absorbed by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) last August 25, 1999.\\nSix centers or units attached to the Department similarly provide technical and administrative support towards the realization of the Department’s vision. These are the National Education Testing and Research Center (NETRC), Health and Nutrition Center (HNC), National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), Educational Development Projects Implementing Task Force (EDPITAF), National Science Teaching Instrumentation Center (NSTIC), and Instructional Materials Council Secretariat (IMCS). There are four special offices under OSEC: the Adopt-a-School Program Secretariat, Center for Students and Co-curricular Affairs, Educational Technology Unit, and the Task Force Engineering Assessment and Monitoring.\\nOther attached and support agencies to the Department are the Teacher Education Council (TEC), Philippine High School for the Arts, Literacy Coordinating Council (LCC), and the Instructional Materials Council (IMC).\\nAt the sub-national level, the Field Offices consist of the following:\\nSixteen (16) Regional Offices, including the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM*), each headed by a Regional Director (a Regional Secretary in the case of ARMM);\\nOne hundred fifty-seven (157) Provincial and City Schools Divisions, each headed by a Schools Division Superintendent. Assisting the Schools Division Offices are 2,227 School Districts, each headed by a District Supervisor;\\nUnder the supervision of the Schools Division Offices are forty-eight thousand, four hundred forty-six (48, 446) schools, broken down as follows:\\n40,763 elementary schools (36,234 public and 4,529 private)\\n7,683 secondary schools (4,422 public and 3,261 private)\\nLegend:\\n* ARMM is included in the budget of the Department on the following:\\nCreation of teaching and non-teaching positions;\\nFunding for newly-legislated high schools;\\nRegular School Building Program; and\\nCertain foreign-assisted and locally-funded programs and projects.\\n\\xa0\\nTransparency Info\\nThe Transparency Seal is a symbol of a policy shift towards openness in access to government information.\\n\", 212]\n",

Except for the 1942-45 Japanese occupation during World War II, the Philippines had been under U.S. administration since the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898.\\nThe U.S.-Philippine Bilateral Strategic Dialogue advances discussion and cooperation on bilateral, regional, and global issues. U.S.-Philippine relations are based on strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and human rights. The United States has designated the Philippines as a Major Non-NATO Ally, and there are close and abiding security ties between the two nations. The Manila Declaration signed in 2011 reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty as the foundation for a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. There is also a focus on economic, commercial, and people-to-people ties. There are an estimated four million U.S. citizens of Philippine ancestry in the United States, and more than 220,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines, including a large presence of United States veterans. An estimated 650,000 U.S. citizens visit the Philippines each year. Many people-to-people programs exist between the United States and the Philippines, including Fulbright, International Visitor Leadership Program, and the Kenney-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study program.\\nManila is home to the only VA benefits office and healthcare clinic outside the United States, and the American Cemetery in Manila is the largest American military cemetery outside the United States.\\nU.S. Assistance to Philippines\\nThe U.S. government’s goal in the Philippines is to partner with the country to become a stable and prosperous nation. The 2011 Partnership for Growth Statement of Principles reinforced a shared interest in promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth in the Philippines. U.S. assistance to the Philippines fosters broad-based economic growth; improves the health and education of Filipinos; promotes peace and security; advances democratic values, good governance, and human rights; and strengthens regional and global partnerships. Department of State, Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao aim to strengthen the foundation for peace and stability in the area. U.S. assistance, including from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, seeks to intensify cooperation through a whole-of-government approach, using a wide range of assistance and other foreign policy tools. The United States has had a Peace Corps program in the Philippines for over 50 years.\\nOver the last decade, disaster relief and recovery has also become an increasingly important area of assistance to the Philippines. The United States has provided over $143 million in assistance to date to the people of the Philippines in relief and recovery efforts after Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda devastated the country in 2013. The United States continues to support long-term reconstruction and rebuilding efforts.\\nBilateral Economic Relations\\nThe United States and the Philippines have a strong trade and investment relationship, with over $25 billion in goods and services traded. The United States is one of the largest foreign investors in the Philippines, and is the Philippines’ third-largest trading partner. The Philippines has been among the largest beneficiaries of the Generalized System of Preferences program for developing countries, which provides preferential duty-free access to the U.S. market.\\nKey imports from the Philippines are semiconductor devices and computer peripherals, automobile parts, electric machinery, textiles and garments, wheat and animal feeds, coconut oil, and information technology/business process outsourcing services. Key U.S. exports to the Philippines are machinery, cereals, raw and semi-processed materials for the manufacture of semiconductors, electronics, and transport equipment. The two countries have a bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, signed in 1989, and a tax treaty.\\nThe Embassy is working to advance several key Environment, Science, Technology, and Health issues. The Philippines is an important partner on climate change and submitted an “intended nationally determined contribution” (INDC) prior to the December 2015 COP 21 meetings in Paris. USAID is providing key technical assistance to help ensure the Philippines’ INDC is meaningful and science-based.\\nPhilippines's Membership in International Organizations\\nThe Philippines and the United States belong to a many of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN Regional Forum, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. The Philippines is also an observer to the Organization of American States. The Philippines serves as chair and host of ASEAN for 2017.\\nBilateral Representation\\nThe U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines is Sung Y. Kim ; other principal embassy officials are listed in the Department's Key Officers List.\\nThe Philippines maintains an embassy in the United States at 1600 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036 (tel. 202-467-9300).\\nMore information about Philippines is available from the Department of State and other sources, some of which are listed here:\\n\", 135]\n",
      "[2.3998606644037497e-05, 'Philippine Tourism > Where to go\\nFrom http://www.dotpcvc.gov.ph/\\nBanaue of Painterly Dreams\\nBecause of its high altitude, Banaue is often        described as \"where land merges with the clouds to meet        the heavens\" with the rice terraces as \"the stairway to        the sky.\"\\nBanaue is a place for nature adventures and cultural        immersion. Days are for indulging in such activities as        strolling, biking, and trekking. Evenings are for        campfire chats at a village or warm indoor cosseting at        the lodges and inns.\\nA leading tourism destination in Asia, the Banaue rice        terraces start from the base of the Cordilleras and        reach up to several thousand feet high. Its length, if        stretched from end to end, could encircle half of the        globe.\\nThe rice paddies are fed by mountain springs and streams        that are channeled into an irrigation canal that runs        downhill through the terraces.\\nIn the village of Batad, the terraces take the shape of        an amphitheater and can be reached by a 12-kilometer        ride from Banaue Hotel and a 2-hour hike through        mountain trails.\\nAfter trekking through the terraces, cool retreats indeed are the        spring-fed stream of Guihob and the magnificent Tappiya        Waterfalls which has an enormous basin for swimming.\\nShopping takes a different twist in Banaue. While        souvenir items are offered by curio stores, the more        exciting way to shop, however, is to go on a village        visit, watch a family demonstrate their native craft and        then haggle for a better price on their product.\\nAwesome Hills\\nChocolate Hills is a series of 1,268 perfectly       symmetrical, haycock-shaped hills that rise some 30 meters       above the ground. A National Geologic Monument, these       unique, rock formations were cast after million years of       evolution.\\nSpread out in the towns of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan, the       hills are so-called because they resemble chocolate bonbons       when their grass cover turns to brown at the onset of       summer. Two of the hills have been developed and provided       with facilities, including a viewdeck, a youth hostel and a       restaurant.\\nOther hills with a commanding view of the surrounding       islands include Banat-I and Elly in the capital city of       Tagbilaran, Himontagon in the town of Loay, Sampoangan in       Calape and Ilihan in Jagna.\\nBarefoot in the Beach\\nThe code in Boracay is strictly informal.\\nThere is an undeniable easy atmosphere in Boracay where walking      barefoot than shod is the rule rather than the exception. White      Beach is so, soooo fine, it feels like treading on miles of baby      powder! No wonder, even swinging discos have the beach for a      floor, giving dance a new twist.\\nThere are no hang-ups either in this island. At daytime,      tourists having a soothing massage under the shade of a coconut      tree beside the shoreline is a common sight. And from dusk to      dawn, Boracay turns into one big party place where everyone is      welcome to join in…But first, let\\'s toast that sunset cocktail!\\nDiversions are certainly no problem in this tropical eden with      leisure activities calendared throughout the year and amenities      offered by some 350 tourist establishments.\\nThe Isle of Your Tropical Dreams\\nCebu is the traveler\\'s fantasy of a tropical island come       true - balmy weather, pristine beaches, crystalline waters,       and luxurious resorts with all the frills of modern living.\\nThe island-province of Cebu was where the Portuguese       navigator Ferdinand Magellan planted the Cross of       Christianity in the name of Spain in 1521. But even before       Cebu became the Occidental gateway to the Orient, it was       already a popular entry point among Asian merchants.\\nCebu has since blossomed into a choice tourist       destination, with many leisure establishments taking full       advantage of its sea-valley-and-mountain location.\\nMetropolitan Cebu, the country\\'s second biggest metropolis,       is the political, economic, educational and cultural center       of the Visayas. Hotels, shopping malls, entertainment halls,       casinos and golf fairways are ever present in the metro to       cater to every tourist\\'s whim.\\nThe rest of Cebu\\'s 166 islands and islets are fringed       with sandy beaches and sapphire-clear waters teeming with       marine life, perfect for divers.\\n\\xa0\\nLand of Plenty\\n\"Kadayawan sa Dabaw\" is Davao City\\'s premier festival and       showcases the natural and cultural bounty of the land.\\nA movable feast in August, the week-long merrymaking       highlights the manifold tribal cultures of the region which       are vividly expressed in traditional songs, dances, games       and crafts. It is also on this occasion when a lively trade       fair, capped by a flower-and-fruit float parade, takes       place. Street dancing and popular entertainment complete the       celebration.\\nAgriculture-based industries thrive in the Davao region. A       major exporter of bananas, citrus, mangosteen and other       tropical fruits, it is also the biggest producer of cultured       flowers in the country. Its surrounding waters are rich       sources for commercial fishing.\\nThe world\\'s largest city in terms of land area, Davao covers       all of 244,000 hectares.\\nManila\\nThe capital of the Philippines - its heart and soul -- is       Manila. It sets the rhythm of life in this archipelago and       is a pulsating hub that blends the Oriental with the       Occidental, the quaint with the modern, the mundane with the       extraordinary.\\nManila was born out of the ashes of a once flourishing       Malay settlement by the banks of the Pasig River. In 1571,       Miguel Lopez de Legazpi established the Ever Loyal City of       Manila which, until 1898, was the seat of Spanish colonial       rule in Asia. He built the city within walls and called it       Intramuros.\\nAn anchor tourist destination, Manila is the very core of       the 7,000 times more islands that make up the Philippines.       It is a center for the performing arts in Asia.\\nThe Last Frontier\\nUnique to Palawan is its megadiversity.\\nFor a long time, Palawan\\'s bountiful resources, abundant wildlife and    extraordinary natural beauty are known only to the many ethnic    communities that thrive in these islands and a few other daring settlers    who wanted to live in unpolluted surroundings.\\nThe island-province first attracted foreign attention in the 1970\\'s when    it became a United Nations Vietnamese Refugee Center. At this time, a    disturbance in Kenya also saw the transport of endangered animals from    its savannas to the plains of Calauit Island.\\nHowever, it was only a sea accident in 1979 that eventually led to the    opening of Palawan into tourism big time.\\nAs the story goes, a tuna line disabled a dive boat\\'s propeller in the    middle of the night forcing it to drop anchor in an inlet. The following    morning, the divers woke up to an amazing scenery of skyscraping dark    cliffs, thick green forest, white-sand beach, sparkling water and,    rising above it, a series of magnificently sculpted jade islands. And    thus was how El Nido was discovered.\\nEcology awareness is at a high level throughout the province. Puerto    Princesa prides itself as the cleanest city in the Philippines. To    protect its megadiversity, only eco-friendly programs are adhered to by    tourist establishments. And there are strict ordinances against dynamite    fishing, with only net and line fishing allowed.\\nPalawan may have opened itself to tourism but it has also taken serious    efforts to preserve this last frontier.\\nOld World City\\nVigan, with its centuries-old edifices, is a breathing       reminder of what was once a royal city.\\nOne of the earliest Spanish settlements in the country,       Vigan was founded in 1572 by Juan de Salcedo who patterned       its design to that of Intramuros (Old Manila). It became the       seat of the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia and was called       Ciudad Fernandina in honor of King Ferdinand.\\nToday, Vigan retains much of the patina of 18th century       Castillan architecture as seen in some 150 stone houses       which stand in the town\\'s Mestizo District, notably Mena       Crisologo Street. Many of these ancestral homes are still in       good condition and some have been turned into cozy inns,       museums, and souvenir shops.\\nAlong with the homes are other vestiges of the town\\'s       colonial past:\\nThe majestic St. Paul\\'s Cathedral was built by the       Augustinian friars along the distinct \"Earthquake Baroque\" style of the Ilocos region and features Neo-Gothic and       pseudo Romanesque motifs. Standing on an elevation west of       the cathedral is Plaza Salcedo, the oldest monument in       Northern Luzon. The Archbishop\\'s Palace is a rich repository       of religious artifacts from the Ilocos region. Plaza Burgos       was built in honor of Fr. Jose Burgos, one of three Filipino       priests who were garroted by the Spaniards for espousing       church reforms.\\nBut it is not only edifices which are preserved in this town       inscribed in the World Heritage List. Viganos also remain       steadfast in their traditional crafts, notably pottery       (burnay) and handloom weaving (inabel).\\nThe horse-drawn calesa (rig) is as much a presence in the       streets as motor vehicles.\\nCopyright © 2009\\n', 181]\n",

      "[1.8164436074383737e-05, \"Last Laugh for the Philippines; Onetime Joke Economy Avoids Much of Asia's Turmoil\\nBy EDWARD A. GARGAN\\nContinue reading the main story\\nChristmas roars into the Philippines with sacks of red ribbons and plastic fir trees festooned in frosted and sequined glass bulbs. Streets are lathered in glowing stars, six-foot candles and light displays of Santa's sleigh dashing through the tropical humidity.\\nDetermined not to be left out, the central bank on Roxas Boulevard has draped its office block in a lighted display of its own: four mammoth line charts tracking the country's inflation, foreign exchange reserves, economic growth and the rate on 91-day Treasury bills.\\nMerry Christmas.\\nIndeed, in the Philippines, long regarded as a comedic, boisterously democratic laggard, the turmoil afflicting other Asian economies has left many people feeling a bit merrier than usual at this time of year. The thunder of collapsing banks and the cracking of economic hubris elsewhere are even making Filipinos a bit smug.\\nThe Philippines has been hit by a fall in its own currency and stock market in recent months, yet it has not experienced the more damaging banking and real estate chaos that has afflicted other countries in East Asia.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nUnlike Bangkok and Jakarta, where cranes stand frozen over dozens of abandoned building sites, Manila is a hive of construction; with occupancy rates in the business districts at 98 to 99 percent, the thirst for new buildings remains strong. And while Bangkok's projected light-rail line is just a procession of silent concrete pillars, workers swarm over the site of Manila's new overhead light-rail line, work that has turned one of the city's main arteries, Edsa Boulevard, into a monumental traffic jam.\\nContinue reading the main story\\nThe Philippines has proved the exception mainly because it has not tried to leap ahead as suddenly as its neighbors, taking a conservative tack at least partly mandated by the International Monetary Fund.\\n''There's a bit of truth to the case of the turtle and the hare,'' laughed Washington SyCip, the 75-year-old founder of SGV Group, the country's largest insurance conglomerate, and widely regarded as the dean of the country's financial sector. By moving slowly, he said, the nation did not ''make all the mistakes of our neighbors.''\\nForeign investors, rather than shying away in alarm, as they have elsewhere in the region, are still coming in. Acer, Taiwan's largest computer maker, is building a huge manufacturing center at Subic Bay. Intel, already the country's largest exporter, is expanding its production. And Seagate, an American maker of hard-disk drives, is planning to open a plant here.\\nIndeed, while countries across Asia, from Thailand to Indonesia to South Korea, are begging the I.M.F. to rescue them, the Philippines is toying with the notion of leaving I.M.F. supervision this month after 34 years, having successfully met the fund's targets for economic stability.\\n''We learned our lessons much earlier, and the past five years have been a time of resolute and pervasive correction and reform,'' President Fidel Ramos said during a visit to the United States last month. ''In the Philippines, we have felt the lash of the turmoil, although we have not been guilty of the mistakes'' made by other Asian countries.\\n''The Philippines,'' Mr. Ramos argued, ''has passed third base and is heading for home plate, meaning an exit from our I.M.F. program.''\\nIn a sense, it hardly matters whether Manila leaves fund supervision; the mere discussion of such a step sets the country apart from its neighbors and provides evidence of an economy distinctly better off than the savaged economies nearby.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\n[Indeed, the Philippine central bank announced on Wednesday that its economy is stable enough to allow it to cut its key overnight borrowing rate to 11 percent, the lowest level since the currency turmoil began sweeping through the region in July.]\\nIn some ways. to be sure, the Philippines has mimicked the problems that have sparked the Asian crisis. The peso has plunged nearly 30 percent in value, and the Manila stock market, perhaps because many outsiders fail to distinguish it from its neighbors, has tumbled about 35 percent since July.\\nBut the Philippines has resisted the impulse to erect the world's tallest building, to make a ''national'' car (while imposing high tariffs on competitors), to build a ''national'' airplane or to create a new capital. In short, it has eschewed the hubris that has infected many Asian tigers.\\n''We've gotten away from trying to devise a national car, or steel plant, or an aircraft industry,'' argued Victor S. Limlingan, a senior professor at the Asian Institute of Management, a leading business school. ''We have liberalized the economy. There are virtually no tariff protections. What's saving us is the liberalization program. Growth has spread out.''\\nDecades of I.M.F. supervision have, virtually all economists concur, set the country's economy firmly on rails leading to steady but unostentatious growth. In the last six years, under President Ramos, the Government has divested itself of everything from the national airline to electric power systems, banks to water supplies -- or is in the process of doing so. The Government's budget is in surplus, and sweeping reforms that would simplify the tax code while increasing revenues are on the brink of passage. And unlike Thailand, where banks are straining under a rate of bad loans over 20 percent, Philippine banks boast a rate of only 3.4 percent.\\nNewsletter Sign Up\\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\\nInvalid email address.

''Monetary policy wasn't too bold. And the structure of the economy is not like Thailand, for example, which borrowed huge amounts externally.''\\nMatthew S. Sutherland, head of Philippine research at Paribas Asia Equity, added: ''I don't think we have the systemic problems of the rest of Asia. The property sector is not overblown; banking is not in trouble; there has not been a lot of borrowing in U.S. dollars. We don't need three years of a tighter belt and severe austerity.''\\nAfter the collapse of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, a lot of the flagrant cronyism and corruption he nurtured died as well. And though corruption still exists, the privatization of much of the economy and an increasing openness in economic decision-making have wiped out a fair amount of the cronyism in business and government.\\nIn part, it is from the factories of people like Victoria Reyes that the Philippines is drawing its strength. From a desire to earn enough to carpet her house, Ms. Reyes built a large textile business, Remerco Garments Manufacturing Inc., which at its height employed more than 800 people. And all her production was exported.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nNorth and east of Manila, in Quezon City, in what used to be rice paddies and is now a warren of cement-block-walled factory compounds, Ms. Reyes and her children live and work on land that has been in the family for generations. Under a corrugated roof, with the walls open to the languid humidity of the tropics, 250 women hunch over Taiwan-made sewing machines churning out Chicago Bulls jackets, children's dresses, multicolored flannel jackets and denim children's pants.\\n''Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka are our big competitors,'' Ms. Reyes said. ''Of course China is big, too. In 1980, with China taking off, our European buyers dropped us like a sack of potatoes. But when they didn't get deliveries they came crawling back. I said no.'' In those days, the waning days of Marcos's martial law regime, days when the country's economy was stagnant, Ms. Reyes was one of the top 10 exporters in the Philippines.\\nA strike by workers in 1990 almost destroyed the business, and even Ms. Reyes acknowledged that she shared some blame. ''Our pride got the better of us,'' she confessed. But by 1995,  she was back, buoyed by the firm support of her two major American buyers and a Hong Kong garment house. Today, she said, ''it's a big small operation.''\\nThe operation is more efficient than ever. ''We're doing production levels we had with 600 people,'' she said. Still, as at all businesses in the Philippines, the falling peso and often usurious interest rates have required fast footwork. ''We had about a $1 million loan in pesos,'' explained her son, Rufino A. Reyes Jr., the company's vice president. ''Loan interest was 30 percent. It was too much for us to pay. I went to the bank and said I wanted to swap the peso loan to a dollar loan, since all our income is in dollars. So they did, and the interest rate is now 11 percent -- still high, but we can make it.''\\nWith $7 million to $8 million in sales, Remerco is relatively small next to the electronics giants -- electronics constitute about 51 percent of the total exports of the Philippines -- and competition remains fierce throughout the region. ''Right now we're banking on our long-term relationship with our buyers,'' Mr. Reyes said. ''But we have to be realistic that competition will be more.''\\nAnd with companies from Remerco to Intel expanding, Philippine exports have climbed more than 25 percent in the last year. Many analysts expect foreign and domestic investment to continue to grow.\\n''A lot is going on in industrial zones,'' said Jose Mario I. Cuyegkeng, research director at ING Baring Securities. ''And while we have one of the highest wages in the region, we have the higher productivity. Many people here speak English, and we have one of the cheapest middle-management salary structures anywhere.''\\nFor companies with domestic markets, things are likely to be tougher in the coming year. One tile maker, who insisted on anonymity, explained that with domestic business loan rates so high, he would have to put off his expansion plans for a while.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nThere are already signs that consumer spending is waning. The most recent data available indicate that sales of many larger items began to fall in July, particularly televisions, fans and washing machines.\\nEven so, Roberto C. Benares, who runs a small investment bank here, the Asian Alliance Investment Corporation, said that while he foresaw  more mergers and acquisitions as some companies faced difficulties (there have been almost no initial public offerings on the Manila exchange since July), he remained confident that the country's fundamentals and its corporate base were sound. ''If you look at the property groups, they're slowing down a bit,'' he said. ''But they will survive. The banking sector is going to be O.K. They have been through so many troughs, they're overcautious, unlike Thai banks. Everybody is still upbeat.''\\nMost frustrating, said Mr. SyCip of SGV, is the tendency of bankers and investors outside Asia to lump the region into one pot. ''All countries in the region do have problems,'' he said, ''but not serious enough for 50 percent declines in stock markets -- except for Thailand. Here, building is still going on. Our banking system is much more transparent. Our export figures are comfortably up, and a lot of plants are coming on line. It's a failure to distinguish one country from another.''\\n\", 8]\n",
      "[1.8058905399930165e-05, 'MACASSAR TO THE ARU ISLANDS IN A NATIVE PRAU\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(DECEMBER, 1856)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0IT was the beginning of December, and the rainy season at Macassar had just set in. For nearly three months had beheld the sun rise daily above the palm-groves, mount to the zenith, and descend like a globe of fire into the ocean, unobscured for a single moment of his course. Now dark leaden clouds had gathered over the whole heavens, and seemed to have rendered him permanently invisible. The strong east winds, warm and dry and dust-laden, which had hitherto blown as certainly as the sun had risen, were now replaced by variable gusty breezes and heavy rains, often continuous for three days and nights together; and the parched and fissured rice stubbles which during the dry weather had extended in every direction for miles around the town, were already so flooded as to be only passable by boats, or by means of a labyrinth of paths on the top of the narrow banks which divided the separate properties.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Five months of this kind of weather might be expected in Southern Celebes, and I therefore determined to seek some more favourable climate for collecting in during that period, and to return in the next dry season to complete my exploration of the district. Fortunately for me I was in one of the treat emporiums of the native trade of the archipelago. Rattans from Borneo, sandal-wood and bees\\'-was from Flores and Timor, tripang from the Gulf of Carpentaria, cajputi-oil from Bouru, wild nutmegs and mussoi-bark from New Guinea, are all to be found in the stores of the Chinese and Bugis merchants of Macassar, along with the rice and coffee which are the chief products of the surrounding country. More important than all these however is the trade to Aru, a group of islands situated on the south-west coast of New Guinea, and of which almost the whole produce comes to Macassar in native vessels. These islands are quite out of the track of all European trade, and are inhabited only by black mop-headed savages, who yet contribute to the luxurious tastes of the most civilized races. Pearls, mother-of-pearl, and tortoiseshell find their way to Europe, while edible birds\\' nests and \"tripang\" or sea-slug are obtained by shiploads for the gastronomic enjoyment of the Chinese.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The trade to these islands has existed from very early times, and it is from them that Birds of Paradise, of the two kinds known to Linnaeus were first brought The native vessels can only make the voyage once a year, owing to the monsoons. They leave Macassar in December or January at the beginning of the west monsoon, and return in July or August with the full strength of the east monsoon. Even by the Macassar people themselves, the voyage to the Aru Islands is looked upon as a rather wild and romantic expedition, fall of novel sights and strange adventures. He who has made it is looked up to as an authority, and it remains with many the unachieved ambition of their lives. I myself had hoped rather than expected ever to reach this \"Ultima Thule\" of the East: and when I found that I really could do so now, had I but courage to trust myself for a thousand miles\\' voyage in a  Bugis prau, and for six or seven months among lawless traders and ferocious savages, I felt somewhat as I did when, a schoolboy, I was for the first time allowed to travel outside the stage-coach, to visit that scene of all that is strange and new and wonderful to young imaginations-London!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0By the help of some kind friends I was introduced to the owner of one of the large praus which was to sail in a few days. He was a Javanese half-caste, intelligent, mild, and gentlemanly in his manners, and had a young and pretty Dutch wife, whom he was going to leave behind during his absence. When we talked about passage money he would fix no sum, but insisted on leaving it entirely to me to pay on my return exactly what I liked. \"And then,\" said he, \"whether you give me one dollar or a hundred, I shall he satisfied, and shall ask no more.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The remainder of my stay was fully occupied in laying in stores, engaging servants, and making every other preparation for an absence of seven months from even the outskirts of civilization. On the morning of December 13th, when we went on board at daybreak, it was raining hard. We set sail and it came on to blow. Our boat was lost astern, our sails damaged, and the evening found us hack again in Macassar harbour. We remained there four days longer, owing to its raining all the time, thus rendering it impossible to dry and repair the huge mat sails. All these dreary days I remained on board, and during the rare intervals when it didn\\'t rain, made myself acquainted with our outlandish craft, some of the peculiarities of which I will now endeavour to describe.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It was a vessel of about seventy tons burthen, and shaped something like a Chinese junk. The deck sloped considerably downward to the bows, which are thus the lowest part of the ship. There were two large rudders, but instead of being planed astern they were hung on the quarters from strong cross beams, which projected out two or three feet on each side, and to which extent the deck overhung the sides of the vessel amidships. The rudders were not hinged but hung with slings of rattan, the friction of which keeps them in any position in which they are placed, and thus perhaps facilitates steering. The tillers were not on deck, but entered the vessel through two square openings into a lower or half deck about three feet high, in which sit the two steersmen. In the after part of the vessel was a low poop, about three and a half feet high, which forms the captain\\'s cabin, its furniture consisting of boxes, mats, and pillows. In front of the poop and mainmast was a little thatched house on deck, about four feet high to the ridge; and one compartment of this, forming a cabin six and a half feet long by five and a half wide, I had all to myself, and it was the snuggest and most comfortable little place I ever enjoyed at sea. It was entered by a low sliding door of thatch on one side, and had a very small window on the other. The floor was of split bamboo, pleasantly elastic, raised six inches above the deck, so as to be quite dry. It was covered with fine cane mats, for the manufacture of which Macassar is celebrated; against the further wall were arranged my guncase, insect-boxes, clothes, and books; my mattress occupied the middle, and next the door were my canteen, lamp, and little store of luxuries for the voyage; while guns, revolver, and hunting knife hung conveniently from the roof. During these four miserable days I was quite jolly in this little snuggery more so than I should have been if confined the same time to the gilded and uncomfortable saloon of a first-class steamer. Then, how comparatively sweet was everything on board--no paint, no tar, no new rope, (vilest of smells to the qualmish!) no grease, or oil, or varnish; but instead of these, bamboo and rattan, and coir rope and palm thatch; pure vegetable fibres, which smell pleasantly if they smell at all, and recall quiet scenes in the green and shady forest.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our ship had two masts, if masts they can be called c which were great moveable triangles. If in an ordinary ship you replace the shrouds and backstay by strong timbers, and take away the mast altogether, you have the arrangement adopted on board a prau. Above my cabin, and resting on cross-beams attached to the masts, was a wilderness of yards and spars, mostly formed of bamboo. The mainyard, an immense affair nearly a hundred feet long, was formed of many pieces of wood and bamboo bound together with rattans in an ingenious manner. The sail carried by this was of an oblong shape, and was hung out of the centre, so that when the short end was hauled down on deck the long end mounted high in the air, making up for the lowness of the mast itself. The foresail was of the same shape, but smaller. Both these were of matting, and, with two jibs and a fore and aft sail astern of cotton canvas, completed our rig.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The crew consisted of about thirty men, natives of Macassar and the adjacent coasts and islands. They were  mostly young, and were short, broad-faced, good-humoured looking fellows. Their dress consisted generally of a pair of trousers only, when at work, and a handkerchief twisted round the head, to which in the evening they would add a thin cotton jacket. Four of the elder men were \"jurumudis,\" or steersmen, who had to squat (two at a time) in the little steerage before described, changing every six hours. Then there was an old man, the \"juragan,\" or captain, but who was really what we should call the first mate; he occupied the other half of the little house on deck. There were about ten respectable men, Chinese or Bugis, whom our owner used to call \"his own people.\" He treated them very well, shared his meals with them, and spoke to them always with perfect politeness; yet they were most of them a kind of slave debtors, bound over by the police magistrate to work for him at mere nominal wages for a term of years till their debts were liquidated. This is a Dutch institution in this part of the world, and seems to work well. It is a great boon to traders, who can do nothing in these thinly- populated regions without trusting goods to agents and petty dealers, who frequently squander them away in gambling and debauchery. The lower classes are almost all in a chronic state of debt. The merchant trusts them again and again, till the amount is something serious, when he brings them to court and has their services allotted to him for its liquidation. The debtors seem to think this no disgrace, but rather enjoy their freedom from responsibility, and the dignity of their position under a wealthy and well-known merchant. They trade a little on their own account, and both parties seem to get on very well together. The plan seems a more sensible one than that which we adopt, of effectually preventing a man from earning anything towards paying his debts by shutting him up in a jail.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My own servants were three in number. Ali, the Malay boy whom I had picked up in Borneo, was my head man. He had already been with me a year, could turn his hand to anything, and was quite attentive and trustworthy. He was a good shot, and fond of shooting, and I had taught him to skin birds very well. The second, named Baderoon, was a Macassar lad; also a pretty good boy, but a desperate gambler. Under pretence of buying a house for his mother, and clothes, for himself, he had received four months\\' wages about a week before we sailed, and in a day or two gambled away every dollar of it. He had come on board with no clothes, no betel, or tobacco, or salt fish, all which necessary articles I was obliged to send Ali to buy for him. These two lads were about sixteen, I should suppose; the third was younger, a sharp little rascal named Baso, who had been with me a month or two, and had learnt to cook tolerably. He was to fulfil the important office of cook and housekeeper, for I could not get any regular servants to go to such a terribly remote country; one might as well ask a chef de cuisine to go to Patagonia.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the fifth day that I had spent on board (Dec. 15th) the rain ceased, and final preparations were made for starting. Sails were dried and furled, boats were constantly coming and going, and stores for the voyage, fruit, vegetables, fish, and palm sugar, were taken on board. In the afternoon two women arrived with a large party of friends and relations, and at parting there was a general noserubbing (the Malay kiss), and some tears shed. These were promising symptoms for our getting off the next day; and accordingly, at three in the morning, the owner came on board, the anchor was immediately weighed, and by four we set sail. Just as we were fairly off and clear of the other praus, the old juragan repeated some prayers, all around responding with \"Allah il Allah,\" and a few strokes on a gong as an accompaniment, concluding with all wishing each other \"Salaamat jalan,\" a safe and happy journey. We had a light breeze, a calm sea, and a fine morning, a prosperous commencement of our voyage of about a thousand miles to the far-famed Aru Islands.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The wind continued light and variable all day, with a calm in the evening before the land breeze sprang up, were then passing the island of \"Tanakaki \"(foot of the land), at the extreme south of this part of Celebes. There are some dangerous rocks here, and as I was standing by the bulwarks, I happened to spit over the side; one of the men begged I would not do so just now, but spit on deck, as they were much afraid of this place. Not quite comprehending, I made him repeat his request, when, seeing he was in earnest, I said, \"Very well, I suppose there are \\'hantus\\' (spirits) here.\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"and they don\\'t like anything to be thrown overboard; many a prau has been lost by doing it.\" Upon which I promised to be very careful. At sunset the good Mahometans on board all repeated a few words of prayer with a general chorus, reminding me of the pleasing and impressive \"Ave. Maria\" of Catholic countries.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 20th. - At sunrise we were opposite the Bontyne mountain, said to be one of the highest in Celebes. In the afternoon we passed the Salayer Straits and had a little squall, which obliged us to lower our huge mast, sails, and heavy yards. The rest of the evening we had a fine west wind, which carried us on at near five knots an hour, as much as our lumbering old tub can possibly go.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 21st. - A heavy swell from the south-west rolling us about most uncomfortably. A steady wind was blowing however, and we got on very well.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 22cd. - The swell had gone down. We passed Boutong, a large island, high, woody, and populous, the native place of some of our crew. A small prau returning from Bali to the, island of Goram overtook us. The nakoda (captain) was known to our owner. They had been two years away, but were full of people, with several black Papuans on board. At 6 P.M. we passed Wangiwangi, low but not flat, inhabited and subject to Boutong. We had now fairly entered the Molucca Sea. After dark it was a beautiful sight to look down on our rudders, from which rushed eddying streams of phosphoric light gemmed with whirling sparks of fire. It resembled (more nearly than anything else to which I can compare it) one of the large irregular nebulous star-clusters seen through a good telescope, with the additional attraction of ever-changing form and dancing motion.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 23rd. - Fine red sunrise; the island we left last evening barely visible behind us. The Goram prau about a mile south of us. They have no compass, yet they have kept a very true course during the night. Our owner tells me they do it by the swell of the sea, the direction of which they notice at sunset, and sail by it during the night. In these seas they are never (in fine weather) more than two days without seeing land. Of course adverse winds or currents sometimes carry them away, but they soon fall in with some island, and there are always some old sailors on board who know it, and thence take a new course. Last night a shark about five feet long was caught, and this morning it was cut up and cooked. In the afternoon they got another, and I had a little fried, and found it firm and dry, but very palatable. In the evening the sun set in a heavy bank of clouds, which, as darkness came on, assumed a fearfully black appearance. According to custom, when strong wind or rain is expected, our large sails -were furled, and with their yards let down on deck, and a small square foresail alone kept up. The great mat sails are most awkward things to manage in rough weather. The yards which support them are seventy feet long, and of course very heavy, and the only way to furl them being to roll up the sail on the boom, it is a very dangerous thing to have them standing when overtaken by a squall. Our crew; though numerous enough for a vessel of 700 instead of one of 70 tons, have it very much their own way, and there seems to be seldom more than a dozen at work at a time. When anything important is to be done, however, all start up willingly enough, but then all think themselves at liberty to give their opinion, and half a dozen voices are heard giving orders, and there is such a shrieking and confusion that it seems wonderful anything gets done at all.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Considering we have fifty men of several tribes and tongues onboard, wild, half-savage looking fellows, and few of them feeling any of the restraints of morality or education, we get on wonderfully well. There is no fighting or quarrelling, as there would certainly be among the same number of Europeans with as little restraint upon their actions, and there is scarcely any of that noise and excitement which might be expected. In fine weather the greater part of them are quietly enjoying themselves- -some are sleeping under the shadow of the sails; others, in little groups of three or four, are talking or chewing betel; one is making a new handle to his chopping-knife, another is stitching away at a new pair of trousers or a shirt, and all are as quiet and well-conducted as on board the best-ordered English merchantman. Two or three take it by turns to watch in the bows and see after the braces and halyards of the great sails; the two steersmen are below in the steerage; our captain, or the juragan, gives the course, guided partly by the compass and partly by the direction of the wind, and a watch of two or three on the poop look after the trimming of the sails and call out the hours by the water-clock. This is a very ingenious contrivance, which measures time well in both rough weather and fine. It is simply a bucket half filled with water, in which floats the half of a well-scraped cocoa-nut shell. In the bottom of this shell is a very small hole, so that when placed to float in the bucket a fine thread of water squirts up into it. This gradually fills the shell, and the size of the hole is so adjusted to the capacity of the vessel that, exactly at the end of an hour, plump it goes to the bottom. The watch then cries out the number of hours from sunrise and sets the shell afloat again empty. This is a very good measurer of time. I tested it with my watch and found that it hardly varied a minute from one hour to another, nor did the motion of the vessel have any effect upon it, as the water in the bucket of course kept level. It has a great advantage for a rude people in being easily understood, in being rather bulky and easy to see, and in the final submergence being accompanied with a little bubbling and commotion of the water, which calls the attention to it. It is also quickly replaced if lost while in harbour.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our captain and owner I find to be a quiet, good-tempered man, who seems to get on very well with all about him. When at sea he drinks no wine or spirits, but indulges only in coffee and cakes, morning and afternoon, in company with his supercargo and assistants. He is a man of some little education, can read and write well both Dutch and Malay, uses a compass, and has a chart. He has been a trader to Aru for many years, and is well known to both Europeans and natives in this part of the world.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 24th. - Fine, and little wind. No land in sight for the first time since we left Macassar. At noon calm, with heavy showers, in which our crew wash their clothes, anti in the afternoon the prau is covered with shirts, trousers, and sarongs of various gay colours. I made a discovery to-day which at first rather alarmed me. The two ports, or openings, through which the tillers enter from the lateral rudders are not more than three or four feet above the surface of the water, which thus has a free entrance into the vessel. I of course had imagined that this open space from one side to the other was separated from the hold by a water-tight bulkhead, so that a sea entering might wash out at the further side, and do no more harm than give the steersmen a drenching. To my surprise end dismay, however, I find that it is completely open to the hold, so that half-a-dozen seas rolling in on a stormy night would nearly, or quite, swamp us. Think of a vessel going to sea for a month with two holes, each a yard square, into the hold, at three feet above the water-line,-holes, too, which cannot possibly be closed! But our captain says all praus are so; and though he acknowledges the danger, \"he does not know how to alter it--the people are used to it; he does not understand praus so well as they do, and if such a great alteration were made, he should be sure to have difficulty in getting a crew!\" This proves at all events that praus must be good sea-boats, for the captain has been continually making voyages in them for the last ten years, and says he has never known water enough enter to do any harm.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec.25th. - Christmas-day dawned upon us with gusts of wind, driving rain, thunder and lightning, added to which a short confused sea made our queer vessel pitch and roll very uncomfortably. About nine o\\'clock, however, it cleared up, and we then saw ahead of us the fine island of Bouru, perhaps forty or fifty miles distant, its mountains wreathed with clouds, while its lower lands were still invisible. The afternoon was fine, and the wind got round again to the west; but although this is really the west monsoon, there is no regularity or steadiness about it, calms and breezes from every point of the compass continually occurring. The captain, though nominally a Protestant, seemed to have no idea of Christmas-day as a festival. Our dinner was of rice and curry as usual, and an extra glass of wine was all I could do to celebrate it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 26th. - Fine view of the mountains of Bouru, which we have now approached considerably. Our crew seem rather a clumsy lot. They do not walk the deck with the easy swing of English sailors, but hesitate and stagger like landsmen. In the night the lower boom of our mainsail broke, and they were all the morning repairing it. It consisted of two bamboos lashed together, thick end to thin, and was about seventy feet long. The rigging and arrangement of these praus contrasts strangely with that of European vessels, in which the various ropes and spars, though much more numerous, are placed so as not to interfere with each other\\'s action. Here the case is quite different; for though there are no shrouds or stays to complicate the matter, yet scarcely anything can be done without first clearing something else out of the way. The large sails cannot be shifted round to go on the other tack without first hauling down the jibs, and the booms of the fore and aft sails have to be lowered and completely detached to perform the same operation. Then there are always a lot of ropes foul of each other, and all the sails can never be set (though they are so few) without a good part of their surface having the wind kept out of them by others. Yet praus are much liked even by those who have had European vessels, because of their cheapness both in first cost and in keeping up; almost all repairs can be done by the crew, and very few European stores are required.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 28th. - This day we saw the Banda group, the volcano first appearing,--a perfect cone, having very much the outline of the Egyptian pyramids, and looking almost as regular. In the evening the smoke rested over its summit like a small stationary cloud. This was my first view of an active volcano, but pictures and panoramas have so impressed such things on one\\'s mind, that when we at length behold them they seem nothing extraordinary.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 30th. - Passed the island of Teor, and a group near it, which are very incorrectly marked on the charts. Flying-fish were numerous to-day. It is a smaller species than that of the Atlantic, and more active and elegant in its motions. As they skim along the surface they turn on their sides, so as fully to display their beautiful fins, taking a flight of about a hundred yards, rising and falling in n most graceful manner. At a little distance they exactly resemble swallows, and no one who sees them can doubt that they really do fly, not merely descend in an oblique direction from the height they gain by their first spring. In the evening an aquatic bird, a species of booby (Sula fiber.) rested on our hen-coop, and was caught by the neck by one of my boys.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 31st. - At daybreak the Ké Islands (pronounced Kay) were in sight, where we are to stay a few days. About noon we rounded the northern point, and endeavoured to coast along to the anchorage; but being now on the leeward side of the island, the wind came in violent irregular gusts, and then leaving us altogether, we were carried back by a strong current. Just then two boats-load of natives appeared, and our owner having agreed with them to tow us into harbour, they tried to do so, assisted by our own boat, but could make no way. We were therefore obliged to anchor in a very dangerous place on a rocky bottom, and we were engaged till nearly dark getting hawsers secured to some rocks under water. The coast of Ké along which we had passed was very picturesque. Light coloured limestone rocks rose abruptly from the water to the height of several hundred feet, everywhere broken into jutting peaks and pinnacles, weather-worn into sharp points and honeycombed surfaces, and clothed throughout with a most varied and luxuriant vegetation. The cliffs above the sea offered to our view screw-pines and arborescent Liliaceae of strange forms, mingled with shrubs and creepers; while the higher slopes supported a dense growth of forest trees. Here and there little bays and inlets presented beaches of dazzling whiteness. The water was transparent as crystal, and tinged the rock-strewn slope which plunged steeply into its unfathomable depths with colours varying from emerald to lapis-lazuli. The sea was calm as a lake, and the glorious sun of the tropics threw a flood of golden light over all. The scene was to me inexpressibly delightful. I was in a new world, and could dream of the wonderful productions hid in those rocky forests, and in those azure abysses. But few European feet had ever trodden the shores I gazed upon its plants, and animals, and men were alike almost unknown, and I could not help speculating on what my wanderings there for a few days might bring to light.\\nTHE KÉ ISLANDS\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(JANUARY 1857)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0THE native boats that had come to meet us were three or four in number, containing in all about fifty men.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0They were long canoes, with the bow and stern rising up into a beak six or night feet high, decorated with shells and waving plumes of cassowaries hair. I now had my first view of Papuans in their own country, and in less than five minutes was convinced that the opinion already arrived at by the examination of a few Timor and New Guinea slaves was substantially correct, and that the people I now had an opportunity of comparing side by side belonged to two of the most  distinct and strongly marked races that the earth contains. Had I been blind, I could have been certain that these islanders were not Malays. The loud, rapid, eager tones, the incessant motion, the intense vital activity manifested in speech and action, are the very antipodes of the quiet, unimpulsive, unanimated Malay These Ké men came up singing and shouting, dipping their paddles deep in the water and throwing up clouds of spray; as they approached nearer they stood up in their canoes and increased their noise and gesticulations; and on coming alongside, without asking leave, and without a moment\\'s hesitation, the greater part of them scrambled up on our deck just as if they were come to take possession of a captured vessel. Then commenced a scene of indescribable confusion. These forty black, naked, mop-headed savages seemed intoxicated with joy and excitement. Not one of them could remain still for a moment. Every individual of our crew was in turn surrounded and examined, asked for tobacco or arrack, grinned at and deserted for another. All talked at once, and our captain was regularly mobbed by the chief men, who wanted to be employed to tow us in, and who begged vociferously to be paid in advance. A few presents of tobacco made their eyes glisten; they would express their satisfaction by grins and shouts, by rolling on deck, or by a headlong leap overboard. Schoolboys on an unexpected holiday, Irishmen at a fair, or mid-shipmen on shore, would give but a faint idea of the exuberant animal enjoyment of these people.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under similar circumstances Malays could not behave as these Papuans did. If they came on board a vessel (after asking permission), not a word would be at first spoken, except a few compliments, and only after some time, and very cautiously, world any approach be made to business. One would speak at a time, with a low voice and great deliberation, and the mode of making a bargain would be by quietly refusing all your offers, or even going away without saying another word about the matter, unless advanced your price to what they were willing to accept. Our crew, many of whom had not made the voyage before, seemed quite scandalized at such unprecedented bad manners, and only very gradually made any approach to fraternization with the black fellows. They reminded me of a party of demure and well-behaved children suddenly broken in upon by a lot of wild romping, riotous boys, whose conduct seems most extraordinary and very naughty. These moral features are more striking and more conclusive of absolute diversity than oven the physical contrast presented by the two races, though that is sufficiently remarkable. The sooty blackness of the skin, the mop-like head of frizzly hair, and, most important of all, the marked form of countenance of quite a different type from that of the Malay, are what we cannot believe to result from mere climatal or other modifying influences on one and the same race. The Malay face is of the Mongolian type, broad and somewhat flat. The brows are depressed, the mouth wide, but not projecting, and the nose small and well formed but for the great dilatation of the nostrils. The face is smooth, and rarely develops the trace of a beard; the hair black, coarse, and perfectly straight. The Papuan, on the other hand, has a face which we may say is compressed and projecting. The brows are protuberant and overhanging, the mouth large and prominent, while the nose is very large, the apex elongated downwards, the ridge thick, and the nostrils large. It is an obtrusive and remarkable feature in the countenance, the very reverse of what obtains in the Malay face. The twisted beard and frizzly hair complete this remarkable contrast. Hero then I had reached a new world, inhabited by a strange people. Between the Malayan tribes, among whom I had for some years been living, and the Papuan races, whose country I had now entered, we may fairly say that there is as much difference, both moral and physical, as between the red Indians of South America and the negroes of Guinea on the opposite side of the Atlantic.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Jan. 1st, 1857. - This has been a day of thorough enjoyment. I have wandered in the forests of an island rarely seen by Europeans. Before daybreak we left our anchorage, and in an hour reached the village of Har, where we were to stay three or four days. The range of hills here receded so as to form a small bay, and they were broken up into peaks and hummocks with intervening flats and hollows. A broad beach of the whitest sand lined the inner part of the bay, backed by a mass of cocoa-nut palms, among which the huts were concealed, and surmounted by a dense and varied growth of timber. Canoes and boats of various sizes were drawn up on the beach and one or two idlers, with a few children and a dog, gazed at our prau as we came to an anchor.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When we went on shore the first thing that attracted us was a large and well-constructed shed, under which a long boat was being built, while others in various stages of completion were placed at intervals along the beach.  Our captain, who wanted two of moderate size for the trade among the islands at Aru, immediately began bargaining for them, and in a short tine had arranged the nuns number of brass guns, gongs, sarongs, handkerchiefs, axes, white plates, tobacco, and arrack, which he was to give for a hair which could be got ready in four days. We then went to the village, which consisted only of three or four huts, situated immediately above the beach on an irregular rocky piece of ground overshadowed with cocoa-nuts, palms, bananas, and other fruit trees. The houses were very rude, black, and half rotten, raised a few feet on posts with low sides of bamboo or planks, and high thatched roofs. They had small doors and no windows, an opening under the projecting gables letting the smoke out and a little light in. The floors were of strips of bamboo, thin, slippery, and elastic, and so weak that my feet were in danger of plunging through at every step. Native boxes of pandanus-leaves and slabs of palm pith, very neatly constructed, mats of the same, jars and cooking pots of native pottery, and a few European plates and basins, were the whole furniture, and the interior was throughout dark and smoke-blackened, and dismal in the extreme.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Accompanied by Ali and Baderoon, I now attempted to make some explorations, and we were followed by a train of boys eager to see what we were going to do. The most trodden path from the beach led us into a shady hollow, where the trees were of immense height and the undergrowth scanty. From the summits of these trees came at intervals a deep booming sound, which at first puzzled us, but which we soon found to proceed from some large pigeons. My boys shot at them, and after one or two misses, brought one down. It was a magnificent bird twenty inches long, of a bluish white colour, with the back wings and tail intense metallic green, with golden, blue, and violet reflexions, the feet coral red, and the eyes golden yellow. It is a rare species, which I have named Carpophaga concinna, and is found only in a few small islands, where, however, it abounds. It is the same species which in the island of Banda is called the nutmeg-pigeon, from its habit of devouring the fruits, the seed or nutmeg being thrown up entire and uninjured. Though these pigeons have a narrow beak, yet their jaws and throat are so extensible that they can swallow fruits of very large size. I had before shot a species much smaller than this one, which had a number of hard globular palm-fruits in its crop, each more than an inch in diameter.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A little further the path divided into two, one leading along the beach, and across mangrove and sago swamps the other rising to cultivated grounds. We therefore returned, and taking a fresh departure from the village, endeavoured to ascend the hills and penetrate into the interior. The path, however, was a most trying one. Where there was earth, it was a deposit of reddish clay overlying the rock, and was worn so smooth by the attrition of naked feet that my shoes could obtain no hold on the sloping surface. A little farther we came to the bare rock, and this was worse, for it was so rugged and broken, and so honeycombed and weatherworn into sharp points and angles, that my boys, who had gone barefooted all their lives, could not stand it. Their feet began to bleed, and I saw that if I did not want them completely lamed it would be wise to turn lack. My own shoes, which were rather thin, were but a poor protection, and would soon have been cut to pieces; yet our little naked guides tripped along with the greatest ease and unconcern, and seemed much astonished at our effeminacy in not being able to take a walk which to them was a perfectly agreeable one. During the rest of our stay in the island we were obliged to confine ourselves to the vicinity of the shore and the cultivated grounds, and those more level portions of the forest where a little soil had accumulated and the rock had been less exposed to atmospheric action.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The island of Ké (pronounced exactly as the letter K, but erroneously spelt in our maps Key or Ki) is long and narrow, running in a north and south direction, and consists almost entirely of rock and mountain. It is everywhere covered with luxuriant forests, and in its bays and inlets the sand is of dazzling whiteness, resulting from the decomposition of the coralline limestone of which it is entirely composed. In all the little swampy inlets and valleys sago trees abound, and these supply the main subsistence of the natives, who grow no rice, and have scarcely any other cultivated products but cocoa-nuts, plantains, and yams. From the cocoa-nuts, which surround every hut, and which thrive exceedingly on the porous limestone soil and under the influence of salt breezes, oil is made which is sold at a good price to the Aru traders, who all touch here to lay in their stuck of this article, as well as to purchase boats and native crockery. Wooden bowls, pans, and trays are also largely made here, hewn out of solid blocks of wood with knife and adze; and these are carried to all parts of the Moluccas. But the art in which the natives of Ké pre-eminently excel is that of boat building. Their forests supply abundance of fine timber, though, probably not more so than many other islands, and from some unknown causes these remote savages have come to excel in what seems a very difficult art. Their small canoes are beautifully formed, broad and low in the centre, but rising at each end, where they terminate in high-pointed beaks more or less carved, and ornamented with a plume of feathers. They are not hollowed out of a tree, but are regularly built of planks running from ego to end, and so accurately fitted that it is often difficult to find a place where a knife-blade can be inserted between the joints. The larger ones are from 20 to 30 tons burthen, and are finished ready for sea without a nail or particle of iron being used, and with no other tools than axe, adze, and auger. These vessels are handsome to look at, good sailers, and admirable sea-boats, and will make long voyages with perfect safety, traversing the whole Archipelago from New Guinea to Singapore in seas which, as every one who has sailed much in them can testify, are not so smooth and tempest-free as word- painting travellers love to represent them.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The forests of Ké produce magnificent timber, tall, straight, and durable, of various qualities, some of which are said to be superior to the best Indian teak. To make each pair of planks used in the construction of the larger boats an entire tree is consumed. It is felled, often miles away from the shore, cut across to the proper length, and then hewn longitudinally into two equal portions. Each of these forms a plank by cutting down with the axe to a uniform thickness of three or four inches, leaving at first a solid block at each end to prevent splitting. Along the centre of each plank a series of projecting pieces are left, standing up three or four inches, about the same width, and a foot long; these are of great importance in the construction of the vessel. When a sufficient number of planks have been made, they are laboriously dragged through the forest by three or four men each to the beach, where the boat is to be built. A foundation piece, broad in the middle and rising considerably at each end, is first laid on blocks and properly shored up. The edges of this are worked true and smooth with the adze, and a plank, properly curved and tapering at each end, is held firmly up against it, while a line is struck along it which allows it to be cut so as to fit exactly. A series of auger holes, about as large as one\\'s finger, are then bored along the opposite edges, and pins of very hard wood are fitted to these, so that the two planks are held firmly, and can be driven into the closest contact; and difficult as this seems to do without any other aid than rude practical skill in forming each edge to the true corresponding curves, and in poring the holes so as exactly to match both in position and direction, yet so well is it done that the best European shipwright cannot produce sounder or closer- fitting joints. The boat is built up in this way by fitting plank to plank till the proper height and width are obtained. We have now a skin held together entirely by the hardwood pins connecting the edges of the planks, very strong and elastic, but having nothing but the adhesion of these pins to prevent the planks gaping. In the smaller boats seats, in the larger ones cross- beams, are now fixed. They are sprung into slight notches cut to receive them, and are further secured to the projecting pieces of the plank below by a strong lashing of rattan. Ribs are now formed of single pieces of tough wood chosen and trimmed so as exactly to fit on to the projections from each plank, being slightly notched to receive them, and securely bound to them by rattans passed through a hole in each projecting piece close to the surface of the plank. The ends are closed against the vertical prow and stern posts, and further secured with pegs and rattans, and then the boat is complete; and when fitted with rudders, masts, and thatched covering, is ready to do battle with, the waves. A careful consideration of the principle of this mode of construction, and allowing for the strength and binding qualities of rattan (which resembles in these respects wire rather than cordage), makes me believe that a vessel carefully built in this manner is actually stronger and safer than one fastened in the ordinary way with nails.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0During our stay here we were all very busy. Our captain was daily superintending the completion of his two small praus. All day long native boats were coming with fish, cocoa-nuts, parrots and lories, earthen pans, sirip leaf, wooden bowls, and trays, &c. &e., which every one of the fifty inhabitants of our prau seemed to be buying on his own account, till all available and most unavailable space of our vessel was occupied with these miscellaneous articles: for every man on board a prau considers himself at liberty to trade, and to carry with him whatever he can afford to buy.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Money is unknown and valueless here--knives, cloth, and arrack forming the only medium of exchange, with tobacco for small coin. Every transaction is the subject of a special bargain, and the cause of much talking. It is absolutely necessary to offer very little, as the natives are never satisfied till you add a little more. They are then far better pleased than if you had given them twice the amount at first and refused to increase it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I, too, was doing a little business, having persuaded some of the natives to collect insects for me; and when they really found that I gave them most fragrant tobacco for worthless black and green beetles, I soon had scores of visitors, men, women, and children, bringing bamboos full of creeping things, which, alas! too frequently had eaten each other into fragments during the tedium of a day\\'s confinement. Of one grand new beetle, glittering with ruby and emerald tints, I got a large quantity, having first detected one of its wing-cases ornamenting the outside of a native\\'s tobacco pouch. It was quite a new species, and had not been found elsewhere than on this little island. It is one of the Buprestidae, and has been named Cyphogastra calepyga.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Each morning after an early breakfast I wandered by myself into the forest, where I found delightful occupation in capturing the large and handsome butterflies, which were tolerably abundant, and most of them new to me; for I was now upon the confines of the Moluccas and New Guinea,--a region the productions of which were then among the most precious and rare in the cabinets of Europe. Here my eyes were feasted for the first time with splendid scarlet lories on the wing, as well as by the sight of that most imperial butterfly, the \"Priamus \"of collectors, or a closely allied species, but flying so high that I did not succeed in capturing a specimen. One of them was brought me in a bamboo, bored up with a lot of beetles, and of course torn to pieces. The principal drawback of the place for a collector is the want of good paths, and the dreadfully rugged character of the surface, requiring the attention to be so continually directed to securing a footing, as to make it very difficult to capture active winged things, who pass out of reach while one is glancing to see that the next step may not plunge one into a chasm or over a precipice. Another inconvenience is that there are no running streams, the rock being of so porous a nature that the surface- water everywhere penetrates its fissures; at least such is the character of the neighbourhood we visited, the only water being small springs trickling out close to the sea-beach.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the forests of Ke, arboreal Liliaceae and Pandanaceae abound, and give a character to the vegetation in the more exposed rocky places. Flowers were scarce, and there were not many orchids, but I noticed the fine white butterfly-orchis, Phalaenopsis grandiflora, or a species closely allied to it. The freshness and vigour of the vegetation was very pleasing, and on such an arid rocky surface was a sure indication of a perpetually humid climate. Tall clean trunks, many of them buttressed, and immense trees of the fig family, with aerial roots stretching out and interlacing and matted together for fifty or a hundred feet above the ground, were the characteristic features; and there was an absence of thorny shrubs and prickly rattans, which would have made these wilds very pleasant to roam in, had it not been for the sharp honeycombed rocks already alluded to. In damp places a fine undergrowth of broadleaved herbaceous plants was found, about which swarmed little green lizards, with tails of the most \"heavenly blue,\" twisting in and out among the stalks and foliage so actively that I often caught glimpses of their tails only, when they startled me by their resemblance to small snakes. Almost the only sounds in these primeval woods proceeded from two birds, the red lories, who utter shrill screams like most of the parrot tribe, and the large green nutmeg-pigeon, whose voice is either a loud and deep boom, like two notes struck upon a very large gong, or sometimes a harsh toad-like croak, altogether peculiar and remarkable. Only two quadrupeds are said by the natives to inhabit the island--a wild pig and a Cuscus, or Eastern opossum, of neither of which could I obtain specimens.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The insects were more abundant, and very interesting. Of butterflies I caught thirty-five species, most of them new to me, and many quite unknown in European collections. Among them was the fine yellow and black Papilio euchenor, of which but few specimens had been previously captured, and several other handsome butterflies of large size, as well as some beautiful little \"blues,\" and some brilliant dayflying moths. The beetle tribe were less abundant, yet I obtained some very fine and rare species. On the leaves of a slender shrub in an old clearing I found several fine blue and black beetles of the genus Eupholus, which almost rival in beauty- the diamond beetles of South America. Some cocoa-nut palms in blossom on the beach were frequented by a fine green floral beetle (Lomaptera which, when the flowers were shaken, flew off like a small swarm of bees. I got one of our crew to climb up the tree, and he brought me a good number in his hand; and seeing they were valuable, I sent him up again with my net to shake the flowers into, and thus secured a large quantity. My best capture, however, was the superb insect of the Buprestis family, already mentioned as having been obtained from the natives, who told me they found it in rotten trees in the mountains.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the forest itself the only common and conspicuous coleoptera were two tiger beetles. One, Therates labiata, was much larger than our green tiger beetle, of a purple black colour, with green metallic glosses, and the broad upper lip of a bright yellow. It was always found upon foliage, generally of broad-leaned herbaceous plants, and in damp and gloomy situations, taking frequent short flights from leaf to leaf, and preserving an alert attitude, as if always looking out for its prey. Its vicinity could be immediately ascertained, often before it was seen, by a very pleasant odour, like otto of roses, which it seems to emit continually, and which may probably be attractive to the small insects on which it feeds. The other, Tricondyla aptera, is one of the most curious forms in the family of the Cicindelidae, and is almost exclusively confined to the Malay islands. In shape it resembles a very large ant, more than an inch long, and of a purple black colour. Like an ant also it is wingless, and is generally found ascending trees, passing around the trunks in a spiral direction when approached, to avoid capture, so that it requires a sudden run and active fingers to secure a specimen. This species emits the usual fetid odour of the ground beetles. My collections during our four days\\' stay at Ké were as follow:-- Birds, 13 species; insects, 194 species; and 3 kinds of land- shells.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There are two kinds of people inhabiting these islands--the indigenes, who have the Papuan characters strongly marked, and who are pagans; and a mixed race, who are nominally Mahometans, and wear cotton clothing, while the former use only a waist cloth of cotton or bark. These Mahometans are said to have been driven out of Banda by the early European settlers. They were probably a brown race, more allied to the Malays, and their mixed descendants here exhibit great variations of colour, hair, and features, graduating between the Malay and Papuan types. It is interesting to observe the influence of the early Portuguese trade with these countries in the words of their language, which still remain in use even among these remote and savage islanders. \"Lenco\" for handkerchief, and \"faca\" for knife, are here used to the exclusion of the proper Malay terms. The Portuguese and Spaniards were truly wonderful conquerors and colonizers. They effected more rapid changes in the countries they conquered than any other nations of modern times, resembling the Romans in their power of impressing their own language, religion, and manners on rode and barbarous tribes.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The striking contrast of character between these people and the Malays is exemplified in many little traits. One day when I was rambling in the forest, an old man stopped to look at me catching an insect. He stood very quiet till I had pinned and put it away in my collecting box, when he could contain himself no longer, but bent almost double, and enjoyed a hearty roar of laughter. Every one will recognise this as a true negro trait. A Malay would have stared, and asked with a tone of bewilderment what I was doing, for it is but little in his nature to laugh, never heartily, and still less at or in the presence of a stranger, to whom, however, his disdainful glances or whispered remarks are less agreeable than the most boisterous open expression of merriment. The women here were not so much frightened at strangers, or made to keep themselves so much secluded as among the Malay races; the children were more merry and had the \"nigger grin,\" while the noisy confusion of tongues among the men, and their excitement on very ordinary occasions, are altogether removed from the general taciturnity and reserve of the Malay.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The language of the Ké people consists of words of one, two, or three syllables in about equal proportions, and has many aspirated and a few guttural sounds. The different villages have slight differences of dialect, but they are mutually intelligible, and, except in words that have evidently been introduced during a long-continued commercial intercourse, seem to have no affinity whatever with the Malay languages.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Jan. 6th. - The small boats being finished, we sailed for Aru at 4 P.M., and as we left the shores of Ké had a line view of its rugged and mountainous character; ranges of hills, three or four thousand feet high, stretching southwards as far as the eye could reach, everywhere covered with a lofty, dense, and unbroken forest. We had very light winds, and it therefore took us thirty hours to make the passage of sixty miles to the low, or flat, but equally forest-covered Aru Islands, where we anchored in the harbour of Dobbo at nine in the evening of the next day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My first voyage in a prau being thus satisfactorily terminated, I must, before taking leave of it for some months, bear testimony to the merits of the queer old-world vessel. Setting aside all ideas of danger, which is probably, after all, not more than in any other craft, I must declare that I have never, either before or since, made a twenty days\\' voyage so pleasantly, or perhaps, more correctly speaking, with so little discomfort. This I attribute chiefly to having my small cabin on deck, and entirely to myself, to having my own servants to wait upon me, and to the absence of all those marine-store smells of paint, pitch, tallow, and new cordage, which are to me insupportable. Something is also to be put down to freedom from all restraint of dress, hours of meals, &c., and to the civility and obliging disposition of the captain. I had agreed to have my meals with him, but whenever I wished it I had them in my own berth, and at what hours I felt inclined. The crew were all civil and good-tempered, and with very little discipline everything went on smoothly, and the vessel was kept very clean and in pretty good order, so that on the whole I was much delighted with the trip, and was inclined to rate the luxuries of the semi-barbarous prau as surpassing those of the most magnificent screw-steamer, that highest result of our civilisation.\\nNATIVES OF ARU SHOOTING THE GREAT BIRD OF PARADISE\\nTHE ARU ISLANDS - RESIDENCE IN DOBBO\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(JANUARY TO MARCH  1857)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 8th of January, 1857, I landed at Dobbo, the trading settlement of the Bugis and Chinese, who annually visit the Aru Islands. It is situated on the small island of Wamma, upon a spit of sand which projects out to the north, and is just wide enough to contain three rows of houses. Though at first sight a most strange and desolate-looking place to build a village on, it has many advantages. There is a clear entrance from the west among the coral reefs that border the land, and there is good anchorage for vessels, on one side of the village or the other, in both the east and west monsoons. Being fully exposed to the sea-breezes in three directions it is healthy, and the soft sandy heath offers great facilities for hauling up the praus, in order to secure them from sea-worms and prepare them for the homeward voyage. At its southern extremity the sand-bank merges in the beach of the island, and is backed by a luxuriant growth of lofty forest. The houses are of various sizes, but are all built after one pattern, being merely large thatched sheds, a small portion of which, next the entrance, is used as a dwelling, while the rest is parted oft; and often divided by one or two floors, in order better to stow away merchandise and native produce.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As we had arrived early in the season, most of the houses were empty, and the place looked desolate in the extreme--the whole of the inhabitants who received us on our landing amounting to about half-a-dozen Bugis and Chinese. Our captain, Herr Warzbergen, had promised to obtain a house for me, but unforeseen difficulties presented themselves. One which was to let had no roof; and the owner, who was building it on speculation, could not promise to finish it in less than a month. Another, of which the owner was dead, and which I might therefore take undisputed possession of as the first comer, wanted considerable repairs, and no one could be found to do the work, although about four times its value was offered. The captain, therefore, recommended me to take possession of a pretty good house near his own, whose owner was not expected for some weeks; and as I was anxious to be on shore, I immediately had it cleared out, and by evening had all my things housed, and was regularly installed as an inhabitant of Dobbo. I had brought with me a cane chair, and a few light boards, which were soon rigged up into a table and shelves. A broad bamboo bench served as sofa and bedstead, my boxes were conveniently arranged, my mats spread on the floor, a window cut in the palm-leaf wall to light my table, and though the place was as miserable and gloomy a shed as could be imagined, I felt as contented as if I had obtained a well-furnished mansion, and looked forward to a month\\'s residence in it with unmixed satisfaction.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next morning, after an early breakfast, I set off to explore the virgin forests of Aru, anxious to set my mind at rest as to the treasures they were likely to yield, and the probable success of my long-meditated expedition. A little native imp was our guide, seduced by the gift of a German knife, value three- halfpence, and my Macassar boy Baderoon brought his chopper to clear the path if necessary.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We had to walk about half a mile along the beach, the ground behind the village being mostly swampy, and then turned into the forest along a path which leads to the native village of Wamma, about three miles off on the other side of the island. The path was a narrow one, and very little used, often swampy and obstructed by fallen trees, so that after about a mile we lost it altogether, our guide having turned back, and we were obliged to follow his example. In the meantime, however, I had not been idle, and my day\\'s captures determined the success of my journey in an entomological point of view. I had taken about thirty species of butterflies, more than I had ever captured in a day since leaving the prolific banks of the Amazon, and among them were many most rare and beautiful insects, hitherto only known by a few specimens from New Guinea. The large and handsome spectre butterfly, Hestia durvillei; the pale-winged peacock butterfly, Drusilla catops; and the most brilliant and wonderful of the clear-winged moths, Cocytia durvillei, were especially interesting, as well, as several little \"blues,\" equalling in brilliancy and beauty anything the butterfly world can produce. In the other groups of insects I was not so successful, but this was not to be wondered at in a mere exploring ramble, when only what is most conspicuous and novel attracts the attention. Several pretty beetles, a superb \"bug,\" and a few nice land- shells were obtained, and I returned in the afternoon well satisfied with my first trial of the promised land.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next two days were so wet and windy that there was no going out; but on the succeeding one the sun shone brightly, and I had the good fortune to capture one of the most magnificent insects the world contains, the great bird-winged butterfly, Ornithoptera Poseidon. I trembled with excitement as I saw it coming majestically towards me, and could hardly believe I had really succeeded in my stroke till I had taken it out of the net and was gazing, lost in admiration, at the velvet black and brilliant green of its wings, seven inches across, its bolder body, and crimson breast. It is true I had seen similar insects in cabinets at home, but it is quite another thing to capture such oneself-to feel it struggling between one\\'s fingers, and to gaze upon its fresh and living beauty, a bright gem shirring out amid the silent gloom of a dark and tangled forest. The village of Dobbo held that evening at least one contented man.\\nDOBBO, IN THE TRADING SEASON\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Jan. 26th. -- Having now been here a fortnight, I began to understand a little of the place and its peculiarities. Praus continually arrived, and the merchant population increased almost daily. Every two or three days a fresh house was opened, and the necessary repairs made. In every direction men were bringing in poles, bamboos, rattans, and the leaves of the nipa palm to construct or repair the walls, thatch, doors, and shutters of their houses, which they do with great celerity. Some of the arrivals were Macassar men or Bugis, but more from the small island of Goram, at the east end of Ceram, whose inhabitants are the petty traders of the far East. Then the natives of Aru come in from the other side of the islands (called here \"blakang tana,\" or \"back of the country\") with the produce they have collected during the preceding six months, and which they now sell to the traders, to some of whom they are most likely in debt.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Almost all, or I may safely say all, the new arrivals pay me a visit, to see with their own eyes the unheard-of phenomenon of a person come to stay at Dobbo who does not trade! They have their own ideas of the uses that may possibly be made of stuffed birds, beetles, and shells which are not the right shells--that is, \"mother-of-pearl.\" They every day bring me dead and broken shells, such as l can pick up by hundreds on the beach, and seem quite puzzled and distressed when I decline them. If, however, there are any snail shells among a lot, I take them, and ask for more--a principle of selection so utterly unintelligible to them, that they give it up in despair, or solve the problem by imputing hidden medical virtue to those which they see me preserve so carefully.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0These traders are all of the Malay race, or a mixture of which Malay is the chef ingredient, with the exception of a few Chinese. The natives of Aru, on the other hand, are, Papuans, with black or sooty brown skims, woolly or frizzly hair, thick- ridged prominent noses, and rather slender limbs. Most of them wear nothing but a waist-cloth, and a few of them may be seen all day long wandering about the half-deserted streets of Dobbo offering their little bit of merchandise for sale.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Living in a trader\\'s house everything is brought to me as well as to the rest,--bundles of smoked tripang, or \"beche de mer,\" looking like sausages which have been rolled in mud and then thrown up the chimney; dried sharks\\' fins, mother-of-pearl shells, as well as birds of Paradise, which, however, are so dirty and so badly preserved that I have as yet found no specimens worth purchasing. When I hardly look at the articles, and make no offer for them, they seem incredulous, and, as if fearing they have misunderstood me, again offer them, and declare what they want in return--knives, or tobacco, or sago, or handkerchiefs. I then have to endeavour to explain, through any interpreter who may be at hand, that neither tripang nor pearl oyster shells have any charms for me, and that I even decline to speculate in tortoiseshell, but that anything eatable I will buy- -fish, or turtle, or vegetables of any sort. Almost the only food, however, that we can obtain with any regularity, are fish and cockles of very good quality, and to supply our daily wants it is absolutely necessary to be always provided with four articles--tobacco, knives, sago-cakes, and Dutch copper doits-- because when the particular thing asked for is not forthcoming, the fish pass on to the next house, and we may go that day without a dinner. It is curious to see the baskets and buckets used here. The cockles are brought in large volute shells, probably the Cymbium ducale, while gigantic helmet-shells, a species of Cassis, suspended by a rattan handle, form the vessels in which fresh water is daily carried past my door. It is painful to a naturalist to see these splendid shells with their inner whorls ruthlessly broken away to fit them for their ignoble use.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My collections, however, got on but slowly, owing to the unexpectedly bad weather, violent winds with heavy showers having been so continuous as only to give me four good collecting days out of the first sixteen I spent here. Yet enough had been collected to show me that with time and fine weather I might expect to do something good. From the natives I obtained some very fine insects and a few pretty land-shells; and of the small number of birds yet shot more than half were known New Guinea species, and therefore certainly rare in European collections, while the remainder were probably new. In one respect my hopes seemed doomed to be disappointed. I had anticipated the pleasure of myself preparing fine specimens of the Birds of Paradise, but I now learnt that they are all at this season out of plumage, and that it is in September and October that they have the long plumes of yellow silky feathers in full perfection. As all the praus return in July, I should not be able to spend that season in Aru without remaining another whole year, which was out of the question. I was informed, however, that the small red species, the \"King Bird of Paradise,\" retains its plumage at all seasons, and this I might therefore hope to get.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As I became familiar with the forest scenery of the island, (perceived it to possess some characteristic features that distinguished it from that of Borneo and Malacca, while, what is very singular and interesting, it recalled to my mind the half- forgotten impressions of the forests of Equatorial America. For example, the palms were much more abundant than I had generally found them in the East, more generally mingled with the other vegetation, more varied in form and aspect, and presenting some of those lofty and majestic smooth-stemmed, pinnate-leaved species which recall the Uauassu (Attalea speciosa) of the Amazon, but which I had hitherto rarely met with in the Malayan islands.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In animal life the immense number and variety of spiders and of lizards were circumstances that recalled the prolific regions of south America, more especially the abundance and varied colours of the little jumping spiders which abound on flowers and foliage, and are often perfect gems of beauty. The web-spinning species were also more numerous than I had ever seen them, and were a great annoyance, stretching their nets across the footpaths just about the height of my face; and the threads composing these are so strong and glutinous as to require much trouble to free oneself from them. Then their inhabitants, great yellow-spotted monsters with bodies two inches long, and legs in proportion, are not pleasant to o run one\\'s nose against while pursuing some gorgeous butterfly, or gazing aloft in search of some strange-voiced bird. I soon found it necessary not only to brush away the web, but also to destroy the spinner; for at first, having cleared the path one day, I found the next morning that the industrious insects had spread their nets again in the very same places.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The lizards were equally striking by their numbers, variety, and the situations in which they were found. The beautiful blue- tailed species so abundant in Ké was not seen here. The Aru lizards are more varied but more sombre in their colours--shades of green, grey, brown, and even black, being very frequently seen. Every shrub and herbaceous plant was alive with them, every rotten trunk or dead branch served as a station for some of these active little insect-hunters, who, I fear, to satisfy their gross appetites, destroy many gems of the insect world, which would feast the eyes and delight the heart of our more discriminating entomologists. Another curious feature of the jungle here was the multitude of sea-shells everywhere met with on the ground and high up on the branches and foliage, all inhabited by hermit- crabs, who forsake the beach to wander in the forest. I lave actually seen a spider carrying away a good-sized shell and devouring its (probably juvenile) tenant. On the beach, which I had to walls along every morning to reach the forest, these creatures swarmed by thousands. Every dead shell, from the largest to the most minute, was appropriated by them. They formed small social parties of ten or twenty around bits of stick or seaweed, but dispersed hurriedly at the sound of approaching footsteps. After a windy night, that nasty-looking Chinese delicacy the sea-slug was sometimes thrown up on the beach, which was at such times thickly strewn with some of the most beautiful shells that adorn our cabinets, along with fragments and masses of coral and strange sponges, of which I picked up more than twenty different sorts. In many cases sponge and coral are so much alike that it is only on touching them that they can be distinguished. Quantities of seaweed, too, are thrown up; but strange as it may seem, these are far less beautiful and less varied than may be found on any favourable part of our own coasts.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The natives here, even those who seem to be of pare Papuan race, were much more reserved and taciturn than those of Ke. This is probably because I only saw them as yet among strangers and in small parties, One must see the savage at home to know what he really is. Even here, however, the Papuan character sometimes breaks out. Little boys sing cheerfully as they walk along, or talk aloud to themselves (quite a negro characteristic); and try all they can, the men cannot conceal their emotions in the true Malay fashion. A number of them were one day in my house, and having a fancy to try what sort of eating tripang would be, I bought a couple, paying for them with such an extravagant quantity of tobacco that the seller saw I was a green customer. He could not, however, conceal his delight, but as he smelt the fragrant weed, and exhibited the large handful to his companions, he grinned and twisted and gave silent chuckles in a most expressive pantomime. I had often before made the same mistake in paying a Malay for some trifle. In no case, however, was his pleasure visible on his countenance--a dull and stupid hesitation only showing his surprise, which would be exhibited exactly in the same way whether he was over or under paid. These little moral traits are of the greatest interest when taken in connexion with physical features. They do not admit of the same ready explanation by external causes which is so frequently applied to the latter. Writers on the races of mankind have too often to trust to the information of travellers who pass rapidly from country to country, and thus have few opportunities of becoming acquainted with peculiarities of national character, or even of ascertaining what is really the average physical conformation of the people. Such are exceedingly apt to be deceived in places where two races have long, intermingled, by looking on intermediate forms and mixed habits as evidences of a natural transition from one race to the other, instead of an artificial mixture of two distinct peoples; and they will be the more readily led into this error if, as in the present case, writers on the subject should have been in the habit of classing these races as mere varieties of one stock, as closely related in physical conformation as from their geographical proximity one might suppose they ought to be. So far as I have yet seen, the Malay and Papuan appear to be as widely separated as any two human races that exist, being distinguished by physical, mental, and moral characteristics, all of the most marked and striking kind.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Feb 5th. -- I took advantage of a very fine calm day to pay a visit to the island of Wokan, which is about a mile from us, and forms part of the \"canna busar,\" or mainland of Aru. This is a large island, extending from north to south about a hundred miles, but so low in many parts as to be intersected by several creeks, which run completely through it, offering a passage for good- sized vessels. On the west side, where we are, there are only a few outlying islands, of which ours (Wamma) is the principal; but on the east coast are a great number of islands, extending some miles beyond the mainland, and forming the \"blakang tang,\" or \"back country,\" of the traders, being the principal seat of the pearl, tripang, and tortoiseshell fisheries. To the mainland many of the birds and animals of the country are altogether confined; the Birds of paradise, the black cockatoo, the great brush- turkey, and the cassowary, are none of them found on Wamma or any of the detached islands. I did not, however, expect in this excursion to see any decided difference in the forest or its productions, and was therefore agreeably surprised. The beach was overhung with the drooping branches of lame trees, loaded with Orchideae, ferns, and other epiphytal plants. In the forest there was more variety, some parts being dry, and with trees of a lower growth, while in others there were some of the most beautiful palms I have ever seen, with a perfectly straight, smooth, slender stem, a hundred feet high, and a crown of handsome drooping leaves. But the greatest novelty and most striking feature to my eyes were the tree-ferns, which, after seven years spent in the tropics, I now saw in perfection for the first time. All I had hitherto met with were slender species, not more than twelve feet high, and they gave not the least idea of the supreme beauty of trees bearing their elegant heads of fronds more than thirty feet in the air, like those which were plentifully scattered about this forest. There is nothing in tropical vegetation so perfectly beautiful.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My boys shot five sorts of birds, none of which we had obtained during a month\\'s shooting in Wamma. Two were very pretty flycatchers, already known from New Guinea; one of them (Monarcha chrysomela), of brilliant black and bright orange colours, is by some authors considered to be the most beautiful of all flycatchers; the other is pure white and velvety black, with a broad fleshy ring round the eye of are azure blue colour; it is named the \"spectacled flycatcher\" (Monarcha telescopthalma), and was first found in New Guinea, along with the other, by the French naturalists during the voyage of the discovery-ship Coquille.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Feb. 18th. -- Before leaving Macassar, I had written to the Governor of Amboyna requesting him to assist me with the native chiefs of Aru. I now received by a vessel which had arrived from Amboyna a very polite answer informing me that orders had been sent to give me every assistance that I might require; and I was just congratulating myself on being at length able to get a boat and men to go to the mainland and explore the interior, when a sudden check carne in the form of a piratical incursion. A small prau arrived which had been attacked by pirates and had a man wounded. They were said to have five boats, but more were expected to be behind and the traders were all in consternation, fearing that their small vessels sent trading to the \"blakang tana\" would be plundered. The Aru natives were of course  dreadfully alarmed, as these marauders attack their villages, burn and murder, and carry away women and children for slaves. Not a man will stir from his village for some time, and I must remain still a prisoner in Dobbo. The Governor of Amboyna, out of pure kindness, has told the chiefs that they are to be responsible for my safety, so that they have au excellent excuse for refusing to stir.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Several praus went out in search of the pirates, sentinels were appointed, and watch-fires lighted on the beach to guard against the possibility of a night attack, though it was hardly thought they would be bold enough to attempt to plunder Dobbo. The next day the praus returned, and we had positive information that these scourges of the Eastern seas were really among us. One of Herr Warzbergen\\'s small praus also arrived in a sad plight. It had been attacked six days before, just as it was returning, from the \"blakang tana.\" The crew escaped in their small boat and hid in the jungle, while the pirates came up and plundered the vessel. They took away everything but the cargo of mother-of- pearl shell, which was too bulky for them. All the clothes and boxes of the men, and the sails and cordage of the prau, were cleared off. They had four large war boats, and fired a volley of musketry as they came up, and sent off their small boats to the attack. After they had left, our men observed from their concealment that three had stayed behind with a small boat; and being driven to desperation by the sight of the plundering, one brave fellow swam off armed only with his parang, or chopping- knife, and coming on them unawares made a desperate attack, killing one and wounding the other two, receiving himself numbers of slight wounds, and then swimming off again when almost exhausted. Two other prams were also plundered, and the crew of one of them murdered to a man. They are said to be Sooloo pirates, but have Bugis among them. On their way here they have devastated one of the small islands east of Ceram. It is now eleven years since they have visited Aru, and by thus making their attacks at long and uncertain intervals the alarm dies away, and they find a population for the most part unarmed and unsuspicious of danger. None of the small trading vessels now carry arms, though they did so for a year or two after the last attack, which was just the time when there was the least occasion for it. A week later one of the smaller pirate boats was captured in the \"blakang tana.\" Seven men were killed and three taken prisoners. The larger vessels have been often seen but cannot be caught, as they have very strong crews, and can always escape by rowing out to sea in the eye of the wind, returning at night. They will thus remain among the innumerable islands and channels, till the change of the monsoon enables them to sail westward.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0March 9th. -- For four or five days we have had a continual gale of wind, with occasional gusts of great fury, which seem as if they would send Dobbo into the sea. Rain accompanies it almost every alternate hour, so that it is not a pleasant time. During such weather I can do little, but am busy getting ready a boat I have purchased, for an excursion into the interior. There is immense difficulty about men, but I believe the \"Orang-kaya,\" or head man of Wamma,  will accompany me to see that I don\\'t run into danger.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Having become quite an old inhabitant of Dobbo, I will endeavour to sketch the sights and sounds that pervade it, and the manners and customs of its inhabitants. The place is now pretty full, and the streets present a far more cheerful aspect than when we first arrived. Every house is a store, where the natives barter their produce for what they are most in need of. Knives, choppers, swords, guns, tobacco, gambier, plates, basins, handkerchiefs, sarongs, calicoes, and arrack, are the principal articles wanted by the natives; but some of the stores contain also tea, coffee, sugar, wine, biscuits, &c., for the supply of the traders; and others are full of fancy goods, china ornaments, looking-glasses, razors, umbrellas, pipes, and purses, which take the fancy of the wealthier natives. Every fine day mats are spread before the doors and the tripang is put out to dry, as well as sugar, salt, biscuit, tea, cloths, and other things that get injured by an excessively moist atmosphere. In the morning and evening, spruce Chinamen stroll about or chat at each other\\'s doors, in blue trousers, white jacket, and a queue into which red silk is plaited till it reaches almost to their heels. An old Bugis hadji regularly takes an evening stroll in all the dignity of flowing green silk robe and gay turban, followed by two small boys carrying his sirih and betel boxes.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In every vacant space new houses are being built, and all sorts of odd little cooking-sheds are erected against the old ones, while in some out-of-the-way corners, massive log pigsties are tenanted by growing porkers; for how can the Chinamen exist six months without one feast of pig?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here and there are stalls where bananas are sold, and every morning two little boys go about with trays of sweet rice and crated cocoa-nut, fried fish, or fried plantains; and whichever it may be, they have but one cry, and that is \"Chocolat-t--t!\" This must be a Spanish or Portuguese cry, handed down for centuries, while its meaning has been lost. The Bugis sailors, while hoisting the main sail, cry out, \"Vela a vela,-- vela, vela, vela!\" repeated in an everlasting chorus. As \"vela\" is Portuguese a sail, I supposed I had discovered the origin of this, but I found afterwards they used the same cry when heaving anchor, and often chanted it to \"hela,\" which is so much an universal expression of exertion and hard breathing that it is most probably a mere interjectional cry.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I daresay there are now near five hundred people in Dobbo of various races, all met in this remote corner of the East, as they express it, \"to look for their fortune;\" to get money any way they can. They are most of them people who have the very worst reputation for honesty as well as every other form of morality,-- Chinese, Bugis, Ceramese, and half-caste Javanese, with a sprinkling of half-wild Papuans from Timor, Babber, and other islands, yet all goes on as yet very quietly. This motley, ignorant, bloodthirsty, thievish population live here without the shadow of a government, with no police, no courts, and no lawyers; yet they do not cut each other\\'s throats, do not plunder each other day and night, do not fall into the anarchy such a state of things might be supposed to lead to. It is very extraordinary! It puts strange thoughts into one\\'s head about the mountain-load of government under which people exist in Europe, and suggests the idea that we may be over-governed. Think of the hundred Acts of Parliament annually enacted to prevent us, the people of England, from cutting each other\\'s throats, or from doing to our neighbour as we would not be done by. Think of the thousands of lawyers and barristers whose whole lives are spent in telling us what the hundred Acts of Parliament mean, and one would be led to infer that if Dobbo has too little law England has too much.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here we may behold in its simplest form the genius of Commerce at the work of Civilization. Trade is the magic that keeps all at peace, and unites these discordant elements into a well-behaved community. All are traders, and know that peace and order are essential to successful trade, and thus a public opinion is created which puts down all lawlessness. Often in former year, when strolling along the Campong Glam in Singapore, I have thought how wild and ferocious the Bugis sailors looked, and how little should like to trust myself among them. But now I find them to be very decent, well-behaved fellows; I walk daily unarmed in the jungle, where I meet them continually; I sleep in a palm-leaf hut, which any one may enter, with as little fear and as little danger of thieves or murder as if I were under the protection of the Metropolitan police. It is true the Dutch influence is felt here. The islands are nominally under the government of the Moluccas, which the native chiefs acknowledge; and in most years a commissioner arrives from Amboyna, who makes the tour of the islands, hears complaints, settle disputes, and carries away prisoner any heinous offender. This year he is not expected to come, as no orders have yet been received to prepare for him; so the people of Dobbo will probably be left to their own devices. One day a man was caught in the act of stealing a piece of iron from Herr Warzbergen\\'s house, which he had entered by making a hole through the thatch wall. In the evening the chief traders of the place, Bugis and Chinese, assembled, the offender was tried and found guilty, and sentenced to receive twenty lashes on the spot. They were given with a small rattan in the middle of the street, not very severely, the executioner appeared to sympathise a little with the culprit. The disgrace seemed to be thought as much of as the pain; for though any amount of clever cheating is thought rather meritorious than otherwise, open robbery and housebreaking meet with universal reprobation.\\nTHE ARU ISLANDS - JOURNEY AND RESIDENCE IN THE INTERIOR\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(MARCH TO MAY 1857)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0MY boat was at length ready, and having obtained two men besides my own servants, after an enormous amount of talk and trouble, we left Dobbo on the morning of March 13th, for the mainland of Aru. By noon we reached the mouth of a small river or creek, which we ascended, winding among mangrove, swamps, with here and there a glimpse of dry land. In two hours we reached a house, or rather small shed, of the most miserable description, which our steersman, the \"Orang-kaya\" of Wamma, said was the place we were to stay at, and where he had assured me we could get every kind of bird and beast to be found in Aru. The shed was occupied by about a dozen men, women, and children; two cooking fires were burning in it, and there seemed little prospect of my obtaining any accommodation. I however deferred inquiry till I had seen the neighbouring forest, and immediately started off with two men, net, and guns, along a path at the back of the house. In an hour\\'s walk I saw enough to make me determine to give the place a trial, and on my return, finding the \"Orang-kaya\" was in a strong fever-fit and unable to do anything, I entered into negotiations with the owner of the house for the use of a slip at one end of it about five feet wide, for a week, and agreed to pay as rent one \"parang,\" or chopping-knife. I then immediately got my boxes and bedding out of the boat, hung up a shelf for my bird-skins and insects, and got all ready for work next morning. My own boys slept in the boat to guard the remainder of my property; a cooking place sheltered by a few mats was arranged under a tree close by, and I felt that degree of satisfaction and enjoyment which I always experience when, after much trouble and delay, I am on the point of beginning work in a new locality.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0One of my first objects was to inquire for the people who are accustomed to shoot the Paradise birds. They lived at some distance in the jungle, and a man was sent to call them. When they arrived, we had a talk by means of the \"Orang-kaya \"as interpreter, and they said they thought they could get some. They explained that they shoot the birds with a bow and arrow, the arrow having a conical wooden cap fitted to the end as large as a teacup, so as to kill the bird by the violence of the blow without making any wound or shedding any blood. The trees frequented by the birds are very lofty; it is therefore necessary to erect a small leafy covering or hut among the branches, to which the hunter mounts before daylight in the morning and remains the whole day, and whenever a bird alights they are almost sure of securing it. (See Frontispiece.) They returned to their homes the same evening, and I never saw anything more of them, owing, as I afterwards found, to its being too early to obtain birds in good plumage.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The first two or three days of our stay here were very wet, and I obtained but few insects or birds, but at length, when I was beginning to despair, my boy Baderoon returned one day with a specimen which repaid me for months of delay and expectation. It was a small bird a little less than a thrush. The greater part of its plumage was of an intense cinnabar red, with a gloss as of spun glass. On the head the feathers became short and velvety, and shaded into rich orange. Beneath, from the breast downwards, was pure white, with the softness and gloss of silk, and across the breast a band of deep metallic green separated this colour from the red of the throat. Above each eye was a round spot of the same metallic green; the bill was yellow, and the feet and legs were of a fine cobalt ó111e, strikingly contrasting with all the other parts of the body. Merely in arrangement of colours and texture of plumage this little bird was a gem of the first water, yet there comprised only half its strange beauty.  Springing from each side of the breast, and ordinarily lying concealed under the wings, were little tufts of greyish feathers about two inches long, and each terminated by a broad band of intense emerald green. These plumes can be raised at the will of the bird, and spread out into a pair of elegant fans when the wings are elevated. But this is not the only ornament. The two middle feathers of the tail are in the form of slender wires about five inches long, and which diverge in a beautiful double curve. About half an inch of the end of this wire is webbed on the outer side only, awe coloured of a fine metallic green, and being curled spirally inwards form a pair of elegant glittering buttons, hanging five inches below the body, and the same distance apart. These two ornaments, the breast fans and the spiral tipped tail wires, are altogether unique, not occurring on any other species of the eight thousand different birds that are known to exist upon the earth; and, combined with the most exquisite beauty of plumage, render this one of the most perfectly lovely of the many lovely productions of nature. My transports of admiration and delight quite amused my Aru hosts, who saw nothing more in the \"Burong raja\" than we do in the robin of the goldfinch. [footnote: See the upper figure on Plate at commencement of Chapter XXXVIII.]\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Thus one of my objects in coming to the far fast was accomplished. I had obtained a specimen of the King Bird of Paradise (Paradisea regia), which had been described by Linnaeus from skins preserved in a mutilated state by the natives. I knew how few Europeans had ever beheld the perfect little organism I now gazed upon, and how very imperfectly it was still known in Europe. The emotions excited in the minds of a naturalist, who has long desired to see the actual thing which he has hitherto known only by description, drawing, or badly-preserved external covering--especially when that thing is of surpassing rarity and beauty, require the poetic faculty fully to express them. The remote island in which I found myself situated, in an almost unvisited sea, far from the tracks of merchant fleets and navies; the wild luxuriant tropical forest, which stretched far away on every side; the rude uncultured savages who gathered round me,-- all had their influence in determining the emotions with which I gazed upon this \"thing of beauty.\" I thought of the long ages of the past, during which the successive generations of this little creature had run their course--year by year being born, and living and dying amid these dark and gloomy woods, with no intelligent eye to gaze upon their loveliness; to all appearance such a wanton waste of beauty. Such ideas excite a feeling of melancholy. It seems sad, that on the one hand such exquisite creatures should live out their lives and exhibit their charms only in these wild inhospitable regions, doomed for ages yet to come to hopeless barbarism; while on the other hand, should civilized man ever reach these distant lands, and bring moral, intellectual, and physical light into the recesses of these virgin forests, we may be sure that he will so disturb the nicely-balanced relations of organic and inorganic nature as to cause the disappearance, and finally the extinction, of these very beings whose wonderful structure and beauty he alone is fitted to appreciate and enjoy. This consideration must surely tell us that all living things were _not_ made for man. Many of them have no relation to him. The cycle of their existence has gone on independently of his, and is disturbed or broken by every advance in man\\'s intellectual development; and their happiness and enjoyment, their loves and hates, their struggles for existence, their vigorous life and early death, would seem to be immediately related to their own well-being and perpetuation alone, limited only by the equal well-being and perpetuation of the numberless other organisms with which each is more or less intimately connected.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After the first king-bird was obtained, I went with my men into the forest, and we were not only rewarded with another in equally perfect plumage, but I was enabled to see a little of the habits of both it and the larger species. It frequents the lower trees of the less dense forests: and is very active, flying strongly with a whirring sound, and continually hopping or flying from branch to branch. It eats hard stone-bearing fruits as large as a gooseberry, and often flutters its wings after the manner of the South American manakins, at which time it elevates and expands the beautiful fans with which its breast is adorned. The natives of Aru call it \"Goby-goby.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0One day I get under a tree where a number of the Great Paradise birds were assembled, but they were high up in the thickest of the foliage, and flying and jumping about so continually that I could get no good view of them. At length I shot one, but it was a young specimen, and was entirely of a rich chocolate-brown colour, without either the metallic green throat or yellow plumes of the full-grown bird. All that I had yet seen resembled this, and the natives told me that it would be about two months before any would be found in full plumage. I still hoped, therefore, to get some. Their voice is most extraordinary. At early morn, before the sun has risen, we hear a loud cry of \"Wawk-wawk-wawk, wók-wók-wók,\" which resounds through the forest, changing its direction continually. This is the Great Bird of Paradise going to seek his breakfast. Others soon follow his example; lories and parroquets cry shrilly, cockatoos scream, king-hunters croak and bark, and the various smaller birds chirp and whistle their morning song. As I lie listening to these interesting sounds, I realize my position as the first European who has ever lived for months together in the Aru islands, a place which I had hoped rather than expected ever to visit. I think how many besides my self have longed to reach these almost fairy realms, and to see with their own eyes the many wonderful and beautiful things which I am daily encountering. But now Ali and Baderoon are up and getting ready their guns and ammunition, and little Brio has his fire lighted and is boiling my coffee, and I remember that I had a black cockatoo brought in late last night, which I must skin immediately, and so I jump up and begin my day\\'s work very happily.\\nHEAD OF BLACK COCKATOO\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This cockatoo is the first I have seen, and is a great prize. It has a rather small and weak body, long weak legs, large wings, and an enormously developed head, ornamented with a magnificent crest, and armed with a sharp-pointed hoofed bill of immense size and strength. The plumage is entirely black, but has all over it the curious powdery white secretion characteristic of cockatoo. The cheeks are bare, and of an intense blood-red colour. Instead of the harsh scream of the white cockatoos, its voice is a somewhat plaintive whistle. The tongue is a curious organ, being a slender fleshy cylinder of a deep red colour, terminated by a horny black plate, furrowed across and somewhat prehensile. The whole tongue has a considerable extensile power. I will here relate something of the habits of this bird, with which I have since become acquainted. It frequents the lower parts of the forest, and is seen singly, or at most two or three together. It flies slowly and noiselessly, and may be killed by a comparatively slight wound. It eats various fruits arid seeds, but seems more particularly attached to the kernel of the kanary- nut, which grows on a lofty forest tree (Canarium commune), abundant in the islands where this bird is found; and the manner in which it gets at these seeds shows a correlation of structure and habits, which would point out the \"kanary\" as its special food. The shell of this nut is so excessively hard that only a heavy hammer will crack it; it is somewhat triangular, and the outside is quite smooth. The manner in which the bird opens these nuts is very curious. Taking one endways in its bill and keeping it firm by a pressure of the tongue, it cuts a transverse notch by a lateral sawing motion of the sharp-edged lower mandible. This done, it takes hold of the nut with its foot, and biting off a piece of leaf retains it in the deep notch of the upper mandible, and again seizing the nut, which is prevented from slipping by the elastic tissue of the leaf, fixes the edge of the lower mandible in the notch, and by a powerful nip breaks of a piece of the shell. again taking the nut in its claws, it inserts the very long and sharp point of the bill and picks out the kernel, which is seized hold of, morsel by morsel, by the extensible tongue. Thus every detail of form. and structure in the extraordinary bill of this bird seems to have its use, and we may easily conceive that the black cockatoos have maintained themselves in competition with their more active and more numerous white allies, by their power of existing on a kind of food which no other bird is able to extract from its stony shell. The species is the Microglossum aterrimum of naturalists.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0During the two weeks which I spent in this little settlement, I had good opportunities of observing the natives at their own home, and living in their usual manner. There is a great monotony and uniformity in everyday savage life, and it seemed to me a more miserable existence than when it had the charm of novelty. To begin with the most important fact in the existence of uncivilized peoples--their food--the Aru men have no regular supply, no staff of life, such as bread, rice, mandiocca, maize, or sago, which are the daily food of a large proportion of mankind. They have, however, many sorts of vegetables, plantains, yams, sweet potatoes, and raw sago; and they chew up vast quantities of sugar-cane, as well as betel-nuts, gambir, and tobacco. Those who live on the coast have plenty of fish; but when inland, as we are here, they only go to the sea occasionally, and then bring home cockles and other shell-fish by the boatload. Now and then they get wild pig or kangaroo, but too rarely to form anything like a regular part of their diet, which is essentially vegetable; and what is of more importance, as affecting their health, green, watery vegetables, imperfectly cooked, and even these in varying and often in sufficient quantities. To this diet may be attributed the prevalence of skin diseases, and ulcers on the legs and joints. The scurfy skin disease so common among savages has a close connexion with the poorness and irregularity of their living. The Malays, who are never without their daily rice, are generally free from it; the hill-Dyaks of Borneo, who grow rice and live well, are clean skinned while the less industrious and less cleanly tribes, who live for a portion of the year on fruits and vegetables only, are very subject to this malady. It seems clear that in this, as in other respects, man is not able to make a beast of himself with impunity, feeding like the cattle on the herbs and fruits of the earth, and taking no thought of the morrow. To maintain his health and beauty he must labour to prepare some farinaceous product capable of being stored and accumulated, so as to give him a regular supply of wholesome food. When this is obtained, he may add vegetables, fruits, and meat with advantage.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The chief luxury of the Aru people, besides betel and tobacco, is arrack (Java rum), which the traders bring in great quantities and sell very cheap. A day\\'s fishing or rattan cutting will purchase at least a half-gallon bottle; and when the tripang or birds\\' nests collected during a season are sold, they get whole boxes, each containing fifteen such bottles, which the inmates of a house will sit round day and night till they have finished. They themselves tell me that at such bouts they often tear to pieces the house they are in, break and destroy everything they can lay their hands on, and make such an infernal riot as is alarming to behold.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The houses and furniture are on a par with the food. A rude shed, supported on rough and slender sticks rather than posts, no walls, but the floor raised to within a foot of the eaves, is the style of architecture they usually adopt. Inside there are partition walls of thatch, forming little boxes or sleeping places, to accommodate the two or three separate families that usually live together. A few mats, baskets, and cooking vessels, with plates and basins purchased from the Macassar traders, constitute their whole furniture; spears and bows are their weapons; a sarong or mat forms the clothing of the women, a waistcloth of the men. For hours or even for days they sit idle in their houses, the women bringing in the vegetables or sago which form their food. Sometimes they hunt or fish a little, or work at their houses or canoes, but they seem to enjoy pure idleness, and work as little as they can. They have little to vary the monotony of life, little that can be called pleasure, except idleness and conversation. And they certainly do talk! Every evening there is a little Babel around me: but as I understand not a word of it, I go on with my book or work undisturbed. Now and then they scream and shout, or laugh frantically for variety; and this goes on alternately with vociferous talking of men, women, and children, till long after I am in my mosquito curtain and sound asleep.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At this place I obtained some light on the complicated mixture of races in Aru, which would utterly confound an ethnologist. Many of the, natives, though equally dark with the others, have little of the Papuan physiognomy, but have more delicate features of the European type, with more glossy, curling hair: These at first quite puzzled me, for they have no more resemblance to Malay than to Papuan, and the darkness of skin and hair would forbid the idea of Dutch intermixture. Listening to their conversation, however, I detected some words that were familiar to me. \"Accabó\" was one; and to be sure that it was not an accidental resemblance, I asked the speaker in Malay what \"accabó\" meant, and was told it meant \"done or finished,\" a true Portuguese word, with its meaning retained. Again, I heard the word \"jafui\" often repeated, and could see, without inquiry, that its meaning was \"he\\'s gone,\" as in Portuguese. \"Porco,\" too, seems a common name, though the people have no idea of its European meaning. This cleared up the difficulty. I at once understood that some early Portuguese traders had penetrated to these islands, and mixed with the natives, influencing their language, and leaving in their descendants for many generations the visible characteristics of their race. If to this we add the occasional mixture of Malay, Dutch, and Chinese with the indigenous Papuans, we have no reason to wonder at the curious varieties of form and feature occasionally to be met with in Aru. In this very house there was a Macassar man, with an Aru wife and a family of mixed children. In Dobbo I saw a Javanese and an Amboyna man, each with an Aru wife and family; and as this kind of mixture has been going on for at least three hundred years, and probably much longer, it has produced a decided effect on the physical characteristics of a considerable portion of the population of the islands, more especially in Dobbo and the parts nearest to it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0March 28th. -- The \"Orang-kaya\" being very ill with fever had begged to go home, and had arranged with one of the men of the house to go on with me as his substitute. Now that I wanted to move, the bugbear of the pirates was brought up, and it was pronounced unsafe to go further than the next small river. This world not suit me, as I had determined to traverse the channel called Watelai to the \"blakang-tana;\" but my guide was firm in his dread of pirates, of which I knew there was now no danger, as several vessels had gone in search of them, as well as a Dutch gunboat which had arrived since I left Dobbo. I had, fortunately, by this time heard that the Dutch \"Commissie\" had really arrived, and therefore threatened that if my guide did not go with me immediately, I would appeal to the authorities, and he would certainly be obliged to gig a back the cloth which the \"Orang- kaya\" had transferred to him in prepayment. This had the desired effect; matters were soon arranged, and we started the next morning. The wind, however, was dead against us, and after rowing hard till midday we put in to a small river where there were few huts, to cook our dinners. The place did not look very promising, but as we could not reach our destination, the Watelai river, owing to the contrary wind, I thought we might as well wait here a day or two. I therefore paid a chopper for the use of a small shed, and got my bed and some boxes on shore. In the evening, after dark, we were suddenly alarmed by the cry of \"Bajak! bajak!\" (Pirates!) The men all seized their bows and spears, and rushed down to the beach; we got hold of our guns and prepared for action, but in a few minutes all came back laughing and chattering, for it had proved to be only a small boat and some of their own comrades returned from fishing. When all was quiet again, one of the men, who could speak a little Malay, came to me and begged me not to sleep too hard. \"Why?\" said I. \"Perhaps the pirates may really come,\" said he very seriously, which made me laugh and assure him I should sleep as hard as I could.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Two days were spent here, but the place was unproductive of insects or birds of interest, so we made another attempt to get on. As soon as we got a little away from the land we had a fair wind, and in six hours\\' sailing reached the entrance of the Watelai channel, which divides the most northerly from the middle portion of Aru. At its mouth this was about half a mile wide, but soon narrowed, and a mile or two on it assumed entirely the aspect of a river about the width of the Thames at London, winding among low but undulating and often hilly country. The scene was exactly such as might be expected in the interior of a continent. The channel continued of a uniform average width, with reaches and sinuous bends, one bank being often precipitous, or even forming vertical cliffs, while the other was flat and apparently alluvial; and it was only the pure salt-water, and the absence of any stream but the slight flux and reflux of the tide, that would enable a person to tell that he was navigating a strait and not a river. The wind was fair, and carried us along, with occasional assistance from our oars, till about three in the afternoon, when we landed where a little brook formed two or three basins in the coral rock, and then fell in a miniature cascade into the salt water river. Here we bathed and cooked our dinner, and enjoyed ourselves lazily till sunset, when we pursued our way for two hours snore, and then moored our little vessel to an overhanging tree for the night.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At five the next morning we started again, and in an hour overtook four large praus containing the \"Commissie,\" who had come from Dobbo to make their official tour round the islands, and had passed us in the eight. I paid a visit to the Dutchmen, one of whom spoke a little English, but we found that we could get on much better with Malay. They told me that they had been delayed going after the pirates to one of the northern islands, and had seen three of their vessels but could not catch them, because on being pursued they rowed out in the wind\\'s eye, which they are enabled to do by having about fifty oars to each boat. Having had some tea with thorn, I bade them adieu, and turned up a narrow channel which our pilot said would take us to the village of Watelai, on the west side- of Are. After going some miles we found the channel nearly blocked up with coral, so that our boat grated along the bottom, crunching what may truly be called the living rock. Sometimes all hands had to get out and wade, to lighten the vessel and lift it over the shallowest places; but at length we overcame all obstacles and reached a wide bay or estuary studded with little rocks and islets, and opening to the western sea and the numerous islands of the \"blakang-tuna.\" I now found that the village we were going to was miles away; that we should have to go out to sea, and round a rocky point. A squall seemed coming on, and as I have a horror of small boats at sea, and from all I could learn Watelai village was not a place to stop at (no birds of Paradise being found there), I determined to return and go to a village I had heard of up a tributary of the Watelai river, and situated nearly in the centre of the mainland of Aru. The people there were said to be good, and to be accustomed to hunting and bird-catching, being too far inland to get any part of their food from the sea. While I was deciding this point the squall burst upon us, and soon raised a rolling sea in the shallow water, which upset an oil bottle and a lamp, broke some of my crockery, and threw us all into confusion. Rowing hard we managed to get back into the main river by dusk, and looked out for a place to cook our suppers. It happened to be high water, and a very high tide, so that every piece of sand or beach was covered, and it was with the greatest difficulty, and after much groping in the dark, that we discovered a little sloping piece of rock about two feet square on which to make a fire and cook some rice. The next day we continued our way back, and on the following day entered a stream on the south side of the Watelai river, and ascending to where navigation ceased found the little village of Wanumbai, consisting of two large houses surrounded by plantations, amid the virgin forests of Aru.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As I liked the look of the place, and was desirous of staying some time, I sent my pilot to try and make a bargain for house accommodation. The owner and chief man of the place made many excuses. First, be was afraid I would not like his house, and then was doubtful whether his son, who was away, would like his admitting me. I had a long talk with him myself, and tried to explain what I was doing, and how many things I would buy of them, and showed him my stock of heads, and knives, and cloth, and tobacco, all of which I would spend with his family and friends if he would give me house-room. He seemed a little staggered at this, and said he, would talk to his wife, and in the meantime I went for a little walk to see the neighbourhood. When I carne back, I again sent my pilot, saying that I would go away if he would not dive me part of his house. In about half an hour he returned with a demand for about half the cost of building a house, for the rent of a small portion of it for a few weeks. As the only difficulty now was a pecuniary one, I got out about ten yards of cloth, an axe, with a few beads and some tobacco, and sent them as my final offer for the part of the house which I had before pointed out. This was accepted after a little more talk, and I immediately proceeded to take possession.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The house was a good large one, raised as usual about seven feet on posts, the walls about three or four feet more, with a high- pitched roof. The floor was of bamboo laths, and in the sloping roof way an immense shutter, which could be lifted and propped up to admit light and air. At the end where this was situated the floor was raised about a foot, and this piece, about ten feet wide by twenty long, quite open to the rest of the house, was the portion I was to occupy. At one end of this piece, separated by a thatch partition, was a cooking place, with a clay floor and shelves for crockery. At the opposite end I had my mosquito curtain hung, and round the walls we arranged my boxes and other stores, fated up a table and seat, and with a little cleaning and dusting made the place look quite comfortable. My boat was then hauled up on shore, and covered with palm-leaves, the sails and oars brought indoors, a hanging-stage for drying my specimens erected outside the house and another inside, and my boys were set to clean their gnus and get ail ready for beginning work.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next day I occupied myself in exploring the paths in the immediate neighbourhood. The small river up which we had ascended ceases to be navigable at this point, above which it is a little rocky brook, which quite dries up in the hot season. There was now, however, a fair stream of water in it; and a path which was partly in and partly by the side of the water, promised well for insects, as I here saw the magnificent blue butterfly, Papilio ulysses, as well as several other fine species, flopping lazily along, sometimes resting high up on the foliage which drooped over the water, at others settling down on the damp rock or on the edges of muddy pools. A little way on several paths branched off through patches of second-growth forest to cane-fields, gardens, and scattered houses, beyond which again the dark wall of verdure striped with tree-trunks, marked out the limits of the primeval forests. The voices of many birds promised good shooting, and on my return I found that my boy s had already obtained two or three kinds I had not seen before; and in the evening a native brought me a rare and beautiful species of ground-thrush (Pitta novaeguinaeae) hitherto only known from New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As I improved my acquaintance with them I became much interested in these people, who are a fair sample of the true savage inhabitants of the Aru Islands, tolerably free from foreign admixture. The house I lived in contained four or five families, and there were generally from six to a dozen visitors besides. They kept up a continual row from morning till night--talking, laughing, shouting, without intermission--not very pleasant, but interesting as a study of national character. My boy Ali said to me, \"Banyak quot bitchara Orang Aru \"(The Aru people are very strong talkers), never having been accustomed to such eloquence either in his own or any other country he had hitherto visited. Of an evening the men, having got over their first shyness, began to talk to me a little, asking about my country, &c., and in return I questioned them about any traditions they had of their own origin. I had, however, very little success, for I could not possibly make them understand the simple question of where the Aru people first came from. I put it in every possible way to them, but it was a subject quite beyond their speculations; they had evidently never thought of anything of the kind, and were unable to conceive a thing so remote and so unnecessary to be thought about, as their own origin. Finding this hopeless, I asked if they knew when the trade with Aru first began, when the Bugis and Chinese and Macassar men first came in their praus to buy tripang and tortoise-shell, and birds\\' nests, arid Paradise birds?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This they comprehended, but replied that there had always been the same trade as long as they or their fathers recollected, but that this was the first time a real white man had come among them, and, said they, \"You see how the people come every day from all the villages round to look at you.\" This was very flattering, and accounted for the great concourse of visitors which I had at first imagined was accidental. A few years before I had been one of the gazers at the Zoolus, and the Aztecs in London. Now the tables were turned upon me, for I was to these people a new and strange variety of man, and had the honour of affording to them, in my own person, an attractive exhibition, gratis.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All the men and boys of Aru are expert archers, never stirring without their bows and arrows. They shoot all sorts of birds, as well as pigs and kangaroos occasionally, and thus have a tolerably good supply of meat to eat with their vegetables. The result of this better living is superior healthiness, well-made bodies, and generally clear skins. They brought me numbers of small birds in exchange for beads or tobacco, but mauled them terribly, notwithstanding my repeated instructions. When they got a bird alive they would often tie a string to its leg, and keep it a day or two, till its plumage was so draggled and dirtied as to be almost worthless. One of the first things I got from there was a living specimen of the curious and beautiful racquet-tailed kingfisher. Seeing how much I admired it, they afterwards brought me several more, which wore all caught before daybreak, sleeping in cavities of the rocky banks of the stream. My hunters also shot a few specimens, and almost all of them had the red bill more or less clogged with mud and earth. This indicates the habits of the bird, which, though popularly a king-fisher, never catches fish, but lives on insects and minute shells, which it picks up in the forest, darting down upon them from its perch on some low branch. The genus Tanysiptera, to which this bird belongs, is remarkable for the enormously lengthened tail, which in all other kingfishers is small and short. Linnaeus named the species known to him \"the goddess kingfisher\" (Alcedo dea), from its extreme grace and beauty, the plumage being brilliant blue and white, with the bill red, like coral. Several species of these interesting birds are now known, all confined within the very limited area which comprises the Moluccas, New Guinea, and the extreme North of Australia. They resemble each other so closely that several of them can only be distinguished by careful comparison. One of the rarest, however, which inhabits New Guinea, is very distinct from the rest, being bright red beneath instead of white. That which I now obtained was a new one, and has been named Tanysiptera hydrocharis, but in general form and coloration it is exactly similar to the larger species found in Amboyna, and figured at page 468 of my first volume.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0New and interesting birds were continually brought in, either by my own boys or by the natives, and at the end of a week Ali arrived triumphant one afternoon with a fine specimen of the Great Bird of Paradise. The ornamental plumes had not yet attained their full growth, but the richness of their glossy orange colouring, and the exquisite delicacy of the loosely waving feathers, were unsurpassable. At the same time a great black cockatoo was brought in, as well as a fine fruit-pigeon and several small birds, so that we were all kept hard at work skinning till sunset. Just as we had cleared away and packed up for the night, a strange beast was brought, which had been shot by the natives. It resembled in size, and in its white woolly covering, a small fat lamb, but had short legs, hand-like feet with large claws, and a long prehensile tail. It was a Cuscus (C. maculatus), one of the curious marsupial animals of the Papuan region, and I was very desirous to obtain the skin. The owners, however, said they wanted to eat it; and though I offered them a good price, and promised to give them all the meat, there was grout hesitation. Suspecting the reason, I offered, though it was night, to set to work immediately and get out the body for them, to which they agreed. The creature was much hacked about, and the two hind feet almost cut off; but it was the largest and finest specimen of the kind I had seen; and after an hour\\'s hard work I handed over the body to the owners, who immediately cut it up and roasted it for supper.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As this was a very good place for birds, I determined to remain a month longer, and took the opportunity of a native boat going to Dobbo, to send Ali for a fresh supply of ammunition and provisions. They started on the 10th of April, and the house was crowded with about a hundred men, boys, women, and girls, bringing their loads of sugar-cane, plantains, sirih-leaf, yams, &c.; one lad going from each house to sell the produce and make purchases. The noise was indescribable. At least fifty of the hundred were always talking at once, and that not in the low measured tones of the apathetically polite Malay, but with loud voices, shouts, and screaming laughter, in which the women and children were even more conspicuous than the men. It was only while gazing at me that their tongues were moderately quiet, because their eyes were fully occupied. The black vegetable soil here overlying the coral rock is very rich, and the sugar-cane was finer than any I had ever seen. The canes brought to the boat were often ten and even twelve feet long, and thick in proportion, with short joints throughout, swelling between the knots with the, abundance of the rich juice. At Dobbo they get a high price for it, 1d. to 3d. a stick, and there is an insatiable demand among the crews of the praus and the Baba fishermen. Here they eat it continually. They half live on it, and sometimes feed their pigs with it. Near every house are great heaps of the refuse cane; and large wicker-baskets to contain this refuse as it is produced form a regular part of the furniture of a house. Whatever time of the day you enter, you are sure to find three or four people with a yard of cane in one hand, a knife in the other, and a basket between their legs, hacking, paring, chewing, and basket-filling, with a persevering assiduity which reminds one of a hungry cow grazing, or of a caterpillar eating up a leaf.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After five days absence the boats returned from Dobbo, bringing Ali and all the things I had sent for quite safe. A large party had assembled to be ready to carry home the goods brought, among which were a good many cocoa-nut, which are a great luxury here. It seems strange that they should never plant them; but the reason simply is, that they cannot bring their hearts to bury a good nut for the prospective advantage of a crop twelve years hence. There is also the chance of the fruits being dug up and eaten unless watched night and day. Among the things I had sent for was a box of arrack, and I was now of course besieged with requests for a little drop. I gave them a flask (about two bottles, which was very soon finished, and I was assured that there were many present who had not had a taste. As I feared my box would very soon be emptied if I supplied all their demands, I told them I had given them one, but the second they must pay for, and that afterwards I must have a Paradise bird for each flask. They immediately sent round to all the neighbouring houses, and mustered up a rupee in Dutch copper money, got their second flask, and drunk it as quickly as the first, and were then very talkative, but less noisy and importunate than I had expected. Two or three of them got round me and begged me for the twentieth time to tell them the name of my country. Then, as they could not pronounce it satisfactorily, they insisted that I was deceiving them, and that it was a name of my own invention. One funny old man, who bore a ludicrous resemblance, to a friend of mine at home, was almost indignant. \"Ung-lung! \"said he, \"who ever heard of such a name?--ang lang--anger-lung--that can\\'t be the name of your country; you are playing with us.\" Then he tried to give a convincing illustration. \"My country is Wanumbai--anybody can say Wanumbai. I\\'m an ` orang-Wanumbai; but, N-glung! who ever heard of such a name? Do tell us the real name of your country, and then when you are gone we shall know how to talk about you.\" To this luminous argument and remonstrance I could oppose nothing but assertion, and the whole party remained firmly convinced that I was for some reason or other deceiving them. They then attacked me on another point--what all the animals and birds and insects and shells were preserved so carefully for. They had often asked me this before, and I had tried to explain to them that they would be stuffed, and made to look as if alive, and people in my country would go to look at them. But this was not satisfying; in my country there must be many better things to look at, and they could not believe I would take so much trouble with their birds and beasts just for people to look at. They did not want to look at them; and we, who made calico and glass and knives, and all sorts of wonderful things, could not want things from Aru to look at. They had evidently been thinking about it, and had at length got what seemed a very satisfactory theory; for the same old man said to me, in a low, mysterious voice, \"What becomes of them when you go on to the sea?\" \"Why, they are all packed up in boxes,\" said I \"What did you think became of them?\" \"They all come to life again, don\\'t they?\" said he; and though I tried to joke it off, and said if they did we should have plenty to eat at sea, he stuck to his opinion, and kept repeating, with an air of deep conviction, \"Yes, they all come to life again, that\\'s what they do--they all come to life again.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After a little while, and a good deal of talking among themselves, he began again--\"I know all about it--oh yes! Before you came we had rain every day--very wet indeed; now, ever since you have been here, it is fine hot weather. Oh, yes! I know all about it; you can\\'t deceive me.\" And so I was set down as a conjurer, and was unable to repel the charge. But the conjurer was completely puzzled by the next question: \"What,\" said the old man, \"is the great ship, where the Bugis and Chinamen go to sell their things? It is always in the great sea--its name is Jong; tell us all about it.\" In vain I inquired what they knew about it; they knew nothing but that it was called \"Jong,\" and was always in the sea, and was a very great ship, and concluded with, \"Perhaps that is your country?\" Finding that I could not or would not tell them anything about \"Jong,\" there came more regrets that I would not tell them the real name of my country; and then a long string of compliments, to the effect that I was a much better sort of a person than the Bugis and Chinese, who sometimes came to trade with them, for I gave them things for nothing, and did not try to cheat them. How long would I stop? was the next earnest inquiry. Would I stay two or three months? They would get me plenty of birds and animals, and I might soon finish all the goods I had brought, and then, said the old spokesman, \"Don\\'t go away, but send for more things from Dobbo, and stay here a year or two.\" And then again the old story, \"Do tell us the name of your country. We know the Bugis men, and the Macassar men, and the Java men, and the China men; only you, we don\\'t know from what country you come. Ung-lung! it can\\'t be; I know that is not the name of your country.\" Seeing no end to this long talk, I said I was tired, and wanted to go to sleep; so after begging-- one a little bit of dry fish for his supper, and another a little salt to eat with his sago--they went off very quietly, and I went outside and took a stroll round the house by moonlight, thinking of the simple people and the strange productions of Aru, and then turned in under my mosquito curtain; to sleep with a sense of perfect security in the midst of these good-natured savages.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now had seven or eight days of hot and dry weather, which reduced the little river to a succession of shallow pools connected by the smallest possible thread of trickling water. If there were a dry season like that of Macassar, the Aru Islands would be uninhabitable, as there is no part of them much above a hundred feet high; and the whole being a mass of porous coralline rock, allows the surface water rapidly to escape. The only dry season they have is for a month or two about September or October, and there is then an excessive scarcity of water, so that sometimes hundreds of birds and other animals die of drought. The natives then remove to houses near the sources of the small streams, where, in the shady depths of the forest, a small quantity of water still remains. Even then many of them have to go miles for their water, which they keep in large bamboos and use very sparingly. They assure me that they catch and kill game of all kinds, by watching at the water holes or setting snares around them. That would be the time for me to make my collections; but the want of water would be a terrible annoyance, and the impossibility of getting away before another whole year had passed made it out of the question.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Ever since leaving Dobbo I had suffered terribly from insects, who seemed here bent upon revenging my long-continued persecution of their race. At our first stopping-place sand-flies were very abundant at night, penetrating to every part of the body, and producing a more lasting irritation than mosquitoes. My feet and ankles especially suffered, and were completely covered with little red swollen specks, which tormented me horribly. On arriving here we were delighted to find the house free from sand- flies or mosquitoes, but in the plantations where my daily walks led me, the day-biting mosquitoes swarmed, and seemed especially to delight in attaching my poor feet. After a month\\'s incessant punishment, those useful members rebelled against such treatment and broke into open insurrection, throwing out numerous inflamed ulcers, which were very painful, and stopped me from walking. So I found myself confined to the house, and with no immediate prospect of leaving it. Wounds or sores in the feet are especially difficult to heal in hot climates, and I therefore dreaded them more than any other illness. The confinement was very annoying, as the fine hot weather was excellent for insects, of which I had every promise of obtaining a fine collection; and it is only by daily and unremitting search that the smaller kinds, and the rarer and more interesting specimens, can be obtained. When I crawled down to the river-side to bathe, I often saw the blue-winged Papilio ulysses, or some other equally rare and beautiful insect; but there was nothing for it but patience, and to return quietly to my bird-skinning, or whatever other work I had indoors. The stings and bites and ceaseless irritation caused by these pests of the tropical forests, would be borne uncomplainingly; but to be kept prisoner by them in so rich and unexplored a country where rare and beautiful creatures are to be met with in every forest ramble--a country reached by such a long and tedious voyage, and which might not in the present century be again visited for the same purpose--is a punishment too severe for a naturalist to pass over in silence.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I had, however, some consolation in the birds my boys brought home daily, more especially the Paradiseas, which they at length obtained in full plumage. It was quite a relief to my mind to get these, for I could hardly have torn myself away from Aru had I not obtained specimens.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But what I valued almost as much as the birds themselves was the knowledge of their habits, which I was daily obtaining both from the accounts of my hunters, and from the conversation of the natives. The birds had now commenced what the people here call their \"sacaleli,\" or dancing-parties, in certain trees in the forest, which are not fruit trees as I at first imagined, but which have an immense tread of spreading branches and large but scattered leaves, giving a clear space for the birds to play and exhibit their plumes. On one of these trees a dozen or twenty full-plumaged male birds assemble together, raise up their wings, stretch out their necks, and elevate their exquisite plumes, keeping them in a continual vibration. Between whiles they fly across from branch to branch in great excitement, so that the whole tree is filled with waving plumes in every variety of attitude and motion. (See Frontispiece.) The bird itself is nearly as large as a crow, and is of a rich coffee brown colour. The head and neck is of a pure straw yellow above and rich metallic green beneath. The long plumy tufts of golden orange feathers spring from the sides beneath each wing, and when the bird is in repose are partly concealed by them. At the time of its excitement, however, the wings are raised vertically over tile back, the head is bent down and stretched out, and the long plumes are raised up and expanded till they form two magnificent golden fans, striped with deep red at the base, and fading off into the pale brown tint of the finely divided and softly waving points. The whole bird is then overshadowed by them, the crouching body, yellow head, and emerald green throat forming but the foundation and setting to the golden glory which waves above. When seen in this attitude, the Bird of Paradise really deserves its name, and must be ranked as one of the most beautiful and most wonderful of living things. I continued also to get specimens of the lovely little king-bird occasionally, as well as numbers of brilliant pigeons, sweet little parroquets, and many curious small birds, most nearly resembling those of Australia and New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here, as among most savage people I have dwelt among, I was delighted with the beauty of the human form-a beauty of which stay-at-home civilized people can scarcely have any conception. What are the finest Grecian statues to the living, moving, breathing men I saw daily around me? The unrestrained grace of the naked savage as he goes about his daily occupations, or lounges at his ease, must be seen to be understood; and a youth bending his bow is the perfection of manly beauty. The women, however, except in extreme youth, are by no means so pleasant to look at as the men. Their strongly-marked features are very unfeminine, and hard work, privations, and very early marriages soon destroy whatever of beauty or grace they may for a short time possess. Their toilet is very simple, but also, I am sorry to say, very coarse, and disgusting. It consists solely of a mat of plaited strips of palm leaves, worn tight round the body, and reaching from the hips to the knees. It seems not to be changed till worn out, is seldom washed, and is generally very dirty. This is the universal dress, except in a few cases where Malay \"sarongs\" have come into use. Their frizzly hair is tied in a bench at the back of the head. They delight in combing, or rather forking it, using for that purpose a large wooden fork with four diverging prongs, which answers the purpose of separating and arranging the long tangled, frizzly mass of cranial vegetation much better than any comb could do. The only ornaments of the women are earrings and necklaces, which they arrange in various tasteful ways. The ends of a necklace are often attached to the earrings, and then looped on to the hair-knot behind. This has really an elegant appearance, the beads hanging gracefully on each side of the head, and by establishing a connexion with the earrings give an appearance of utility to those barbarous ornaments. We recommend this style to the consideration of those of the fair sex who still bore holes in their ears and hang rings thereto. Another style of necklace among these Papuan belles is to wear two, each hanging on one side of the neck and under the opposite arm, so as to cross each other. This has a very pretty appearance, in part due to the contrast of the white beads or kangaroo teeth of which they are composed with the dark glossy skin. The earrings themselves are formed of a bar of copper or silver, twisted so that the ends cross. The men, as usual among savages, adorn themselves more than the women. They wear necklaces, earrings, and finger rings, and delight in a band of plaited grass tight round the arm just below the shoulder, to which they attach a bunch of hair or bright coloured feathers by way of ornament. The teeth of small animals, either alone, or alternately with black or white beads, form their necklaces, and sometimes bracelets also. For these latter, however, they prefer brass wire, or the black, horny, wing-spines of the cassowary, which they consider a charm. Anklets of brass or shell, and tight plaited garters below the knee, complete their ordinary decorations.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some natives of Kobror from further south, and who are reckoned the worst and least civilized of the Aru tribes, came one day to visit us. They have a rather more than usually savage appearance, owing to the greater amount of ornaments they use--the most conspicuous being a large horseshoe-shaped comb which they wear over the forehead, the ends resting on the temples. The back of the comb is fastened into a piece of wood, which is plated with tin in front, and above is attached a plume of feathers from a cock\\'s tail. In other respects they scarcely differed from the people I was living with. They brought me a couple of birds, some shells and insects; showing that the report of the white man and his doing had reached their country. There was probably hardly a man in Aru who had not by this time heard of me.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Besides the domestic utensils already mentioned, the moveable property of a native is very scanty. He has a good supply of spears and bows and arrows for hunting, a parang, or chopping- knife, and an axe-for the stone age has passed away here, owing to the commercial enterprise of the Bugis and other Malay races. Attached to a belt, or hung across his shoulder, he carrion a little skin pouch and an ornamented bamboo, containing betel-nut, tobacco, and lime, and a small German wooden-handled knife is generally stuck between his waist-cloth of bark and his bare shin. Each man also possesses a °cadjan,\" or sleeping-mat, made of the broad leaves of a pandanus neatly sewn together in- three layers. This mat is abort four feet square, and when folded has one end sewn up, so that it forms a kind of sack open at one side. In the closed corner the head or feet can be placed, or by carrying it on the head in a shower it forms both coat and umbrella. It doubles up ix a small compass for convenient carriage, and then forms a light and elastic cushion, so that on a journey it becomes clothing, house, bedding, and furniture, all in one.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The only ornaments in an Aru horse are trophies of the chase-- jaws of wild pigs, the heads and backbones of cassowaries, and plumes made from the feathers of the Bird of Paradise, cassowary, and domestic fowl. The spears, shields, knife-handles, and other utensils are more or less carved in fanciful designs, and the mats and leaf boxes are painted or plaited in neat patterns of red, black, and yellow colours. I must not forget these boxes, which are most ingeniously made of the pith of a balm leaf pegged together, lined inside with pandanus leaves, and outside with the same, or with plaited grass. All the joints and angles are coffered with strips of split rattan sewn neatly on. The lid is covered with the brown leathery spathe of the Areca palm, which is impervious to water, and the whole box is neat, strong, and well finished. They are made from a few inches to two or three feet long, and being much esteemed by the Malay as clothes-boxes, are a regular article of export from Aru. The natives use the smaller ones for tobacco or betel-nut, but seldom have clothes enough to require the larger ones, which are only made for sale.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Among the domestic animals which may generally be seen in native houses, are gaudy parrots, green, red, and blue, a few domestic fowls, which have baskets hung for them to lay in under the eaves, and who sleep on the ridge, and several half-starved wolfish-baking dogs. Instead of rats and mice there are curious little marsupial animals about the same size, which run about at night and nibble anything eatable that may be left uncovered. Four or five different kinds of ants attack everything not isolated by water, and one kind even swims across that; great spiders lurk in baskets and boxes, or hide in the folds of my mosquito curtain; centipedes and millepedes are found everywhere. I have caught them under my pillow and on my bead; while in every box, and under every hoard which has lain for some days undisturbed, little scorpions are sure to be found snugly ensconced, with their formidable tails quickly turned up ready for attack or defence. Such companions seem very alarming and dangerous, but all combined are not so bad as the irritation of mosquitoes, or of the insect pests often found at home. These latter are a constant and unceasing source of torment and disgust, whereas you may live a long time among scorpions, spiders, and centipedes, ugly and venomous though they are, and get no harm from them. After living twelve years in the tropics, I have never yet been bitten or stung by either.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The lean and hungry dogs before mentioned were my greatest enemies, and kept me constantly on the watch. If my boys left the bird they were skinning for an instant, it was sure to be carried off. Everything eatable had to be hung up to the roof, to be out of their reach. Ali had just finished skinning a fine King Bird of Paradise one day, when he dropped the skin. Before he could stoop to pick it up, one of this famished race had seized upon it, and he only succeeded in rescuing it from its fangs after it was torn to tatters. Two skins of the large Paradisea, which were quite dry and ready to pack away, were incautiously left on my table for the night, wrapped up in paper. The next morning they were gone, and only a few scattered feathers indicated their fate. My hanging shelf was out of their reach; but having stupidly left a box which served as a step, a full-plumaged Paradise bird was next morning missing; and a dog below the house was to be seen still mumbling over the fragments, with the fine golden plumes all trampled in the mud. Every night, as soon as I was in bed, I could hear them searching about for what they could devour, under my table, and all about my boxes and baskets, keeping me in a state of suspense till morning, lest something of value might incautiously have been left within their read. They would drink the oil of my floating lamp and eat the wick, and upset or break my crockery if my lazy boys had neglected to wash away even the smell of anything eatable. Bad, however, as they are here, they were worse in a Dyak\\'s house in Borneo where I was once staying, for there they gnawed off the tops of my waterproof boots, ate a large piece out of an old leather game-bag, besides devouring a portion of my mosquito curtain!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0April 28th. -- Last evening we had a grand consultation, which had evidently been arranged and discussed beforehand. A number of the natives gathered round me, and said they wanted to talk. Two of the best Malay scholars helped each other, the rest putting in hints and ideas in their own language. They told me a long rambling story; but, partly owing to their imperfect knowledge of Malay, partly through my ignorance of local terms, and partly through the incoherence of their narrative, I could not make it out very clearly. It was, however, a tradition, and I was glad to find they had anything of the kind. A long time ago, they said, some strangers came to Aru, and came here to Wanumbai, and the chief of the Wanumbai people did not like them, and wanted them to go away, but they would not go, and so it came to fighting, and many Aru men were killed, and some, along with the chief, were taken prisoners, and carried away by the strangers. Some of the speakers, however, said that he was not carried away, but went away in his own boat to escape from the foreigners, and went to the sea and never came back again. But they all believe that the chief and the people that went with him still live in some foreign country; and if they could but find out where, they would send for them to come back again. Now having some vague idea that white men must know every country beyond the sea, they wanted to know if I had met their people in my country or in the sea. They thought they must be there, for they could not imagine where else they could be. They had sought for them everywhere, they said--on the land and in the sea, in the forest and on the mountains, in the air and in the sky, and could not find them; therefore, they must be in my country, and they begged me to tell them, for I must surely know, as I came from across the great sea. I tried to explain to them that their friends could not have reached my country in small boats; and that there were plenty of islands like Aru all about the sea, which they would be sure to find. Besides, as it was so long ago, the chief and all the people must be dead. But they quite laughed at this idea, and said they were sure they were alive, for they had proof of it. And then they told me that a good many years ago, when the speakers were boys, some Wokan men who were out fishing met these lost people in the sea, and spoke to them; and the chief gave the Wokan men a hundred fathoms of cloth to bring to the men of Wanumbai, to show that they were alive and would soon come back to them, but the Wokan men were thieves, and kept the cloth, and they only heard of it afterwards; and when they spoke about it, the Wokan men denied it, and pretended they had not received the cloth;--so they were quite sure their friends were at that time alive and somewhere in the sea. And again, not many years ago, a report came to them that some Bu0gis traders had brought some children of their lost people; so they went to Dobbo to see about it, and the owner of the house, who was now speaking to me, was one who went; but the Bugis roan would not let them see the children, and threatened to kill them if they came into his house. He kept the children shut up in a large box, and when he went away he took them with him. And at the end of each of these stories, they begged me in an imploring tone to tell them if I knew where their chief and their people now were.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0By dint of questioning, I got some account of the strangers who had taken away their people. They said they were wonderfully strong, and each one could kill a great many Aru men; and when they were wounded, however badly, they spit upon the place, and it immediately became well. And they made a great net of rattans, and entangled their prisoners in it, and sunk them in the water; and the next day, when they pulled the net up on shore, they made the drowned men come to life again, and carried them away.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Much more of the same kind was told me, but in so confused and rambling a manner that I could make nothing out of it, till I inquired how long ago it was that all this happened, when they told me that after their people were taken away the Bugis came in their praus to trade in Aru, and to buy tripang and birds\\' nests. It is not impossible that something similar to what they related to me really happened when the early Portuguese discoverers first carne to Aru, and has formed the foundation for a continually increasing accumulation of legend and fable. I have no doubt that to the next generation, or even before, I myself shall be transformed into a magician or a demigod, a worker of miracles, and a being of supernatural knowledge. They already believe that all the animals I preserve will come to life again; and to their children it will be related that they actually did so. An unusual spell of fine weather setting in just at my arrival has made them believe I can control the seasons; and the simple circumstance of my always walking alone in the forest is a wonder and a mystery to them, as well as my asking them about birds and animals I have not yet seen, and showing an acquaintance with their form, colours, and habits. These facts are brought against me when I disclaim knowledge of what they wish me to tell them. \"You must know,\" say they; \"you know everything: you make the fine weather for your men to shoot, and you know all about our birds and our animals as well as we do; and you go alone into the forest and are not afraid.\" Therefore every confession of ignorance on my part is thought to be a blind, a mere excuse to avoid telling them too much. My very writing materials and books are to them weird things; and were I to choose to mystify them by a few simple experiments with lens and magnet, miracles without end would in a few years cluster about me; and future travellers, penetrating to Wanumbai, world h hardly believe that a poor English naturalist, who had resided a few months among them, could have been the original of the supernatural being to whom so many marvels were attributed.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Far some days I had noticed a good deal of excitement, and many strangers came and went armed with spears and cutlasses, bows and shields. I now found there was war near us--two neighbouring villages having a quarrel about some matter of local politics that I could not understand. They told me it was quite a common thing, and that they are rarely without fighting somewhere near. Individual quarrels are taken up by villages and tribes, and the nonpayment of the stipulated price for a wife is one of the most frequent causes of bitterness and bloodshed. One of the war shields was brought me to look at. It was made of rattans and covered with cotton twist, so as to be both light, strong, and very tough. I should think it would resist any ordinary bullet. Abort the middle there was au arm-hole with a shutter or flap over it. This enables the arm to be put through and the bow drawn, while the body and face, up to the eyes, remain protected, which cannot be done if the shield is carried on the arm by loops attached at the back in the ordinary way. A few of the young men from our house went to help their friends, but I could not bear that any of them were hurt, or that there was much hard fighting.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0May 8th. - I had now been six weeks at Wanumbai, but for more than half the time was laid up in the house with ulcerated feet. My stores being nearly exhausted, and my bird and insect boxes full, and having no immediate prospect of getting the use of my legs again, I determined on returning to Dobbo. Birds had lately become rather scarce, and the Paradise birds had not yet become as plentiful as the natives assured me they would be in another month. The Wanumbai people seemed very sorry at my departure; and well they might be, for the shells and insects they picked up on the way to and from their plantations, and the birds the little boys shot with their bows and arrows, kept them all well supplied with tobacco and gambir, besides enabling them to accumulate a stock of beads and coppers for future expenses. The owner of the house was supplied gratis with a little rice, fish, or salt, whenever he asked for it, which I must say was not very often. On parting, I distributed among them my remnant stock of salt and tobacco, and gave my host a flask of arrack, and believe that on the whole my stay with these simple and good-natured people was productive of pleasure and profit to both parties. I fully intended to come back; and had I known that circumstances would have prevented my doing so, shoed have felt some sorrow in leaving a place where I had first seen so many rare and beautiful living things, and bad so fully enjoyed the pleasure which fills the heart of the naturalist when he is so fortunate as to discover a district hitherto unexplored, and where every day brings forth new and unexpected treasures. We loaded our boat in the afternoon, and, starting before daybreak, by the help of a fair wind reached Dobbo late the same evening.\\nTHE ARU ISLANDS - SECOND RESIDENCE AT DOBBO\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(MAY AND JUNE 1857)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0DOBBO was full to overflowing, and I was obliged to  occupy the court-house where the Commissioners hold their sittings. They had now left the island, and I found the situation agreeable, as it was at the end of the village, with a view down the principal street. It was a mere shed, but half of it had a roughly boarded floor, and by putting up a partition and opening a window I made it a very pleasant abode. In one of the boxes I had left in charge of Herr Warzbergen, a colony of small ants had settled and deposited millions of eggs. It was luckily a fine hot day, and by carrying the box some distance from the house, and placing every article in the sunshine for an hour or two, I got rid of them without damage, as they were fortunately a harmless species.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dobbo now presented an animated appearance. Five or six new houses had been added to the street; the praus were all brought round to the western side of the point, where they were hauled up on the beach, and were being caulked and covered with a thick white lime-plaster for the homeward voyage, making them the brightest and cleanest looking things in the place. Most of the small boats had returned from the \"blakang-tana \"(back country), as the side of the islands towards New Guinea is called. Piles of firewood were being heaped up behind the houses; sail-makers and carpenters were busy at work; mother-of-pearl shell was being tied up in bundles, and the black and ugly smoked tripang was having a last exposure to the sun before loading. The spare portion of the crews were employed cutting and squaring timber, and boats from Ceram and Goram were constantly unloading their cargoes of sago-cake for the traders\\' homeward voyage. The fowls, ducks, and goats all looked fat and thriving on the refuse food of a dense population, and the Chinamen\\'s pigs were in a state of obesity that foreboded early death. Parrots and Tories and cockatoos, of a dozen different binds, were suspended on bamboo perches at the doors of the houses, with metallic green or white fruit-pigeons which cooed musically at noon and eventide. Young cassowaries, strangely striped with black and brown, wandered about the houses or gambolled with the playfulness of kittens in the hot sunshine, with sometimes a pretty little kangaroo, caught in the Aru forests, but already tame and graceful as a petted fawn.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Of an evening there were more signs of life than at the time of my former residence. Tom-toms, jews\\'-harps, and even fiddles were to be heard, and the melancholy Malay songs sounded not unpleasantly far into the night. Almost every day there was a cock-fight in the street. The spectators make a ring, and after the long steel spurs are tied on, and the poor animals are set down to gash and kill each other, the excitement is immense. Those who lave made bets scream and yell and jump frantically, if they think they are going to win or lose, but in a very few minutes it is all over; there is a hurrah from the winners, the owners seize their cocks, the winning bird is caressed and admired, the loser is generally dead or very badly wounded, and his master may often be seen plucking out his feathers as he walks away, preparing him for the cooking pot while the poor bird is still alive.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A game at foot-ball, which generally took place at sunset, was, however, much more interesting to me. The ball used is a rather small one, and is made of rattan, hollow, light, and elastic. The player keeps it dancing a little while on his foot, then occasionally on his arm or thigh, till suddenly he gives it a good blow with the hollow of the foot, and sends it flying high in the air. Another player runs to meet it, and at its first bound catches it on his foot and plays in his turn. The ball must never be touched with the hand; but the arm, shoulder, knee, or thigh are used at pleasure to rest the foot. Two or three played very skilfully, keeping the ball continually flying about, but the place was too confined to show off the game to advantage. One evening a quarrel arose from some dispute in the game, and there was a great row, and it was feared there would be a fight about it--not two men only, but a party of a dozen or twenty on each side, a regular battle with knives and krisses; but after a large amount of talk it passed off quietly, and we heard nothing about it afterwards.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Most Europeans being gifted by nature with a luxuriant growth of hair upon their faces, think it disfigures them, and keep up a continual struggle against her by mowing down every morning the crop which has sprouted up flaring the preceding twenty-four hours. Now the men of Mongolian race are, naturally, just as many of us want to he. They mostly pass their lives with faces as smooth and beardless as an infant\\'s. But shaving seems an instinct of the human race; for many of these people, having no hair to take off their faces, shave their heads. Others, however, set resolutely to work to force nature to give them a beard. One of the chief cock-fighters at Dobbo was a Javanese, a sort of master of the ceremonies of the ring, who tied on the spars and acted as backer-up to one of the combatants. This man had succeeded, by assiduous cultivation, in raising a pair of moustaches which were a triumph of art, for they each contained about a dozen hairs more than three inches long, and which, being well greased and twisted, were distinctly visible (when not too far off) as a black thread hanging down on each side of his mouth. But the beard to match was the difficulty, for nature had cruelly refused to give him a rudiment of hair on his chin, and the most talented gardener could not do much if he had nothing to cultivate. But true genius triumphs over difficulties. Although there was no hair proper on the chin; there happened to be, rather on one side of it, a small mole or freckle which contained (as such things frequently do) a few stray hairs. These had been made the most of. They had reached four or five inches in length, and formed another black thread dangling from the left angle of the chin. The owner carried this as if it were something remarkable (as it certainly was); he often felt it affectionately, passed it between his fingers, and was evidently extremely proud of his moustaches and beard!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0One of the most surprising things connected with Aru was the excessive cheapness of all articles of European or native manufacture. We were here two thousand miles beyond Singapore and Batavia, which are themselves emporiums of the \"far east,\" in a place unvisited by, and almost unknown to, European traders; everything reached us through at least two or three hands, often many more; yet English calicoes and American cotton cloths could be bought for 8s. the piece, muskets for 15s., common scissors and German knives at three-halfpence each, and other cutlery, cotton goods, and earthenware in the same proportion. The natives of this out-of-the-way country can, in fact, buy all these things at about the same money price as our workmen at home, but in reality very much cheaper, for the produce of a few hours\\' labour enables the savage to purchase in abundance what are to him luxuries, while to the European they are necessaries of life. The barbarian is no happier and no better off for this cheapness. On the contrary, it has a most injurious effect on him. He wants the stimulus of necessity to force him to labour; and if iron were as dear as silver, and calico as costly as satin, the effect would be beneficial to him. As it is, he has more idle hours, gets a more constant supply of tobacco, and can intoxicate himself with arrack more frequently and more thoroughly; for your Aru man scorns to get half drunk-a tumbler full of arrack is but a slight stimulus, and nothing less than half a gallon of spirit will make him tipsy to his own satisfaction.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is not agreeable to reflect on this state of things. At least half of the vast multitudes of uncivilized peoples, on whom our gigantic manufacturing system, enormous capital, and intense competition force the produce of our looms and workshops, would be not a whit worse off physically, and would certainly be improved morally, if all the articles with which w e supply them were double or treble their present prices. If at the same time the difference of cost, or a large portion of it, could find its way into the pockets of the manufacturing workmen, thousands would be raised from want to comfort, from starvation to health, and would be removed from one of the chief incentives to crime. It is difficult for an Englishman to avoid contemplating with pride our gigantic and ever-increasing manufactures and commerce, and thinking everything good that renders their progress still more rapid, either by lowering the price at which the articles can be produced, or by discovering new markets to which they may be sent. If, however, the question that is so frequently asked of the votaries of the less popular sciences were put here--\"Cui bono?\"--it would be found more difficult to answer than had been imagined. The advantages, even to the few who reap them, would be seen to be mostly physical, while the wide-spread moral and intellectual evils resulting from unceasing labour, low wages, crowded dwellings, and monotonous occupations, to perhaps as large a number as those who gain any real advantage, might be held to show a balance of evil so great, as to lead the greatest admirers of our manufactures and commerce to doubt the advisability of their further development. It will be said: \"We cannot stop it;  capital must be employed; our population must be kept at work; if we hesitate a moment, other nations now hard pressing us will get ahead, and national ruin will follow.\" Some of this is true, some fallacious. It is undoubtedly a difficult problem which we have to solve; and I am inclined to think it is this difficulty that makes men conclude that what seems a necessary and unalterable state of things must be good-that its benefits must he greater than its evils. This was the feeling of the American advocates of slavery; they could not see an easy, comfortable way out of it. In our own case, however, it is to be hoped, that if a fair consideration of the matter in all its hearings shows that a preponderance of evil arises from the immensity of our manufactures and commerce-evil which must go on increasing with their increase-there is enough both of political wisdom and true philanthropy in Englishmen, to induce them to turn their superabundant wealth into other channels. The fact that has led to these remarks is surely a striking one: that in one of the most remote corners of the earth savages can buy clothing cheaper than the people of the country where it is made; that the weaver\\'s child should shiver in the wintry wind, unable to purchase articles attainable by the wild natives of a tropical climate, where clothing is mere ornament or luxury, should make us pause ere we regard with unmixed admiration the system which has led to such a result, and cause us to look with some suspicion on the further extension of that system. It must be remembered too that our commerce is not a purely natural growth. It has been ever fostered by the legislature, and forced to an unnatural luxuriance by the protection of our fleets and armies. The wisdom and the justice of this policy have been already doubted. So soon, therefore, as it is seen that the further extension of our manufactures and commerce would be an evil, the remedy is not far to seek.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After six weeks\\' confinement to the house I was at length well, and could resume my daily walks in the forest. I did not, however, find it so productive as when I had first arrived at Dobbo. There was a damp stagnation about the paths, and insects were very scarce. In some of my best collecting places I now found a mass of rotting wood, mingled with young shoots, and overgrown with climbers, yet I always managed to add something daily to my extensive collections. I one day met with a curious example of failure of instinct, which, by showing it to be fallible, renders it very doubtful whether it is anything more than hereditary habit, dependent on delicate modifications of sensation. Some sailors cut down a good-sized tree, and, as is always my practice, I visited it daily for some time in search of insects. Among other beetles came swarms of the little cylindrical woodborers (Platypus, Tesserocerus, &c.), and commenced making holes in the bark. After a day or two I was surprised to find hundreds of them sticking in the holes they had bored, and on examination discovered that the milky sap of the tree was of the nature of gutta-percha, hardening rapidly on exposure to the air, and glueing the little animals in self-dug graves. The habit of boring holes in trees in which to deposit their eggs, was not accompanied by a sufficient instinctive knowledge of which trees were suitable, and which destructive to them. If, as is very probable, these trees have an attractive odour to certain species of borers, it might very likely lead to their becoming extinct; while other species, to whom the same odour was disagreeable, and who therefore avoided the dangerous trees, would survive, and would be credited by us with an instinct, whereas they would really be guided by a simple sensation.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Those curious little beetles, the Brenthidae, were very abundant in Aru. The females have a pointed rostrum, with which they bore deep holes in the bark of dead trees, often burying the rostrum up to the eyes, and in these holes deposit their eggs. The males are larger, and have the rostrum dilated at the end, and sometimes terminating in a good-sized pair of jaws. I once saw two males fighting together; each had a fore-leg laid across the neck of the other, and the rostrum bent quite in an attitude of defiance, and looking most ridiculous. Another time, two were fighting for a female, who stood close by busy at her boring. They pushed at each other with their rostra, and clawed and thumped, apparently in the greatest rage, although their coats of mail must have saved both from injury. The small one, however, soon ran away, acknowledging himself vanquished. In most Coleoptera the female is larger than the male, and it is therefore interesting, as bearing on the question of sexual selection, that in this case, as in the stag-beetles where the males fight together, they should be not only better armed, but also much larger than the females. Just as we were going away, a handsome tree, allied to Erythrina, was in blossom, showing its masses of large crimson flowers scattered here and there about the forest. Could it have been seen from an elevation, it would have had a fine effect; from below I could only catch sight of masses of gorgeous colour in clusters and festoons overhead, about which flocks of blue and orange lories were fluttering and screaming.\\nMALE BRENTHIDAE (Leptorhynchus angustasus) FIGHTING\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A good many people died at Dobbo this season; I believe about twenty. They were buried in a little grove of Casuarinas behind my house. Among the traders was a. Mahometan priest, who superintended the funerals, which were very simple. The body was wrapped up in new white cotton cloth, and was carried on a bier to the grave. All the spectators sat down on the ground, and the priest chanted some verses from the Koran. The graves were fenced round with a slight bamboo railing, and a little carved wooden head-post was put to mark the spot. There was also in the village a small mosque, where every Friday the faithful went to pray. This is probably more remote from Mecca than any other mosque in the world, and marks the farthest eastern extension of the Mahometan religion. The Chinese here, as elsewhere, showed their superior wealth and civilization by tombstones of solid granite brought from Singapore, with deeply-cut inscriptions, the characters of which are painted in red, blue, and gold. No people have more respect for the graves of their relations and friends than this strange, ubiquitous, money-getting people.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Soon after we had returned to Dobbo, my Macassar boy, Baderoon, took his wages and left me, because I scolded him for laziness. He then occupied himself in gambling, and at first had some luck, and bought ornaments, and had plenty of money. Then his luck turned; he lost everything, borrowed money and lost that, and was obliged to become the slave of his creditor till he had worked out the debt. He was a quick and active lad when he pleased, but was apt to be idle, and had such an incorrigible propensity for gambling, that it will very likely lead to his becoming a slave for life.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The end of June was now approaching, the east monsoon had set in steadily, and in another week or two Dobbo would be deserted. Preparations for departure were everywhere visible, and every sunny day (rather rare now) the streets were as crowded and as busy as beehives. Heaps of tripang were finally dried and packed up in sacks; mother-of-pearl shell, tied up with rattans into convenient bundles, was all day long being carried to the beach to be loaded; water-casks were filled, and cloths and mat-sails mended and strengthened for the run home before the strong east wind. Almost every day groups of natives arrived from the most distant parts of the islands, with cargoes of bananas and sugar- cane to exchange for tobacco, sago, bread, and other luxuries, before the general departure. The Chinamen killed their fat pig and made their parting feast, and kindly sent me some pork, and a basin of birds\\' nest stew, which had very little more taste than a dish of vermicelli. My boy Ali returned from Wanumbai, where I had sent him alone for a fortnight to buy Paradise birds and prepare the skins; he brought me sixteen glorious specimens, and had he not been very ill with fever and ague might have obtained twice the number. He had lived with the people whose house I had occupied, and it is a proof of their goodness, if fairly treated, that although he took with him a quantity of silver dollars to pay for the birds they caught, no attempt was made to rob him, which might have been done with the most perfect impunity. He was kindly treated when ill, and was brought back to me with the balance of the dollars he had not spent.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Wanumbai people, like almost all the inhabitants of the Aru Islands, are perfect savages, and I saw no signs of any religion. There are, however, three or four villages on the coast where schoolmasters from Amboyna reside, and the people are nominally Christians, and are to some extent educated and civilized. I could not get much real knowledge of the customs of the Aru people during the short time I was among them, but they have evidently been considerably influenced by their long association with Mahometan traders. They often bury their dead, although the national custom is to expose the body an a raised stage till it decomposes. Though there is no limit to the number of wives a man may have, they seldom exceed one or two. A wife is regularly purchased from the parents, the price being a large assortment of articles, always including gongs, crockery, and cloth. They told me that some of the tribes kill the old men and women when they can no longer work, but I saw many very old and decrepid people, who seemed pretty well attended to. No doubt all who have much intercourse with the Bugis and Ceramese traders gradually lose many of their native customs, especially as these people often settle in their villages and marry native women.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The trade carried on at Dobbo is very considerable. This year there were fifteen large praus from Macassar, and perhaps a hundred small boats from Ceram, Goram, and Ke. The Macassar cargoes are worth about £1,000. each, and the other boats take away perhaps about £3,000, worth, so that the whole exports may be estimated at £18,000. per annum. The largest and most bulky items are pearl-shell and tripang, or \"beche-de-mer,\" with smaller quantities of tortoise-shell, edible birds\\' nests, pearls, ornamental woods, timber, and Birds of Paradise. These are purchased with a variety of goods. Of arrack, about equal in strength to ordinary West India rum, 3,000 boxes, each containing fifteen half-gallon bottles, are consumed annually. Native cloth from Celebes is much esteemed for its durability, and large quantities are sold, as well as white English calico and American unbleached cottons, common crockery, coarse cutlery, muskets, gunpowder, gongs, small brass cannon, and elephants\\' tusks. These three last articles constitute the wealth of the Aru people, with which they pay for their wives, or which they hoard up as \"real property.\" Tobacco is in immense demand for chewing, and it must be very strong, or an Aru man will not look at it. Knowing how little these people generally work, the mass of produce obtained annually shows that the islands must be pretty thickly inhabited, especially along the coasts, as nine-tenths of the whole are marine productions.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It was on the 2d of July that we left Aru, followed by all the Macassar praus, fifteen in number, who had agreed to sail in company. We passed south of Banda,  and then steered due west, not seeing land for three days, till we sighted some low islands west of Bouton. We had a strong and steady south-east wind day and night, which carried us on at about five knots an hour, where a clipper ship would have made twelve. The sky was continually cloudy, dark, and threatening, with occasional drizzling showers, till we were west of Bouru, when it cleared up and we enjoyed the bright sunny skies of the dry season for the rest of our voyage. It is about here, therefore that the seasons of the eastern and western regions of the Archipelago are divided. West of this line from June to December is generally fine, and often very dry, the rest of the year being the wet season. East of it the weather is exceedingly uncertain, each island, and each side of an island, having its own peculiarities. The difference seems to consist not so much in the distribution of the rainfall as in that of the clouds and the moistness of the atmosphere. In Aru, for example, when we left, the little streams were all dried up, although the weather was gloomy; while in January, February, and March, when we had the hottest sunshine and the finest days, they were always flowing. The driest time of all the year in Aru occurs in September and October, just as it does in Java and Celebes. The rainy seasons agree, therefore, with those of the western islands, although the weather is very different. The Molucca sea is of a very deep blue colour, quite distinct from the clear light blue of the Atlantic. In cloudy and dull weather it looks absolutely black, and when crested with foam has a stern and angry aspect. The wind continued fair and strong during our whole voyage, and we reached Macassar in perfect safety on the evening of the 11th of July, having made the passage from Aru (more than a thousand miles) in nine and a half days.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My expedition to the Aru Islands had been eminently successful. Although I had been for months confined to the house by illness, and had lost much time by the want of the means of locomotion, and by missing the right season at the right place, I brought away with me more than nine thousand specimens of natural objects, of about sixteen hundred distinct species. I had made the acquaintance of a strange and little-known race of men; I had become familiar with the traders of the far East; I had revelled in the delights of exploring a new fauna and flora, one of the most remarkable and most beautiful and least-known in the world; and I had succeeded in the main object for which I had undertaken the journey-namely, to obtain fine specimens of the magnificent Birds of Paradise, and to be enabled to observe them in their native forests. By this success I was stimulated to continue my researches in the Moluccas and New Guinea for nearly five years longer, and it is still the portion of my travels to which I look back with the most complete satisfaction.\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\nTHE ARU ISLANDS - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND ASPECTS OF NATURE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0IN this chapter I propose to give a general sketch of the physical geography of the Aru Islands, and of their relation to the surrounding countries; and shall thus be able to incorporate the information obtained from traders, and from the works of other naturalists with my own observations in these exceedingly interesting and little-known regions.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Aru group may be said to consist of one very large central island with a number of small ones scattered round it. The great island is called by the natives and traders \"Tang-busar\" (great or mainland), to distinguish it as a whole from Dobbo, or any of the detached islands. It is of an irregular oblong form, about eighty miles from north to south, and forty or fifty from east to west, in which direction it is traversed by three narrow channels, dividing it into four portions. These channels are always called rivers by the traders, which puzzled me much till I passed through one of them, and saw how exceedingly applicable the name was. The northern channel, called the river of Watelai, is about a quarter of a mile wide at its entrance, but soon narrows to abort the eighth of a mile, which width it retains, with little variation, during its whole, length of nearly fifty miles, till it again widens at its eastern mouth. Its course is moderately winding, and the hanks are generally dry and somewhat elevated. In many places there are low cliffs of hard coralline limestone, more or less worn by the action of water; while sometimes level spaces extend from the banks to low ranges of hills a little inland. A few small streams enter it from right and left, at the mouths of which are some little rocky islands. The depth is very regular, being from ten to fifteen fathoms, and it has thus every feature of a true river, but for the salt water and the absence of a current. The other two rivers, whose names are Vorkai and Maykor, are said to be very similar in general character; but they are rather near together, and have a number of cross channels intersecting the flat tract between them. On the south side of Maykor the banks are very rocky, and from thence to the southern extremity of Aru is an uninterrupted extent of rather elevated and very rocky country, penetrated by numerous small streams, in the high limestone cliffs bordering which the edible birds\\' nests of Aru are chiefly obtained. All my informants stated that the two southern rivers are larger than Watelai.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The whole of Aru is low, but by no means so flat as it has been represented, or as it appears from the sea. Most of it is dry rocky ground, with a somewhat undulating surface, rising here and there into abrupt hillocks, or cut into steep and narrow ravines. Except the patches of swamp which are found at the mouths of most of the small rivers, there is no absolutely level ground, although the greatest elevation is probably not more than two hundred feet. The rock which everywhere appears in the ravines and brooks is a coralline limestone, in some places soft and pliable, in others so hard and crystalline as to resemble our mountain limestone.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The small islands which surround the central mass are very numerous; but most of them are on the east side, where they form a fringe, often extending ten or fifteen miles from the main islands. On the west there are very few, Wamma and Palo Pabi being the chief, with Ougia, and Wassia at the north-west extremity. On the east side the sea is everywhere shallow, and full of coral; and it is here that the pearl-shells are found which form one of the chief staples of Aru trade. All the islands are covered with a dense and very lofty forest.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The physical features here described are of peculiar interest, and, as far as I am aware, are to some extent unique; for I have been unable to find any other record of an island of the size of Aru crossed by channels which exactly resemble true rivers. How these channels originated were a complete puzzle to me, till, after a long consideration of the whole of the natural phenomena presented by these islands, I arrived at a conclusion which I will now endeavour to explain. There are three ways in which we may conceive islands which are not volcanic to have been formed, or to have been reduced to their present condition, by elevation, by subsidence, or by separation from a continent or larger island. The existence of coral rock, or of raised beaches far inland, indicates recent elevation; lagoon coral-islands, and such as have barrier or encircling reefs, have suffered subsidence; while our own islands, whose productions are entirely those of the adjacent continent, have been separated from it. Now the Aru Islands are all coral rock, and the adjacent sea is shallow and full of coral, it is therefore evident that they have been elevated from beneath the ocean at a not very distant epoch. But if we suppose that elevation to be the first and only cause of their present condition, we shall find ourselves quite unable to explain the curious river-channels which divide them. Fissures during upheaval would not produce the regular width, the regular depth, or the winding curves which characterise them; and the action of tides and currents during their elevation might form straits of irregular width and depth, but not the river-like channels which actually exist. If, again, we suppose the last movement to have been one of subsidence, reducing the size of the islands, these channels are quite as inexplicable; for subsidence would necessarily lead to the flooding of all low tracts on the banks of the old rivers, and thus obliterate their courses; whereas these remain perfect, and of nearly uniform width from end to end.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Now if these channels have ever been rivers they must have flowed from some higher regions, and this must have been to the east, because on the north and west the sea-bottom sinks down at a short distance from the shore to an unfathomable depth; whereas on the east. a shallow sea, nowhere exceeding fifty fathoms, extends quite across to New Guinea, a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles. An elevation of only three hundred feet would convert the whole of this sea into moderately high land, and make the Aru Islands a portion of New Guinea; and the rivers which have their mouths at Utanata and Wamuka, might then have flowed on across Aru, in the channels which are now occupied by salt water. Then the intervening land sunk down, we must suppose the land that now constitutes Aru to have remained nearly stationary, a not very improbable supposition, when we consider the great extent of the shallow sea, and the very small amount of depression the land need have undergone to produce it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But the fact of the Aru Islands having once been connected with New Guinea does not rest on this evidence alone. There is such a striking resemblance between the productions of the two countries as only- exists between portions of a common territory. I collected one hundred species of land-birds in the Aru Islands, and about eighty of them, have been found on the mainland of New Guinea. Among these are the great wingless cassowary, two species of heavy brush turkeys, and two of short winged thrushes; which could certainly not have passed over the 150 miles of open sea to the coast of New Guinea. This barrier is equally effectual in the case of many other birds which live only in the depths of the forest, as the kinghunters (Dacelo gaudichaudi), the fly-catching wrens (Todopsis), the great crown pigeon (Goura coronata), and the small wood doves (Ptilonopus perlatus, P. aurantiifrons, and P. coronulatus). Now, to show the real effect of such barrier, let us take the island of Ceram, which is exactly the same distance from New Guinea, but separated from it by a deep sea. Cut of about seventy land-birds inhabiting Ceram, only fifteen are found in New Guinea, and none of these are terrestrial or forest-haunting species. The cassowary is distinct; the kingfishers, parrots, pigeons, flycatchers, honeysuckers, thrushes, and cuckoos, are almost always quite distinct species. More than this, at least twenty genera, which are common to New Guinea and Aru, do not extend into Ceram, indicating with a force which every naturalist will appreciate, that the two latter countries have received their faunas in a radically different manner. Again, a true kangaroo is found in Aru, and the same species occurs in Mysol, which is equally Papuan in its productions, while either the same, or one closely allied to it, inhabits New Guinea; but no such animal is found in Ceram, which is only sixty miles from Mysol. Another small marsupial animal (Perameles doreyanus) is common to Aru and New Guinea. The insects show exactly the same results. The butterflies of Aru are all either New Guinea species, or very slightly modified forms; whereas those of Ceram are more distinct than are the birds of the two countries.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is now generally admitted that we may safely reason on such facts as those, which supply a link in the defective geological record. The upward and downward movements which any country has undergone, and the succession of such movements, can be determined with much accuracy; but geology alone can tell us nothing of lands which have entirely disappeared beneath the ocean. Here physical geography and the distribution of animals and plants are of the greatest service. By ascertaining the depth of the seas separating one country from another, we can form some judgment of the changes which are taking place. If there are other evidences of subsidence, a shallow sea  implies a former connexion of the adjacent lands; but i£ this evidence is wanting, or if there is reason to suspect a rising of the land, then the shallow sea may be the result of that rising, and may indicate that the two countries will be joined at some future time, but not that they have previously been so. The nature of the animals and plants inhabiting these countries will, however, almost always enable us to determine this question. Mr. Darwin has shown us how we may determine in almost every case, whether an island has ever been connected with a continent or larger land, by the presence or absence of terrestrial Mammalia and reptiles. What he terms \"oceanic islands \"possess neither of these groups of animals, though they may have a luxuriant vegetation, and a fair number of birds, insects, and landshells; and we therefore conclude that they have originated in mid-ocean, and have never been connected with the nearest masses of land. St. Helena, Madeira, and New Zealand are examples of oceanic islands. They possess all other classes of life, because these have means of dispersion over wide spaces of sea, which terrestrial mammals and birds have not, as is fully explained in Sir Charles Lyell\\'s \"Principles of Geology,\" and Mr. Darwin\\'s \"Origin of Species.\" On the other hand, an island may never have been actually connected with the adjacent continents or islands, and yet may possess representatives of all classes of animals, because many terrestrial mammals and some reptiles have the means of passing over short distances of sea. But in these cases the number of species that have thus migrated will be very small, and there will be great deficiencies even in birds and flying insects, which we should imagine could easily cross over. The island of Timor (as I have already shown in Chapter XIII) bears this relation to Australia; for while it contains several birds and insects of Australian forms, no Australian mammal or reptile is found in it, and a great number of the most abundant and characteristic forms of Australian birds and insects are entirely absent. Contrast this with the British Islands, in, which a large proportion of the plants, insects, reptiles, and Mammalia of the adjacent parts of the continent are fully represented, while there are no remarkable deficiencies of extensive groups, such as always occur when there is reason to believe there has been no such connexion. The case of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java, and the Asiatic continent is equally clear; many large Mammalia, terrestrial birds, and reptiles being common to all, while a large number more are of closely allied forms. Now, geology has taught us that this representation by allied forms in the same locality implies lapse of time, and we therefore infer that in Great Britain, where almost every species is absolutely identical with those on the Continent, the separation has been very recent; while in Sumatra and Java, where a considerable number of the continental species are represented by allied forms, the separation was more remote.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0From these examples we may see how important a supplement to geological evidence is the study of the geographical distribution of animals and plants, in determining the former condition of the earth\\'s surface; and how impossible it is to understand the former without taking the latter into account. The productions of the Aru Islands offer the strangest evidence, that at no very distant epoch they formed a part of New Guinea; and the peculiar physical features which I have described, indicate that they must have stood at very nearly the same level then as they do now, having been separated by the subsidence of the great plain which formerly connected them with it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Persons who have formed the usual ideas of the vegetation of the tropics who picture to themselves the abundance and brilliancy of the flowers, and the magnificent appearance of hundreds of forest trees covered with masses of coloured blossoms, will be surprised to hear, that though vegetation in Aru is highly luxuriant and varied, and would afford abundance of fine and curious plants to adorn our hothouses, yet bright and showy flowers are, as a general rule, altogether absent, or so very scarce as to produce no effect whatever on the general scenery. To give particulars: I have visited five distinct localities in the islands, I have wandered daily in the forests, and have passed along upwards of a hundred miles of coast and river during a period of six months, much of it very fine weather, and till just as I was about to leave, I never saw a single plant of striking brilliancy or beauty, hardly a shrub equal to a hawthorn, or a climber equal to a honeysuckle! It cannot be said that the flowering season had not arrived, for I saw many herbs, shrubs, and forest trees in flower, but all had blossoms of a green or greenish-white tint, not superior to our lime-trees. Here and there on the river banks and coasts are a few Convolvulaceae, not equal to our garden Ipomaeas, and in the deepest shades of the forest some fine scarlet and purple Zingiberaceae, but so few and scattered as to be nothing amid the mass of green and flowerless vegetation. Yet the noble Cycadaceae and screw-pines, thirty or forty feet high, the elegant tree ferns, the lofty palms, and the variety of beautiful and curious plants which everywhere meet the eye, attest the warmth and moisture of the tropics, and the fertility of the soil.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is true that Aru seemed to me exceptionally poor in flowers, but this is only an exaggeration of a general tropical feature; for my whole experience in the equatorial regions of the west and the east has convinced me, that in the most luxuriant parts of the tropics, flowers are less abundant, on the average less showy, and are far less effective in adding colour to the landscape than in temperate climates. I have never seen in the tropics such brilliant masses of colour as even England can show in her furze-clad commons, her heathery mountain-sides, her glades of wild hyacinths, her fields of poppies, her meadows of buttercups and orchises--carpets of yellow, purple, azure-blue, and fiery crimson, which the tropics can rarely exhibit. We, have smaller masses of colour in our hawthorn and crab trees, our holly and mountain-ash, our boom; foxgloves, primroses, and purple vetches, which clothe with gay colours the whole length and breadth of our land, These beauties are all common. They are characteristic of the country and the climate; they have not to be sought for, but they gladden the eye at every step. In the regions of the equator, on the other hand, whether it be forest or savannah, a sombre green clothes universal nature. You may journey for hours, and even for days, and meet with nothing to break the monotony. Flowers are everywhere rare, and anything at all striking is only to be met with at very distant intervals.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The idea that nature exhibits gay colours in the tropics, and that the general aspect of nature is there more bright and varied in hue than with us, has even been made the foundation of theories of art, and we have been forbidden to use bright colours in our garments, and in the decorations of our dwellings, because it was supposed that we should be thereby acting in opposition to the teachings of nature. The argument itself is a very poor one, since it might with equal justice be maintained, that as we possess faculties for the appreciation of colours, we should make up for the deficiencies of nature and use the gayest tints in those regions where the landscape is most monotonous. But the assumption on which the argument is founded is totally false, so that even if the reasoning were valid, we need not be afraid of outraging nature, by decorating our houses and our persons with all those gay hues which are so lavishly spread over our fields and mountains, our hedges, woods, and meadows.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is very easy to see what has led to this erroneous view of the nature of tropical vegetation. In our hothouses and at our flower-shows we gather together the finest flowering plants from the most distant regions of the earth, and exhibit them in a proximity to each other which never occurs in nature. A hundred distinct plants, all with bright, or strange, or gorgeous flowers, make a wonderful show when brought together; but perhaps no two of these plants could ever be seen together in a state of nature, each inhabiting a distant region or a different station. Again, all moderately warm extra-European countries are mixed up with the tropics in general estimation, and a vague idea is formed that whatever is preeminently beautiful must come from the hottest parts of the earth. But the fact is quite the contrary. Rhododendrons and azaleas are plants of temperate regions, the grandest lilies are from temperate Japan, and a large proportion of our most showy flowering plants are natives of the Himalayas, of the Cape, of the United States, of Chili, or of China and Japan, all temperate regions. True, there are a great number of grand and gorgeous flowers in the tropics, but the proportion they bear to the mass of the vegetation is exceedingly small; so that what appears an anomaly is nevertheless a fact, and the effect of flowers on the general aspect of nature is far less in the equatorial than in the temperate regions of the earth.\\nNEW GUINEA - DOREY\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(MARCH TO JULY 1858)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0AFTER my return from Gilolo to Ternate, in March 1858, I made arrangements for my long-wished-for voyage to the mainland of New Guinea, where I anticipated that my collections would surpass those which I had formed at the Aru Islands. The poverty of Ternate in articles used by Europeans was shown, by my searching in vain through all the stores for such common things as flour, metal spoons, wide-mouthed phials, beeswax, a penknife, and a stone or metal pestle and mortar. I took with me four servants: my head man Ali, and a Ternate lad named Jumaat (Friday), to shoot; Lahagi, a steady middle-aged man, to cut timber and assist me in insect-collecting; and Loisa, a Javanese cook. As I knew I should have to build a house at Dorey, where I was going, I took with me eighty cadjans, or waterproof mats, made of pandanus leaves, to cover over my baggage on first landing, and to help to roof my house afterwards.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We started on the 25th of March in the schooner Hester Helena, belonging to my friend Mr. Duivenboden, and bound on a trading voyage along the north coast of New Guinea. Having calms and light airs, we were three days reaching Gane, near the south end of Gilolo, where we stayed to fill. up our water-casks and buy a few provisions. We obtained fowls, eggs, sago, plantains, sweet potatoes, yellow pumpkins, chilies, fish, and dried deer\\'s meat; and on the afternoon of the 29th proceeded on our voyage to Dorey harbour. We found it, however, by no means easy to get along; for so near to the equator the monsoons entirely fail of their regularity, and after passing the southern point of Gilolo we had calms, light puffs of wind, and contrary currents, which kept us for five days in sight of the same islands between it and Poppa. A squall them brought us on to the entrance of Dampier\\'s Straits, where we were again becalmed, and were three more days creeping through them. Several native canoes now came off to us from Waigiou on one side, and Batanta on the other, bringing a few common shells, palm-leaf mats, cocoa-nuts, and pumpkins. They were very extravagant in their demands, being accustomed to sell their trifles to whalers and China ships, whose crews will purchase anything at ten times its value. My only purchases were a float belonging to a turtle-spear, carved to resemble a bird, and a very well made palm-leaf box, for which articles I gave a copper ring and a yard of calico. The canoes were very narrow and furnished with an outrigger, and in some of them there was only one man, who seemed to think nothing of coming out alone eight or ten miles from shore. The people were Papuans, much resembling the natives of Aru.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When we had got out of the Straits, and were fairly in the great Pacific Ocean, we had a steady wind for the first time since leaving Ternate, but unfortunately it was dead ahead, and we had to beat against it, tacking on and off the coast of New Guinea. I looked with intense interest on those rugged mountains, retreating ridge behind ridge into the interior, where the foot of civilized man had never trod. There was the country of the cassowary and the tree-kangaroo, and those dark forests produced the most extraordinary and the most beautiful of the feathered inhabitants of the earth--the varied species of Birds of Paradise. A few days more and I hoped to be in pursuit of these, and of the scarcely less beautiful insects which accompany them. We had still, however, for several days only calms and light head-winds, and it was not till the l0th of April that a fine westerly breeze set in, followed by a squally night, which kept us off the entrance of Dorey harbour. The next morning we entered, and came to anchor off the small island of Mansinam, on which dwelt two German missionaries, Messrs. Otto and Geisler. The former immediately came on board to give us welcome, and invited us to go on shore and breakfast with him. We were then introduced to his companion who was suffering dreadfully from an abscess on the heel, which had confined him to the house for six months--and to his wife, a young German woman, who had been out only three months. Unfortunately she could speak no Malay or English, and had to guess at our compliments on her excellent breakfast by the justice we did to it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0These missionaries were working men, and had been sent out, as being more useful among savages than persons of a higher class. They had been here about two years, and Mr. Otto had already learnt to speak the Papuan language with fluency, and had begun translating some portions of the Bible. The language, however, is so poor that a considerable number of Malay words have to be used; and it is very questionable whether it is possible to convey any idea of such a book, to a people in so low a state of civilization. The only nominal converts yet made are a few of the women; and some few of the children attend school, and are being taught to read, but they make little progress. There is one feature of this mission which I believe will materially interfere with its moral effect. The missionaries are allowed to trade to eke out the very small salaries granted them from Europe, and of course are obliged to carry out the trade principle of buying cheap and selling dear, in order to make a profit. Like all savages the natives are quite careless of the future, and when their small rice crops are gathered they bring a large portion of it to the missionaries, and sell it for knives, beads, axes, tobacco, or any other articles they may require. A few months later, in the wet season, when food is scarce, they come to buy it back again, and give in exchange tortoiseshell, tripang, wild nutmegs, or other produce. Of course the rice is sold at a much higher rate than it was bought, as is perfectly fair and just -- and the operation is on the whole thoroughly beneficial to the natives, who would otherwise consume and waste their food when it was abundant, and then starve -- yet I cannot imagine that the natives see it in this light. They must look upon the trading missionaries with some suspicion, and cannot feel so sure of their teachings being disinterested, as would be the case if they acted like the Jesuits in Singapore. The first thing to be done by the missionary in attempting to improve savages, is to convince them by his actions that he comes among them for their benefit only, and not for any private ends of his own. To do this he must act in a different way from other men, not trading and taking advantage of the necessities of those who want to sell, but rather giving to those who are in distress. It would he well if he conformed himself in some degree to native customs, and then endeavoured to show how these customs might be gradually modified, so as to be more healthful and more agreeable. A few energetic and devoted men acting in this way might probably effect a decided moral improvement on the lowest savage tribes, whereas trading missionaries, teaching what Jesus said, but not doing as He did, can scarcely be expected to do more than give them a very little of the superficial varnish of religion.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dorey harbour is in a fine bay, at one extremity of which an elevated point juts out, and, with two or three small islands, forms a sheltered anchorage. The only vessel it contained when we arrived was a Dutch brig, laden with coals for the use of a war- steamer, which was expected daily, on an exploring expedition along the coasts of New Guinea, for the purpose of fixing on a locality for a colony. In the evening we paid it a visit, and landed at the village of Dorey, to look out for a place where I could build my house. Mr. Otto also made arrangements for me with some of the native chiefs, to send men to cut wood, rattans, and bamboo the next day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The villages of Mansinam and Dorey presented some features quite new to me. The houses all stand completely in the water, and are reached by long rude bridges. They are very low, with the roof shaped like a large boat, bottom upwards. The posts which support the houses, bridges, and platforms are small crooked sticks, placed without any regularity, and looking as if they were tumbling down. The floors are also formed of sticks, equally irregular, and so loose and far apart that I found it almost impossible to walls on them. The walls consist of bits of boards, old boats, rotten mats, attaps, and palm-leaves, stuck in anyhow here and there, and having altogether the most wretched and dilapidated appearance it is possible to conceive. Under the eaves of many of the houses hang human skulls, the trophies of their battles with the savage Arfaks of the interior, who often come to attack them. A large boat-shaped council-house is supported on larger posts, each of which is grossly carved to represent a naked male or female human figure, and other carvings still more revolting are placed upon the platform before the entrance. The view of an ancient lake-dweller\\'s village, given as the frontispiece of Sir Charles Lyell\\'s \"Antiquity of Man,\" is chiefly founded on a sketch of this very village of Dorey; but the extreme regularity of the structures there depicted has no place in the original, any more than it probably had in the actual lake-villages.\\nPAPUAN, NEW GUINEA\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The people who inhabit these miserable huts are very similar to the Ké and Aru islanders, and many of them are very handsome, being tall and well-made, with well-cut features and large aquiline noses. Their colour is a deep brown, often approaching closely to black, and the fine mop-like heads of frizzly hair appear to be more common than elsewhere, and are considered a great ornament, a long six-pronged bamboo fork being kept stuck in them to serve the purpose of a comb; and this is assiduously used at idle moments to keep the densely growing mass from becoming matted and tangled. The majority have short woolly hair, which does not seem capable of an equally luxuriant development. A growth of hair somewhat similar to this, and almost as abundant, is found among the half-breeds between the Indian and Negro in South America. Can this be an indication that the Papuans are a mixed race?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0For the first three days after our arrival I was fully occupied from morning to night building a house, with the assistance of a dozen Papuans and my own men. It was immense trouble to get our labourers to work, as scarcely one of them could speak a word of Malay; and it was only by the most energetic gesticulations, and going through a regular pantomime of what was wanted, that we could get them to do anything. If we made them understand that a few more poles were required, which two could have easily cut, six or eight would insist upon going together, although we needed their assistance in other things. One morning ten of them came to work, bringing only one chopper between them, although they knew I had none ready for use.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I chose a place about two hundred yards from the beach, on an elevated ground, by the side of the chief path from the village of Dorey to the provision-grounds and the forest. Within twenty yards was a little stream; which furnished us with excellent water and a nice place to bathe. There was only low underwood to clear away, while some fine forest trees stood at a short distance, and we cut down the wood for about twenty yards round to give us light and air. The house, about twenty feet by fifteen; was built entirely of wood, with a bamboo floor, a single door of thatch, and a large window, looking over the sea, at which I fixed my table, and close beside it my bed, within a little partition. I bought a number of very large palm-leaf mats of the natives, which made excellent walls; while the mats I had brought myself were used on the roof, and were covered over with attaps as soon as we could get them made. Outside, and rather behind, was a little hut, used for cooking, and a bench, roofed over, where my men could sit to skin birds and animals. When all was finished, I had my goods and stores brought up, arranged them conveniently inside, and then paid my Papuans with knives and choppers, and sent them away. The next day our schooner left for the more eastern islands, and I found myself fairly established as the only European inhabitant of the vast island of New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As we had some doubt about the natives, we slept at first with loaded guns beside us and a watch set; but after a few days, finding the people friendly, and feeling sure that they would not venture to attack five well-armed men, we took no further precautions. We had still a day or two\\'s work in finishing up the house, stopping leaks, putting up our hanging shelves for drying specimens inside and out, and making the path down to the water, and a clear dry space in front of the horse.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 17th, the steamer not having arrived, the coal-ship left, having lain here a month, according to her contract; and on the same day my hunters went out to shoot for the first time, and brought home a magnificent crown pigeon and a few common birds. The next day they were more successful, and I was delighted to see them return with a Bird of Paradise in full plumage, a pair of the fine Papuan lories (Lorius domicella), four other lories and parroquets, a grackle (Gracula dumonti), a king-hunter (Dacelo gaudichaudi), a racquet-tailed kingfisher (Tanysiptera galatea), and two or three other birds of less beauty.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I went myself to visit the native village on the hill behind Dorey, and took with me a small present of cloth, knives, and beads, to secure the good-will of the chief, and get him to send some men to catch or shoot birds for me. The houses were scattered about among rudely cultivated clearings. Two which I visited consisted of a central passage, on each side of which opened short passages, admitting to two rooms, each of which was a house accommodating a separate family. They were elevated at least fifteen feet above the ground, on a complete forest of poles, and were so rude and dilapidated that some of the small passages had openings in the floor of loose sticks, through which a child might fall. The inhabitants seemed rather uglier than those at Dorey village. They are, no doubt, the true indigenes of this part of New Guinea, living in the interior, and subsisting by cultivation and hunting. The Dorey men, on the other hand, are shore-dwellers, fishers and traders in a small way, and have thus the character of a colony who have migrated from another district. These hillmen or \"Arfaks \"differed much in physical features. They were generally black, but some were brown like Malays. Their hair, though always more or less frizzly, was sometimes short and matted, instead of being long, loose, and woolly; and this seemed to be a constitutional difference, not the effect of care and cultivation. Nearly half of them were afflicted with the scurfy skin-disease. The old chief seemed much pleased with his present, and promised (through an interpreter I brought with me) to protect my men when they came there shooting, and also to procure me some birds and animals. While conversing, they smoked tobacco of their own growing, in pipes cut from a single piece of wood with a long upright handle.\\nPAPUAN PIPE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We had arrived at Dorey about the end of the wet season, when the whole country was soaked with moisture The native paths were so neglected as to be often mere tunnels closed over with vegetation, and in such places there was always a fearful accumulation of mud. To the naked Papuan this is no obstruction. He wades through it, and the next watercourse makes him clean again; but to myself, wearing boots and trousers, it was a most disagreeable thing to have to go up to my knees in a mud-hole every morning. The man I brought with me to cut wood fell ill soon after we arrived, or I would have set him to clear fresh paths in the worst places. For the first ten days it generally rained every afternoon and all night r but by going out every hour of fine weather, I managed to get on tolerably with my collections of birds and insects, finding most of those collected by Lesson during his visit in the Coquille, as well as many new ones. It appears, however, that Dorey is not the place for Birds of Paradise, none of the natives being accustomed to preserve them. Those sold here are all brought from Amberbaki, about a hundred miles west, where the Doreyans go to trade.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The islands in the bay, with the low lands near the coast, seem to have been formed by recently raised coral reef\\'s, and are much strewn with masses of coral but little altered. The ridge behind my house, which runs out to the point, is also entirely coral rock, although there are signs of a stratified foundation in the ravines, and the rock itself is more compact and crystalline. It is therefore, probably older, a more recent elevation having exposed the low grounds and islands. On the other side of the bay rise the great mass of the Arfak mountains, said by the French navigators to be about ten thousand feet high, and inhabited by savage tribes. These are held in great dread by the Dorey people, who have often been attacked and plundered by them, and have some of their skulls hanging outside their houses. If I was seem going into the forest anywhere in the direction of the mountains, the little boys of the village would shout after me, \"Arfaki! Arfaki?\" just as they did after Lesson nearly forty years before.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 15th of May the Dutch war-steamer Etna arrived; but, as the coals had gone, it was obliged to stay till they came back. The captain knew when the coalship was to arrive, and how long it was chartered to stay at Dorey, and could have been back in time, but supposed it would wait for him, and so did not hurry himself. The steamer lay at anchor just opposite my house, and I had the advantage of hearing the half-hourly bells struck, which was very pleasant after the monotonous silence of the forest. The captain, doctor, engineer, and some other of the officers paid me visits; the servants came to the brook to wash clothes, and the son of the Prince of Tidore, with one or two companions, to bathe; otherwise I saw little of them, and was not disturbed by visitors so much as I had expected to be. About this time the weather set in pretty fine, but neither birds nor insects became much more abundant, and new birds -were very scarce. None of the Birds of Paradise except the common one were ever met with, and we were still searching in vain for several of the fine birds which Lesson had obtained here. Insects were tolerably abundant, but were not on the average so fine as those of Amboyna, and I reluctantly came to the conclusion that Dorey was not a good collecting locality. Butterflies were very scarce, arid were mostly the same as those which I had obtained at Aru.\\nHORNED FLIES\\nElaphomia cervicornis - - - - - - Elaphomia wallecia\\nE. brevicornis \\xa0- - - - - - - - - - E. alcicornis\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Among the insects of other orders, the most curious and novel were a group of horned flies, of which I obtained four distinct species, settling on fallen trees and decaying trunks. These remarkable insects, which have been described by Mr. W. W. Saunders as a new genus, under the name of Elaphomia or deer- flies, are about half an inch long, slender-bodied, and with very long legs, which they draw together so as to elevate their bodies high above the surface they are standing upon. The front pair of legs are much shorter, and these are often stretched directly forwards, so as to resemble antenna. The horns spring from beneath the eye, and seem to be a prolongation of the lower part of the orbit. In the largest and most singular species, named Elaphomia cervicornis or the stag-horned deer-fly, these horns are nearly as long as the body, having two branches, with two small snags near their bifurcation, so as to resemble the horns of a stag. They are black, with the tips pale, while the body and legs are yellowish brown, and the eyes (when alive) violet and green. The next species (Elaphomia wallacei) is of a dark brown colour, banded and spotted with yellow. The horns are about one- third the length of the insect, broad, flat, and of an elongated triangular foam. They are of a beautiful pink colour, edged with black, and with a pale central stripe. The front part of the head is also pink, and the eyes violet pink, with a green stripe across them, giving the insect a very elegant and singular appearance. The third species (Elaphomia alcicornis, the elk- horned deer-fly) is a little smaller than the two already described, but resembling in colour Elaphomia wallacei. The horns are very remarkable, being suddenly dilated into a flat plate, strongly toothed round the outer margin, and strikingly resembling the horns of the elk, after which it has been named. They are of a yellowish colour, margined with brown, and tipped with black on the three upper teeth. The fourth species (Elaphomia brevicornis, the short-horned deer-fly) differs considerably from the rest. It is stouter in form, of a nearly black colour, with a yellow ring at the base of the abdomen; the wings have dusky stripes, and the head is compressed and dilated laterally, with very small flat horns; which are black with a pale centre, and look exactly like the rudiment of the horns of the two preceding species. None of the females have any trace of the horns, ane Mr. Saunders places in the same genus a species which has no horns in either sex (Elaphomia polita). It is of a shining black colour, and resembles Elaphomia cervicornis in form, size, and general appearance. The figures above given represent these insects of their natural size and in characteristic attitudes.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The natives seldom brought me anything. They are poor creatures, and, rarely shoot a bird, pig, or kangaroo, or even the sluggish opossum-like Cuscus. The tree-kangaroos are found here, but must be very scarce, as my hunters, although out daily in the forest, never once saw them. Cockatoos, lories, and parroquets were really the only common birds. Even pigeons were scarce, and in little variety, although we occasionally got the fine crown pigeon, which was always welcome as an addition to our scantily furnished larder.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Just before the steamer arrived I had wounded my ankle by clambering among the trunks and branches of fallen trees (which formed my best hunting grounds for insects), and, as usual with foot wounds in this climate, it turned into an obstinate ulcer, keeping me in the house for several days. When it healed up it was followed by an internal inflammation of the foot, which by the doctor\\'s advice I poulticed incessantly for four or five days, bringing out a severe inflamed swelling on the tendon above the heel. This had to be leeched, and lanced, and doctored with ointments and poultices for several weeks, till I was almost driven to despair,--for the weather was at length fine, and I was tantalized by seeing grand butterflies flying past my door, and thinking of the twenty or thirty new species of insects that I ought to be getting every day. And this, too, in New Guinea--a country which I might never visit again,--a country which no naturalist had ever resided in before,--a country which contained more strange and new and beautiful natural objects than any other part of the globe. The naturalist will be able to appreciate my feelings, sitting from morning to night in my little hut, unable to move without a crutch, and my only solace the birds my hunters brought in every afternoon, and the few insects caught by my Ternate man, Lahagi, who now went out daily in my place, but who of course did not get a fourth part of what I should have obtained. To add to my troubles all my men were more or less ill, some with fever, others with dysentery or ague; at one time there were three of them besides myself all helpless, the coon alone being well, and having enough to do to wait upon us. The Prince of Tidore and the Resident of Panda were both on board the steamer, and were seeking Birds of Paradise, sending men round in every direction, so that there was no chance of my getting even native skins of the rarer kinds; and any birds, insects, or animals the Dorey people had to sell were taken on board the steamer, where purchasers were found for everything, and where a larger variety of articles were offered in exchange than I had to show.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After a month\\'s close confinement in the house I was at length able to go out a little, and about the same time I succeeded in getting a boat and six natives to take Ali and Lahagi to Amberbaki, and to bring them back at the end of a month. Ali was charged to buy all the Birds of Paradise he could get, and to shoot and skin all other rare or new birds; and Lahagi was to collect insects, which I hoped might be more abundant than at Dorey. When I recommenced my daily walks in search of insects, I found a great change in the neighbourhood, and one very agreeable to me. All the time I had been laid up the ship\\'s crew and the Javanese soldiers who had been brought in a tender (a sailing ship which had arrived soon after the Etna), had been employed cutting down, sawing, and splitting large trees for firewood, to enable the steamer to get back to Amboyna if the coal-ship did not return; and they had also cleared a number of wide, straight paths through the forest in various directions, greatly to the astonishment of the natives, who could not make out what it all meant. I had now a variety of walks, and a good deal of dead wood on which to search for insects; but notwithstanding these advantages, they were not nearly so plentiful as I had found them at Sarawak, or Amboyna, or Batchian, confirming my opinion that Dorey was not a good locality. It is quite probable, however, that at a station a few miles in the interior, away from the recently elevated coralline rocks and the influence of the sea air, a much more abundant harvest might be obtained.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0One afternoon I went on board the steamer to return the captain\\'s visit, and was shown some very nice sketches (by one of the lieutenants), made on the south coast, and also at the Arfak mountain, to which they had made an excursion. From these and the captain\\'s description, it appeared that the people of Arfak were similar to those of Dorey, and I could hear nothing of the straight-haired race which Lesson says inhabits the interior, but which no one has ever seen, and the account of which I suspect has originated in some mistake. The captain told me he had made a detailed survey of part of the south coast, and if the coal arrived should go away at once to Humboldt Pay, in longitude 141° east, which is the line up to which the Dutch claim New Guinea. On board the tender I found a brother naturalist, a German named Rosenberg, who was draughtsman to the surveying staff. He had brought two men with him to shoot and skin birds, and had been able to purchase a few rare skins from the natives. Among these was a pair of the superb Paradise Pie (Astrapia nigra) in tolerable preservation. They were brought from the island of Jobie, which may be its native country, as it certainly is of the rarer species of crown pigeon (Goura steursii), one of which was brought alive and sold on board. Jobie, however, is a very dangerous place, and sailors are often murdered there when on shore; sometimes the vessels themselves being attacked. Wandammen, on the mainland opposite Jobie, inhere there are said to be plenty of birds, is even worse, and at either of these places my life would not have been worth a week\\'s purchase had I ventured to live alone and unprotected as at Dorey. On board the steamer they had a pair of tree kangaroos alive. They differ chiefly from the ground-kangaroo in having a more hairy tail, not thickened at the base, and not used as a prop; and by the powerful claws on the fore-feet, by which they grasp the bark and branches, and seize the leaves on which they feed. They move along by short jumps on their hind-feet, which do not seem particularly well adapted for climbing trees. It has been supposed that these tree-kangaroos are a special adaptation to the swampy, half-drowned forests of, New Guinea, in place of the usual form of the group, which is adapted only to dry ground. Mr. Windsor Earl makes much of this theory, but, unfortunately for it, the tree-kangaroos are chiefly found in the northern peninsula of New Guinea, which is entirely composed of hills and mountains with very little flat land, while the kangaroo of the low flat Aru Islands (Dorcopsis asiaticus) is a ground species. A more probable supposition seems to lie, that the tree-kangaroo has been modified to enable it to feed on foliage in the vast forests of New Guinea, as these form the great natural feature which distinguishes that country from Australia.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On June 5th, the coal-ship arrived, having been sent back from Amboyna, with the addition of some fresh stores for the steamer. The wood, which had been almost all taken on board, was now unladen again, the coal taken in, and on the 17th both steamer and tender left for Humboldt Bay. We were then a little quiet again, and got something to eat; for while the vessels were here every bit of fish or vegetable was taken on board, and I had often to make a small parroquet serve for two meals. My men now returned from Amberbaki, but, alas brought me almost nothing. They had visited several villages, and even went two days\\' journey into the interior, but could find no skins of Birds of Paradise to purchase, except the common kind, and very few even of those. The birds found were the same as at Dorey, but were still scarcer. None of the natives anywhere near the coast shoot or prepare Birds of Paradise, which come from far in the interior over two or three ranges of mountains, passing by barter from village to village till they reach the sea. There the natives of Dorey buy them, and on their return home sell them .to the Bugis or Ternate traders. It is therefore hopeless for a traveller to go to any particular place on the coast of New Guinea where rare Paradise birds may have been bought, in hopes of obtaining freshly killed specimens from the natives; and it also shows the scarcity of these birds in any one locality, since from the Amberbaki district, a celebrated place, where at least five or six species have been procured, not one of the rarer ones has been obtained this year. The Prince of Tidore, who would certainly have got them if any were to be had, was obliged to put up with a few of the common yellow ones. I think it probable that a longer residence at Dorey, a little farther in the interior, might show that several of the rarer kinds were found there, as I obtained a single female of the fine scale-breasted Ptiloris magnificus. I was told at Ternate of a bird that is certainly not yet known in Europe, a black King Paradise Bird, with the curled tail and beautiful side plumes of the common species, but all the rest of the plumage glossy black. The people of Dorey knew nothing about this, although they recognised by description most of the otter species.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When the steamer left, I was suffering from a severe attack of fever. In about a week I got over this, but it was followed by such a soreness of the whole inside of the mouth, tongue, and gums, that for many days I could put nothing solid between my lips, but was obliged to subsist entirely on slops, although in other respects very well. At the same time two of my men again fell ill, one with fever, the other with dysentery, and both got very bad. I did what I could for them with my small stock of medicines, but they lingered on for some weeks, till on June 26th poor Jumaat died. He was about eighteen years of age, a native, I believe, of Bouton, and a quiet lad, not very active, but doing his work pretty steadily, and as well as he was able. As my men were all Mahometans, I let them bury him in their own fashion, giving them some new cotton cloth for a shroud.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On July 6th the steamer returned from the eastward. The weather was still terribly wet, when, according to rule, it should have been fine and dry. We had scarcely anything to eat, and were all of us ill. Fevers, colds, and dysentery were continually attacking us, and made me long I-o get away from New Guinea, as much as ever I had longed to come there. The captain of the Etna paid me a visit, and gave me a very interesting account of his trip. They had stayed at Humboldt Bay several days, and found it a much more beautiful and more interesting place than Dorey, as well as a better harbour. The natives were quite unsophisticated, being rarely visited except by stray whalers, and they were superior to the Dorey people, morally and physically. They went quite naked. Their houses were some in the water and some inland, and were all neatly and well built; their fields were well cultivated, and the paths to them kept clear and open, in which respects Dorey is abominable. They were shy at first, and opposed the boats with hostile demonstrations, beading their bows, and intimating that they would shoot if an attempt was made to land. Very judiciously the captain gave way, but threw on shore a few presents, and after two or three trials they were permitted to land, and to go about and see the country, and were supplied with fruits and vegetables. All communication was carried on with them by signs--the Dorey interpreter, who accompanied the steamer, being unable to understand a word of their language. No new birds or animals were obtained, but in their ornaments the feathers of Paradise birds were seen, showing, as might be expected, that these birds range far in this direction, and probably all over New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is curious that a rudimental love of art should co-exist with such a very low state of civilization. The people of Dorey are great carvers and painters. The outsides of the houses, wherever there is a plank, are covered with rude yet characteristic figures. The high-peaked prows of their boats are ornamented with masses of open filagree work, cut out of solid blocks of wood, and often of very tasteful design, As a figurehead, or pinnacle, there is often a human figure, with a head of cassowary feathers to imitate the Papuan \"mop.\"\\nCARVED TOOL FOR MAKING POTTERY\\nThe floats of their fishing-lines, the wooden beaters used in tempering the clay for their pottery, their tobacco-boxes, and other household articles, are covered with carving of tasteful and often elegant design. Did we not already know that such taste and skill are compatible with utter barbarism, we could hardly believe that the same people are, in other matters, utterly wanting in all sense of order, comfort, or decency. Yet such is the case. They live in the most miserable, crazy, and filthy hovels, which are utterly destitute of anything that can be called furniture; not a stool, or bench, or board is seen in them, no brush seems to be known, and the clothes they wear are often filthy bark, or rags, or sacking. Along the paths where they daily pass to and from their provision grounds, not an overhanging bough or straggling briar ever seems to he cut, so that you have to brush through a rank vegetation, creep under fallen trees and spiny creepers, and wade through pools of mud and mire, which cannot dry up because the sun is not allowed to penetrate. Their food is almost wholly roots and vegetables, with fish or game only as an occasional luxury, and they are consequently very subject to various skin diseases, the children especially being often miserable-looking objects, blotched all over with eruptions and sores. If these people are not savages, where shall we find any? Yet they have all a decided love for the fine arts, and spend their leisure time in executing works whose good taste and elegance would often be admired in our schools of design!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0During the latter part of my stay in New Guinea the weather was very wet, my only shooter was ill, and birds became scarce, so that my only resource was insect-hunting. I worked very hard every hour of fine weather, and daily obtained a number of new species. Every dead tree and fallen log was searched and searched again; and among the dry and rotting leaves, which still hung on certain trees which had been cut down, I found an abundant harvest of minute Coleoptera. Although I never afterwards found so many large and handsome beetles as in Borneo, yet I obtained here a great variety of species. For the first two or three weeks, while I was searching out the best localities, I took about 30 different kinds of beetles n day, besides about half that number of butterflies, and a few of the other orders. But afterwards, up to the very last week, I averaged 49 species a day. On the 31st of May, I took 78 distinct sorts, a larger number than I had ever captured before, principally obtained among dead trees and under rotten bark. A good long walk on a fine day up the hill, and to the plantations of the natives, capturing everything not very common that came in my way, would produce about 60 species; but on the last day of June I brought home no less than 95 distinct kinds of beetles, a larger number than I ever obtained in one day before or since. It was a fine hot day, and I devoted it to a search among dead leaves, beating foliage, and hunting under rotten bark, in all the best stations I had discovered during my walks. I was out from ten in the morning till three in the afternoon, and it took me six hours\\' work at home to pin and set out all the specimens, and to separate the species. Although T had already been working this shot daily for two months and a half, and had obtained over 800 species of Coleoptera, this day\\'s work added 32 new ones. Among these were 4 Longicorns, 2 Caribidae, 7 Staphylinidae, 7 Curculionidae, 2 Copridae, 4 Chrysomelidae, 3 Heteromera, 1 Elates, and 1 Buprestis. Even on the last day I went out, I obtained 10 new species; so that although I collected over a thousand distinct sorts of beetles in a space not much exceeding a square mile during the three months of my residence at Dorey, I cannot believe that this represents one half the species really inhabiting the same spot, or a fourth of what might be obtained in an area extending twenty miles in each direction.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 22cd of July the schooner Hester Helena arrived, and five days afterwards we bade adieu to Dorey, without much regret, for in no place which I have visited have I encountered more privations and annoyances. Continual rain, continual sickness, little wholesome food, with a plague of ants and files, surpassing anything I had before met with, required all a naturalist\\'s ardour to encounter; and when they were uncompensated by great success in collecting, became all the more insupportable. This long thought-of and much-desired voyage to New Guinea had realized none of my expectations. Instead of being far better than the Aru Islands, it was in almost everything much worse. Instead of producing several of the rarer Paradise birds, I had not even seen one of them, and had not obtained any one superlatively fine bird or insect. I cannot deny, however, that Dorey was very rich in ants. One small black kind was excessively abundant. Almost every shrub and tree was more or less infested with it, and its large papery nests were everywhere to be seen. They immediately took possession of my house, building a large nest in the roof, and forming papery tunnels down almost every post. They swarmed on my table as I was at work setting out my insects, carrying them off from under my very nose, and even tearing them from the cards on which they were gummed if I left them for an instant. They crawled continually over my hands and face, got into my hair, and roamed at will over my whole body, not producing much inconvenience till they began to bite, which they would do on meeting with any obstruction to their passage, and with a sharpness which made me jump again and rush to undress and turn out the offender. They visited my bed also, so that night brought no relief from their persecutions; and I verily believe that during my three and a half months\\' residence at Dorey I was never for a single hour entirely free from them. They were not nearly so voracious as many other kinds, but their numbers and ubiquity rendered it necessary to be constantly on guard against them.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The flies that troubled me most were a large kind of blue-bottle or blow-fly. These settled in swarms on my bird skins when first put out to dry, filling their plumage with masses of eggs, which, if neglected, the next day produced maggots. They would get under the wings or under the body where it rested on the drying-board, sometimes actually raising it up half an inch by the mass of eggs deposited in a few hours; and every egg was so firmly glued to the fibres of the feathers, as to make it a work of much time and patience to get them off without injuring the bird. In no other locality have I ever been troubled with such a plague as this.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 29th we left Dorey, and expected a quick voyage home, as it was the time of year when we ought to have had steady southerly and easterly winds. Instead of these, however, we had calms and westerly breezes, and it was seventeen days before we reached Ternate, a distance of five hundred miles only, which, with average winds, could have been done in five days. It was a great treat to me to find myself back again in my comfortable house, enjoying milk to my tea and coffee, fresh bread and butter, and fowl and fish daily for dinner. This New Guinea voyage had used us all up, and I determined to stay and recruit before I commenced any fresh expeditions. My succeeding journeys to Gilolo and Batchian have already been narrated, and if; now only remains for me to give an account of my residence in Waigiou, the last Papuan territory I visited in search of Birds of Paradise.\\nVOYAGE FROM CERAM TO WAIGIOU\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(JUNE AND JULY 1860)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0IN my twenty-fifth chapter I have described my arrival at Wahai, on my way to Mysol and Waigiou, islands which belong to the Papuan district, and the account of which naturally follows after that of my visit to the mainland of New Guinea. I now take up my narrative at my departure from Wahai, with the intention of carrying various necessary stores to my assistant, Mr. Allen, at Silinta, in Mysol, and then continuing my journey to Waigiou. It will be remembered that I was travelling in a small prau, which I had purchased and fitted up in Goram, and that, having been deserted by my crew on the coast of Ceram, I had obtained four men at Wahai, who, with my Amboynese hunter, constituted my crew.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Between Ceram and Mysol there are sixty miles of open sea, and along this wide channel the east monsoon blows strongly; so that with native praus, which will not lay up to the wind, it requires some care in crossing. In order to give ourselves sufficient leeway, we sailed back from Wahai eastward, along the coast of Ceram, with the land-breeze; but in the morning (June 18th) had not gone nearly so far as I expected. My pilot, an old and experienced sailor, named Gurulampoko, assured me there was a current setting to the eastward, and that we could easily lay across to Silinta, in Mysol. As we got out from the land the wind increased, and there was a considerable sea, which made my short little vessel plunge and roll about violently. By sunset -we had not got halfway across, but could see Mysol distinctly. All night we went along uneasily, and at daybreak, on looking out anxiously, I found that we had fallen much to the westward during the night, owing, no doubt, to the pilot being sleepy and not keeping the boat sufficiently close to the wind. We could see the mountains distinctly, but it was clear we should not reach Silinta, and should have some difficulty in getting to the extreme westward point of the island. The sea was now very boisterous, and our prau was continually beaten to leeward by the waves, and after another weary day we found w e could not get to Mysol at all, but might perhaps reach the island called Pulo Kanary, about ten miles to the north-west. Thence we might await a favourable wind to reach Waigamma, on the north side of the island, and visit Allen by means of a small boat.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0About nine o\\'clock at night, greatly to my satisfaction, we got under the lea of this island, into quite smooth water--for I had been very sick and uncomfortable, and had eaten scarcely anything since the preceding morning. We were slowly nearing the shore, which the smooth dark water told us we could safely approach; and were congratulating ourselves on soon being at anchor, with the prospect of hot coffee, a good supper, and a sound sleep, when the wind completely dropped, and we had to get out the oars to row. We were not more than two hundred yards from the shore, when I noticed that we seemed to get no nearer although the men were rowing hard, but drifted to the westward, and the prau would not obey the helm, but continually fell off, and gave us much trouble to bring her up again. Soon a laud ripple of water told us we were seized by one of those treacherous currents which so frequently frustrate all the efforts of the voyager in these seas; the men threw down the oars in despair, and in a few minutes we drifted to leeward of the island fairly out to sea again, and lost our last chance of ever reaching Mysol! Hoisting our jib, we lay to, and in the morning found ourselves only a few miles from the island, but wit, such a steady wind blowing from its direction as to render it impossible for us to get back to it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now made sail to the northward, hoping soon to get a more southerly wind. Towards noon the sea was much smoother, and with a S.S.E. wind we were laying in the direction of Salwatty, which I hoped to reach, as I could there easily get a boat to take provisions and stores to my companion in Mysol. This wind did not, however, last long, but died away into a calm; and a light west wind springing up, with a dark bank of clouds, again gave us hopes of reaching Mysol. We were soon, however, again disappointed. The E.S.E. wind began to blow again with violence, and continued all night in irregular gusts, and with a short cross sea tossed us about unmercifully, and so continually took our sails aback, that we were at length forced to run before it with our jib only, to escape being swamped by our heavy mainsail. After another miserable and anxious night, we found that we had drifted westward of the island of Poppa, and the wind being again a little southerly, we made all sail in order to reach it. This we did not succeed in doing, passing to the north-west, when the wind again blew hard from the E.S.E., and our last hope of finding a refuge till better weather was frustrated. This was a very serious matter to me, as I could not tell how Charles Allen might act, if, after waiting in vain for me, he should return to Wahai, and find that I had left there long before, and had not since been heard of. Such an event as our missing an island forty miles long would hardly occur to him, and he would conclude either that our boat had foundered, or that my crew had murdered me and run away with her. However, as it was physically impossible now for me to reach him, the only thing to be done was to make the best of my way to Waigiou, and trust to our meeting some traders, who might convey to him the news of my safety.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Finding on my map a group of three small islands, twenty-five miles north of Poppa, I resolved, if possible, to rest there a day or two. We could lay our boat\\'s head N.E. by N.; but a heavy sea from the eastward so continually beat us off our course, and we made so much leeway, that I found it would be as much as we could do to reach them. It was a delicate point to keep our head in the best direction, neither so close to the wind as to stop our way, or so free as to carry us too far to leeward. I continually directed the steersman myself, and by incessant vigilance succeeded, just at sunset, in bringing our boat to an anchor under the lee of the southern point of one of the islands. The anchorage was, however, by no means good, there being a fringing coral reef, dry at low water, beyond which, on a bottom strewn with masses of coral, we were obliged to anchor. We had now been incessantly tossing about for four days in our small undecked boat, with constant disappointments and anxiety, and it was a great comfort to have a night of quiet and comparative safety. My old pilot had never left the helm for more than an hour at a time, when one of the others would relieve him for a little sleep; so I determined the next morning to look out for a secure and convenient harbour, and rest on shore for a day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the morning, finding it would be necessary for us to get round a rocky point, I wanted my men to go on shore and cut jungle- rope, by which to secure us from being again drafted away, as the wind was directly off shore. I unfortunately, however, allowed myself to be overruled by the pilot and crew, who all declared that it was the easiest thing possible, and that they would row the boat round the point in a few minutes. They accordingly got up the anchor, set the jib, and began rowing; but, just as I had feared, we drifted rapidly off shore, and had to drop anchor again in deeper water, and much farther off. The two best men, a Papuan and a Malay now swam on shore, each carrying a hatchet, and went into the jungle to seek creepers for rope. After about an hour our anchor loosed hold, and began to drag. This alarmed me greatly, and we let go our spare anchor, and, by running out all our cable, appeared tolerably secure again. We were now most anxious for the return of the men, and were going to fire our muskets to recall them, when we observed them on the beach, some way off, and almost immediately our anchors again slipped, and we drifted slowly away into deep water. We instantly seized the oars, but found we could not counteract the wind and current, and our frantic cries to the men were not heard till we had got a long way off; as they seemed to be hunting for shell-fish on the beach. Very soon, however, they stared at us, and in a few minutes seemed to comprehend their situation; for they rushed down into the water, as if to swim off, but again returned on shore, as if afraid to make the attempt. We had drawn up our anchors at first not to check our rowing; but now, finding we could do nothing, we let them both hang down by the full length of the cables. This stopped our way very much, and we drifted from shore very slowly, and hoped the men would hastily form a raft, or cut down a soft-wood tree, and paddle out, to us, as we were still not more than a third of a mile from shore. They seemed, however, to have half lost their senses, gesticulating wildly to us, running along the beach, then going unto the forest; and just when we thought they had prepared some mode of making an attempt to reach us, we saw the smoke of a fire they had made to cook their shell-fish! They had evidently given up all idea of coming after us, and we were obliged to look to our own position.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We were now about a mile from shore, and midway between two of the islands, but we were slowly drifting out, to sea to the westward, and our only chance of yet saving the men was to reach the opposite shore. We therefore sot our jib and rowed hard; but the wind failed, and we drifted out so rapidly that we had some difficulty in reaching the extreme westerly point of the island. Our only sailor left, then swam ashore with a rope, and helped to tow us round the point into a tolerably safe and secure anchorage, well sheltered from the wind, but exposed to a little swell which jerked our anchor and made us rather uneasy. We were now in a sad plight, having lost our two best men, and being doubtful if we had strength left to hoist our mainsail. We had only two days\\' water on board, and the small, rocky, volcanic island did not promise us much chance of finding any. The conduct of the men on shore was such as to render it doubtful if they would make any serious attempt to reach us, though they might easily do so, having two good choppers, with which in a day they could male a small outrigger raft on which they could safely cross the two miles of smooth sea with the wind right aft, if they started from the east end of the island, so as to allow for the current. I could only hope they would be sensible enough to make the attempt, and determined to stay as long as I could to give them the chance.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We passed an anxious night, fearful of again breaking our anchor or rattan cable. In the morning (23rd), finding all secure, I waded on shore with my two men, leaving the old steersman and the cook on board, with a loaded musketto recall us if needed. We first walked along the beach, till stopped by the vertical cliffs at the east end of the island, finding a place where meat had been smoked, a turtle-shell still greasy, and some cut wood, the leaves of which were still green, showing that some boat had been here very recently. We then entered the jungle, cutting our way up to the top of the hill, but when we got there could see nothing, owing to the thickness of the forest. Returning, we cut some bamboos, and sharpened them to dig for water in a low spot where some sago -trees were growing; when, just as we were going to begin, Hoi, the Wahai man, called out to say he had found water. It was a deep hole among the Sago trees, in stiff black clay, full of water, which was fresh, but smelt horribly from the quantity of dead leaves and sago refuse that had fallen in. Hastily concluding that it was a spring, or that the water had filtered in, we baled it all out as well as a dozen or twenty buckets of mud and rubbish, hoping by night to have a good supply of clean water. I then went on board to breakfast, leaving my two men to make a bamboo raft to carry us on shore and back without wading. I had scarcely finished when our cable broke, and we bumped against the rocks. Luckily it was smooth and calm, and no damage was done. We searched for and got up our anchor, and found teat the cable had been cut by grating all night upon the coral. Had it given way in the night, we might have drifted out to sea without our anchor, or been seriously damaged. In the evening we went to fetch water from the well, when, greatly to our dismay, we found nothing but a little liquid mud at the bottom, and it then became evident that the hole was one which had been made to collect rain water, and would never fill again as long as the present drought continued. As we did not know what we might suffer for want of water, we filled our jar with this muddy stuff so that it might settle. In the afternoon I crossed over to the other side of the island, and made a large fire, in order that our men might see we were still there.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next day (24th) I determined to have another search for water; and when the tide was out rounded a rocky point and went to the extremity of the island without finding any sign of the smallest stream. On our way back, noticing a very small dry bed of a watercourse, I went up it to explore, although everything was so dry that my men loudly declared it was useless to expect water there; but a little way up I was rewarded by finding a few pints in a small pool. We searched higher up in every hole and channel where water marks appeared, but could find not a drop more. Sending one of my men for a large jar and teacup, we searched along the beach till we found signs of another dry watercourse, and on ascending this were so fortunate as to discover two deep sheltered rock-holes containing several gallons of water, enough to fill all our jars. When the cup came we enjoyed a good drink of the cool pure water, and before we left had carried away, I believe, every drop on the island.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the evening a good-sized prau appeared in sight, making apparently for the island where our men were left, and we had some hopes they might be seen and picked up, but it passed along mid-channel, and did not notice the signals we tried to make. I was now, however, pretty easy as to the fate of the men. There was plenty of sago on our rocky island, and there world probably be some on the fiat one they were left on. They had choppers, and could cut down a tree and make sago, and would most likely find sufficient water by digging. Shell-fish were abundant, and they would be able to manage very well till some boat should touch there, or till I could send and fetch them. The next day we devoted to cutting wood, filling up our jars with all the water we could find, and making ready to sail in the evening. I shot a small lory closely resembling a common species at Ternate, and a glossy starling which differed from the allied birds of Ceram and Matabello. Large wood-pigeons and crows were the only other birds I saw, but I did not obtain specimens.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0About eight in the evening of June 25th we started, and found that with all hands at work we could just haul up our mainsail. We had a fair wind during the night and sailed north-east, finding ourselves in the morning about twenty miles west of the extremity of Waigiou with a number of islands intervening. About ten o\\'clock we ran full on to a coral reef, which alarmed us a good deal, but luckily got safe off again. About two in the afternoon we reached an extensive coral reef, and were sailing close alongside of it, when the wind suddenly dropped, and we drifted on to it before we could get in our heavy mainsail, which we were obliged to let run down and fall partly overboard. We had much difficulty in getting off, but at last got into deep water again, though with reefs and islands all around us. At night we did not know what to do, as no one on board could tell where we were or what dangers might surround us, the only one of our crew who was acquainted with the coast of Waigiou having been. left on the island. We therefore took in all sail and allowed ourselves to drift, as we were some miles from the nearest land. A light breeze, however, sprang up, and about midnight we found ourselves again bumping over a coral reef. As it was very dark, and we knew nothing of our position, we could only guess how to get off again, and had there been a little more wind we might have been knocked to pieces. However, in about half an hour we did get off, and then thought it best to anchor on the edge of the reef till morning. Soon after daylight on the 7th, finding our prau had received no damage, we sailed on with uncertain winds and squalls, threading our way among islands and reefs, and guided only by a small map, which was very incorrect and quite useless, and by a general notion of the direction we ought to take. In the afternoon we found a tolerable anchorage under a small island and stayed for the night, and I shot a large fruit-pigeon new to me, which I have since named Carpophaga tumida. I also saw and shot at the rare white-headed kingfisher (Halcyon saurophaga), but did not kill it. The next morning we sailed on, and having a fair wind reached the shores of the large island of Waigiou. On rounding a point we again ran full on to a coral reef with our mainsail up, but luckily the wind had almost died away, and with a good deal of exertion we managed get safely off.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now had to search for the narrow channel among islands, which we knew was somewhere hereabouts, and which leads to the villages on the south side ofWaigiou. Entering a deep bay which looked promising, we got to the end of it, but it was then dusk, so we anchored for the night, and having just finished all our water could cook no rice for supper. Next morning early (29th) we went on shore among the mangroves, and a little way inland found some water, which relieved our anxiety considerably, and left us free to go along the coast in search of the opening, or of some one who could direct us to it. During the three days we had now been among the reefs and islands, we had only seen a single small canoe, which had approached pretty near to us, and then, notwithstanding our signals, went off in another direction. The shores seemed all desert; not a house, or boat, or human being, or a puff of smoke was to be seen; and as we could only go on the course that the ever-changing wind would allow us (our hands being too few to row any distance), our prospects of getting to our destination seemed rather remote and precarious. Having gone to the eastward extremity of the deep bay we had entered, without finding any sign of an opening, we turned westward; and towards evening were so fortunate as to find a small village of seven miserable houses built on piles in the water. Luckily the Orang- kaya, or head man, could speak a little. Malay, and informed us that the entrance to the strait was really in the bay we had examined, but that it was not to be seen except when- close inshore. He said the strait was often very narrow, and wound among lakes and rocks and islands, and that it would take two days to reach the large village of Muka, and three more to get to Waigiou. I succeeded in hiring two men to go with us to Muka, bringing a small boat in which to return; but we had to wait a day for our guides, so I took my gun and made a little excursion info the forest. The day was wet and drizzly, and I only succeeded in shooting two small birds, but I saw the great black cockatoo, and had a glimpse of one or two Birds of Paradise, whose loud screams we had heard on first approaching the coast. Leaving the village the next morning (July 1st) with a light wind, it took us all day to reach the entrance to the channel, which resembled a small river, and was concealed by a projecting point, so that it was no wonder we did not discover it amid the dense forest vegetation which everywhere covers these islands to the water\\'s edge. A little way inside it becomes bounded by precipitous rocks, after winding among which for about two miles, we emerged into what seemed a lake, but which was in fact a deep gulf having a narrow entrance on the south coast. This gulf was studded along its shores with numbers of rocky islets, mostly mushroom shaped, from the `eater having worn away the lower part of the soluble coralline limestone, leaving them overhanging from ten to twenty feet. Every islet was covered will strange-looping shrubs and trees, and was generally crowned by lofty and elegant palms, which also studded the ridges of the mountainous shores, forming one of the most singular and picturesque landscapes I have ever seen. The current which had brought us through the narrow strait now ceased, and we were obliged to row, which with our short and heavy prau was slow work. I went on shore several times, but the rocks were so precipitous, sharp, and honeycombed, that Ifound it impossible to get through the tangled thicket with which they were everywhere clothed. It took us three days to get to the entrance of the gulf, and then the wind was such as to prevent our going any further, and we might have had to wait for days or weeps, when, much to my surprise and gratification, a boat arrived from Muka with one of the head men, who had in some mysterious manner heard I was on my way, and had come to my assistance, bringing a present of cocoa-nuts and vegetables. Being thoroughly acquainted with the coast, and having several extra men to assist us, he managed to get the prau along by rowing, poling, or sailing, and by night had brought us safely into harbour, a great relief after our tedious and unhappy voyage. We had been already eight days among the reefs and islands of Waigiou, coming a distance of about fifty miles, and it was just forty days since we had sailed from Goram.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Immediately on our arrival at Muka, I engaged a small boat and three natives to go in search of my lost men, and sent one of my own men with them to make sure of their going to the right island. In ten days they returned, but to my great regret and disappointment, without the men. The weather had been very bad, and though they had reached an island within sight of that in which the men were, they could get no further. They had waited there six days for better weather, and then, having no more provisions, and the man I had sent with them being very ill and not expected to live, they returned. As they now knew the island, I was determined they should make another trial, and (by a liberal payment of knives, handkerchiefs, and tobacco, with plenty of provisions) persuaded them to start back immediately, and make another attempt. They did not return again till the 29th of July, having stayed a few days at their own village of Bessir on the way; but this time they had succeeded and brought with them my two lost men, in tolerable health, though thin and weak. They had lived exactly a month on the island had found water, and had subsisted on the roots and tender flower-stalks of a species of Bromelia, on shell-fish. and on a few turtles\\' eggs. Having swum to the island, they had only a pair of trousers and a shirt between them, but had made a hut of palm-leaves, and had altogether got on very well. They saw that I waited for them three days at the opposite island, but had been afraid to cross, lest the current should have carried them out to sea, when they would have been inevitably lost. They had felt sure I would send for them on the first opportunity, and appeared more grateful than natives usually are for my having done so; while I felt much relieved that my voyage, though sufficiently unfortunate, had not involved loss of life.\\nWAIGIOU\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(JULY TO SEPTEMER 1860)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0THE village of Muka, on the south coast of Waigiou, consists of a number of poor huts, partly in the water and partly on shore, and scattered irregularly over a space of about half a mile in a shallow bay. Around it are a few cultivated patches, and a good deal of second-growth woody vegetation; while behind, at the distance of about half a mile, rises the virgin forest, through which are a few paths to some houses and plantations a mile or two inland. The country round is rather flat, and in places swampy, and there are one or two small streams which run behind the village into the sea below it. Finding that no house could be had suitable to my purpose, and hawing so often experienced the advantages of living close to or just within the forest, I obtained the assistance of half-a-dozen men; and having selected a spot near the path and the stream, and close to a fine fig- tree, which stood just within the forest, we cleared the ground and set to building a house. As I did not expect to stay here so long as I had done at Dorey, I built a long, low, narrow shed, about seven feet high on one side and four on the other, which required but little wood, and was put up very rapidly. Our sails, with a few old attaps from a deserted but in the village, formed the walls, and a quantity of \"cadjans,\" or palm-leaf mats, covered in the roof. On the third day my house was finished, and all my things put in and comfortably arranged to begin work, and I was quite pleased at having got established so quickly and in such a nice situation.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It had been so far fine weather, but in the night it rained hard, and we found our mat roof would not keep out water. It first began to drop, and then to stream over everything. I had to get up in the middle of the night to secure my insect-boxes, rice, and other perishable articles, and to find a dry place to sleep in, for my bed was soaked. Fresh leaks kept forming as the rain continued, and w e all passed a very miserable and sleepless night. In the morning the sun shone brightly, and everything was put out to dry. We tried to find out why the mats leaked, and thought we had discovered that they had been laid on upside down. Having shifted there all, and got everything dry and comfortable by the evening, we again went to bed, and before midnight were again awaked by torrent of rain and leaks streaming in upon us as bad as ever. There was no more sleep for us that night, and the next day our roof was again taken to pieces, and we came to the conclusion that the fault was a want of slope enough in the roof for mats, although it would be sufficient for the usual attap thatch. I therefore purchased a few new and some old attaps, and in the parts these would not cover we put the mats double, and then at last had the satisfaction of finding our roof tolerably water-tight.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I was now able to begin working at the natural history of the island. When I first arrived I was surprised at being told that there were no Paradise Birds at Muka, although there were plenty at Bessir, a place where the natives caught them and prepared the skins. I assured the people I had heard the cry of these birds close to the village, but they world not believe that I could know their cry. However, the very first time I went into the forest I not only heard but saw them, and was convinced there were plenty about; but they were very shy, and it was some time before we got any. My hunter first shot a female, and I one day got very close to a fine male. He was, as I expected, the rare red species, Paradisea rubra, which alone inhabits this island, and is found nowhere else. He was quite low down, running along a bough searching for insects, almost like a woodpecker, and the long black riband-like filaments in his tail hung down in the most graceful double curve imaginable. I covered him with my gun, and was going to use the barrel which had a very small charge of powder and number eight shot, so as not to injure his plumage, but the gun missed fire, and he was off in an instant among the thickest jungle. Another day we saw no less than eight fine males at different times, and fired four times at them; but though other birds at the same distance almost always dropped, these all got away, and I began to think we were not to get this magnificent species. At length the fruit ripened on the fig-tree close by my house, and many birds came to feed on it; and one morning, as I was taking my coffee, a male Paradise Bird was seen to settle on its top. I seized my gun, ran under the tree, and, gazing up, could see it flying across from branch to branch, seizing a fruit here and another there, and then, before I could get a sufficient aim to shoot at such a height (for it was one of the loftiest trees of the tropics), it was away into the forest. They now visited the tree every morning; but they stayed so short a time, their motions were so rapid, and it was so difficult to see them, owing to the lower trees, which impeded the view, that it was only after several days\\' watching, and one or two misses, that I brought down my bird--a male in the most magnificent plumage.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This bird differs very much from the two large species which I had already obtained, and, although it wants the grace imparted by their long golden trains, is in many respects more remarkable and more beautiful. The head, back, and shoulders are clothed with a richer yellow, the deep metallic green colour of the throat extends further over the head, and the feathers are elongated on the forehead into two little erectile crests. The side plumes are shorter, but are of a rich red colour, terminating in delicate white points, and the middle tail- feathers are represented by two long rigid glossy ribands, which are black, thin, and semi-cylindrical, and droop gracefully in a spiral curve. Several other interesting birds were obtained, and about half-a-dozen quite new ones; but none of any remarkable beauty, except the lovely little dove, Ptilonopus pulchellus, which with several other pigeons I shot on the same fig-tree close to my house. It is of a beautiful green colour above, with a forehead of the richest crimson, while beneath it is ashy white and rich yellow, banded with violet red.\\nTHE RED BIRD OF PARADISE (Paradisea rubra.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the evening of our arrival at Muka I observed what appeared like a display of Aurora Borealis, though I could hardly believe that this was possible at a point a little south of the equator. The night was clear and calm, and the northern sky presented a diffused light, with a constant succession of faint vertical flashings or flickerings, exactly similar to an ordinary aurora in England. The next day was fine, but after that the weather was unprecedentedly bad, considering that it ought to have been the dry monsoon. For near a month we had wet weather; the sun either not appearing at all, or only for an hour or two about noon. Morning and evening, as well as nearly all night, it rained or drizzled, and boisterous winds, with dark clouds, formed the daily programme. With the exception that it was never cold, it was just such weather as a very bad English November or February.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The people of Waigiou are not truly indigenes of the island, which possesses no \"Alfuros,\" or aboriginal inhabitants. [footnote: Dr. Guillemard met with some people who, he was told, were true indigenes.  But it would be difficult to determine the point without a tolerably complete knowledge of all the surrounding islands and their languages.] They appear to be a mixed race, partly from Gilolo, partly from New Guinea. Malays and Alfuros from the former island have probably settled here, and many of them have taken Papuan wives from Salwatty or Dorey, while the influx of people from those places, and of slaves, has led to the formation of a tribe exhibiting almost all the transitions from a nearly pure Malayan to an entirely Papuan type. The language spoken by them is entirely Papuan, being that which is used on all the coasts of Mysol, Salwatty, the north-west of New Guinea, and the islands in the great Geelvink Bay,--a fact which indicates the way in which the coast settlements have been formed. The fact that so many of the islands between New Guinea and the Moluccas--such as Waigiou, Guebe, Poppa, Obi, Batchian, as well as the south and east peninsulas of Gilolo--possess no aboriginal tribes, but are inhabited by people who are evidently mongrels and wanderers, is a remarkable corroborative proof of the distinctness of the Malayan and Papuan races, and the separation of the geographical areas they inhabit. If these two great races were direct modifications, the one of the other, we should expect to find in the intervening region some homogeneous indigenous race presenting intermediate characters. For example, between the whitest inhabitants of Europe and the black Klings of South India, there are in the intervening districts homogeneous races which form a gradual transition from one to the other; while in America, although there is a perfect transition from the Anglo- Saxon to the negro, and from the Spaniard to the Indian, there is no homogeneous race forming a natural transition from one to the other. In the Malay Archipelago we have an excellent example of two absolutely distinct races, which appear to have approached each other, and intermingled in an unoccupied territory at a very recent epoch in the history of man; and I feel satisfied that no unprejudiced person could study them on the spot without being convinced that this is the true solution of the problem, rather than the almost universally accepted view that they are but modifications of one and the same race.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The people of Muka live in that abject state of poverty that is almost always found where the sago-tree is abundant. Very few of them take the trouble to plant any vegetables or fruit, but live almost entirely on sago and fish, selling a little tripang or tortoiseshell to buy the scanty clothing they require. Almost all of them, however, possess one or more Papuan slaves, on whose labour they live in almost absolute idleness, just going out on little fishing or trading excursions, as an excitement in their monotonous existence. They are under the rule of the Sultan of Tidore, and every year have to pay a small tribute of Paradise birds, tortoiseshell, or sago. To obtain these, they go in the fine season on a trading voyage to the mainland of New Guinea, and getting a few goods on credit from some Ceram or Bugis trader, make hard bargains with the natives, and gain enough to pay their tribute, and leave a little profit for themselves.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Such a country is not a very pleasant one to live in, for as there are no superfluities, there is nothing to sell; and had it not been for a trader from Ceram who was residing there during my stay, who had a small vegetable garden, and whose men occasionally got a few spare fish, I should often have had nothing to eat. Fowls, fruit, and vegetables are luxuries very rarely to be purchased at Muka; and even cocoa-nuts, so indispensable for eastern cookery, are not to be obtained; for though there are some hundreds of trees in the village, all the fruit is eaten green, to supply the place of the vegetables the people are too lazy to cultivate. Without eggs, cocoa-nuts, or plantains, we had very short commons, and the boisterous weather being unpropitious for fishing, we had to live on what few eatable birds we could shoot, with an occasional cuscus, or eastern opossum, the only quadruped, except pigs, inhabiting the island.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I had only shot two male Paradiseas on my tree when they ceased visiting it, either owing to the fruit becoming scarce, or that they were wise enough to know there was danger. We continued to hear and see them in the forest, but after a month had not succeeded in shooting any more; and as my chief object in visiting Waigiou was to get these birds, I determined to go to Bessir, where there are a number of Papuans who catch and preserve them. I hired a small outrigger boat for this journey, and left one of my men to guard my house and goods. We had to wait several days for fine weather, and at length started early one morning, and arrived late at night, after a rough and disagreeable passage. The village of Bessir was built in the water at the point of a small island. The chief food of the people was evidently shell-fish, since great heaps of the shells had accumulated in the shallow water between the houses and the land, forming a regular \"kitchen-midden \"for the exploration of some future archeologist. We spent the night in the chief\\'s house, and the next morning went over to the mainland to look out for a place where I could reside. This part of Waigiou is really another island to the south of the narrow channel we had passed through in coming to Muka. It appears to consist almost entirely of raised coral, whereas the northern island contains hard crystalline rocks. The shores were a range of low limestone cliffs, worn out by the water, so that the upper part generally overhung. At distant intervals were little coves and openings, where small streams came down from the interior; and in one of these we landed, pulling our boat up on a patch of white sandy beach. Immediately above was a large newly-made plantation of yams and plantains, and a small hot, which the chief said we might have the use of, if it would do for me. It was quite a dwarf\\'s house, just eight feet square, raised on posts so that the floor was four and a half feet above the ground, and the highest part of the ridge only five feet above the flour. As I am six feet and an inch in my stockings, I looked at this with some dismay; but finding that the other houses were much further from water, were dreadfully dirty, and were crowded with people, I at once accepted the little one, and determined to make the best of it. At first I thought of taking out the floor, which would leave it high enough to walk in and out without stooping; but then there would not be room enough, so I left it just as it was, had it thoroughly cleaned out, and brought up my baggage.\\nMY HOUSE AT BESSIR, IN WAIGIOU\\nThe upper story I used for sleeping in, and for a store-room. In the lower part (which was quite open all round) I fixed up a small table, arranged my boxes, put up hanging-shelves, laid a mat on the ground with my wicker-chair upon it, hung up another mat on the windward side, and then found that, by bending double and carefully creeping in, I could sit on my chair with my head just clear of the ceiling. Here I lived pretty comfortably for six weeks, taking all my meals and doing all my work at my little table, to and from which I had to creep in a semi-horizontal position a dozen times a day; and, after a few severe knocks on the head by suddenly rising from my chair, learnt to accommodate myself to circumstances. We put up a little sloping cooking-but outside, and a bench on which my lads could skin their birds. At night I went up to my little loft, they spread their mats on the, floor below, and we none of us grumbled at our lodgings.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My first business was to send for the men who were accustomed to catch the Birds of Paradise. Several came, and I showed them my hatchets, beads, knives, and handkerchiefs; and explained to them, as well as I could by signs, the price I would give for fresh-killed specimens. It is the universal custom to pay for everything in advance; but only one man ventured on this occasion to take goods to the value of two birds. The rest were suspicious, and wanted to see the result of the first bargain with the strange white man, the only one who had ever come to their island. After three days, my man brought me the first bird- -a very fine specimen, and alive, but tied up in a small bag, and consequently its tail and wing feathers very much crushed and injured. I tried to explain to him, and to the others that came with him, that I wanted them as perfect as possible, and that they should either kill them, or keep them on a perch with a string to their leg. As they were now apparently satisfied that all was fair, and that I had no ulterior designs upon them, six others took away goods; some for one bird, some for more, and one for as many as six. They said they had to go a long way for them, and that they would come back as soon as they caught any. At intervals of a few days or a week, some of them would return, bringing me one or more birds; but though they did not bring any more in bags, there was not much improvement in their condition. As they caught them a long way off in the forest, they would scarcely ever come with one, but would tie it by the leg to a stick, and put it in their house till they caught another. The poor creature would make violent efforts to escape, would get among the ashes, or hang suspended by the leg till the limb was swollen and half-putrefied, and sometimes die of starvation and worry. One had its beautiful head all defiled by pitch from a dammar torch; another had been so long dead that its stomach was turning green. Luckily, however, the skin and plumage of these birds is so firm and strong, that they bear washing and cleaning better than almost any other sort; and I was generally able to clean them so well that they did not perceptibly differ from those I had shot myself.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some few were brought me the same day they were caught, and I had an opportunity of examining them in all their beauty and vivacity. As soon as I found they were generally brought alive, I set one of my men to make a large bamboo cage with troughs for food and water, hoping to be able to keep some of them. I got the natives to bring me branches of a fruit they were very fond of, and I was pleased to find they ate it greedily, and would also take any number of live grasshoppers I gave them, stripping off the legs and wings, and then swallowing them. They drank plenty of water, and were in constant motion, jumping about the cage from perch to perch, clinging on the top and sides, and rarely resting a moment the first day till nightfall. The second day they were always less active, although they would eat as freely as before; and on the morning of the third day they were almost always found dead at the bottom of the cage, without any apparent cause. Some of them ate boiled rice as well as fruit and insects; but after trying many in succession, not one out of ten lived more than three days. The second or third day they would be dull, and in several cases they were seized with convulsions, and fell off the perch, dying a few hours afterwards. I tried immature as well as full-plumaged birds, but with no better success, and at length gave it up as a hopeless task, and confined my attention to preserving specimens in as good a condition as possible.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Red Birds of Paradise are not shot with blunt arrows, as in the Aru Islands and some parts of New Guinea, but are snared in a very ingenious manner. A large climbing Arum bears a red reticulated fruit, of which the birds are very fond. The hunters fasten this fruit on a stout forked stick, and provide themselves with a fine but strong cord. They then seep out some tree in the forest on which these birds are accustomed to perch, and climbing up it fasten the stick to a branch and arrange the cord in a noose so ingeniously, that when the bird comes to eat the fruit its legs are caught, and by pulling the end of the cord, which hangs down to the ground, it comes free from the branch and brings down the bird. Sometimes, when food is abundant elsewhere, the hunter sits from morning till night under his tree with the cord in his hand, and even for two or three whole days in succession, without even getting a bite; while, on the other hand, if very lucky, he may get two or three birds in a day. There are only eight or ten men at Bessir who practise this art, which is unknown anywhere else in the island. I determined, therefore, to stay as long as possible, as my only chance of getting a good series of specimens; and although I was nearly starved, everything eatable by civilized man being scarce or altogether absent, I finally succeeded.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The vegetables and fruit in the plantations around us did not suffice for the wants of the inhabitants, and were almost always dug up or gathered before they were ripe. It was very rarely we could purchase a little fish; fowls there were none; and we were reduced to live upon tough pigeons and cockatoos, with our rice and sago, and sometimes we could not get these. Having been already eight months on this voyage, my stock of all condiments, spices and butter, was exhausted, and I found it impossible to eat sufficient of my tasteless and unpalatable food to support health. I got very thin and weak, and had a curious disease known (I have since heard) as brow-ague. Directly after breakfast every morning an intense pain set in on a small spot on the right temple. It was a severe burning ache, as bad as the worst toothache, and lasted about two hours, generally going off at noon. When this finally ceased, I had an attack of fever, which left me so weak and so unable to eat our regular food, that I feel sure my life was saved by a couple of tins of soup which I had long reserved for some such extremity. I used often to go out searching after vegetables, and found a great treasure in a lot of tomato plants run wild, and bearing little fruits about the size of gooseberries. I also boiled up the tops of pumpkin plants and of ferns, by way of greens, and occasionally got a few green papaws. The natives, when hard up for food, live upon a fleshy seaweed, which they boil till it is tender. I tried this also, but found it too salt and bitter to be endured.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Towards the end of September it became absolutely necessary for me to return, in order to make our homeward voyage before the end of the east monsoon. Most of the men who had taken payment from me had brought the birds they had agreed for. One poor fellow had been so unfortunate as not to get one, and he very honestly brought back the axe he had received in advance; another, who had agreed for six, brought me the fifth two days before I was to start, and went off immediately to the forest again to get the other. He did not return, however, and we loaded our boat, and were just on the point of starting, when he came running down after us holding up a bird, which he handed to me, saying with great satisfaction, \"Now I owe you nothing.\" These were remarkable and quite unexpected instances of honesty among savages, where it would have been very easy for them to have been dishonest without fear of detection or punishment.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The country round about Bessir was very hilly and rugged, bristling with jagged and honey-combed coralline rocks, and with curious little chasms and ravines. The paths often passed through these rocky clefts, which in the depths of the forest were gloomy and dark in the extreme, and often full of fine-leaved herbaceous plants and curious blue-foliaged Lycopodiaceae. It was in such places as these that I obtained many of my most beautiful small butterflies, such as Sospita statira and Taxila pulchra, the gorgeous blue Amblypodia hercules, and many others. On the skirts of the plantations I found the handsome blue Deudorix despoena, and in the shady woods the lovely Lycaena wallacei. Here, too, I obtained the beautiful Thyca aruna, of the richest orange on the upper side; while below it is intense crimson and glossy black; and a superb specimen of a green Ornithoptera, absolutely fresh and perfect, and which still remains one of the glories of my cabinet.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My collection of birds, though not very rich in number of species, was yet very interesting. I got another specimen of the rare New Guinea kite (Henicopernis longicauda), a large new goatsucker (Podargus superciliaris), and a most curious ground- pigeon of an entirely new genus, and remarkable for its long and powerful bill. It has been named Henicophaps albifrons. I was also much pleased to obtain a fine series of a large fruit-pigeon with a protuberance on the bill (Carpophaga tumida), and to ascertain that this was not, as had been hitherto supposed, a sexual character, but was found equally in male and female birds. I collected only seventy-three species of birds in Waigiou, but twelve of them were entirely new, and many others very rare; and as I brought away with me twenty-four fine specimens of the Paradisea rubra, I did not regret my visit to the island, although it had by no means answered my expectations.\\nVOYAGE FROM WAIGIOU TO TERNATE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(SEPTEMBER 29 to NOVEMBER 5, 1860)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I HAD left the old pilot at Waigiou to take care of my house and to get the prau into sailing order--to caulk her bottom, and to look after the upper works, thatch, and ringing. When I returned I found it nearly ready, and immediately began packing up and preparing for the voyage. Our mainsail had formed one side of our house, but the spanker and jib had been put away in the roof, and on opening them to see if any repairs were wanted, to our horror we found that some rats had made them their nest, and had gnawed through them in twenty places. We had therefore to buy matting and make new sails, and this delayed us till the 29th of September, when we at length left Waigiou.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It took us four days before we could get clear of the land, having to pass along narrow straits beset with reefs and shoals, and full of strong currents, so that an unfavourable wind stopped us altogether. One day, when nearly clear, a contrary tide and head wind drove us ten miles back to our anchorage of the night before. This delay made us afraid of running short of water if we should be becalmed at sea, and we therefore determined, if possible, to touch at the island where our men had been lost, and which lay directly in our proper course. The wind was, however, as usual, contrary, being S.S.W. instead of S.S.E., as it should have been at this time of the year, and all we could do was to reach the island of Gagie, where we came to an anchor by moonlight under bare volcanic hills. In the morning we tried to enter a deep bay, at the head of which some Galela fishermen told us there was water, but a head-wind prevented us. For the reward of a handkerchief, however, they took us to the place in their boat, and we filled up our jars and bamboos. We then went round to their camping-place on the north coast of the island to try and buy something to eat, but could only get smoked turtle meat as black and as hard as lumps of coal. A little further on there was a plantation belonging to Guebe people, but under the care of a Papuan slave, and the next morning we got some plantains and a few vegetables in exchange for a handkerchief and some knives. On leaving this place our anchor had got foul in some rock or sunken log in very deep water, and after many unsuccessful attempts, we were forced to cut our rattan cable and leave it behind us. We had now only one anchor left.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Starting early, on the 4th of October, the same S.S.W wind continued, and we began to fear that we should hardly clear the southern point of Gilolo. The night of the 5th was squally, with thunder, but after midnight it got tolerably fair, and we were going along with a light wind arid looking out for the coast of Gilolo, which we thought we must be nearing, when we heard a dull roaring sound, like a heavy surf, behind us. In a short time the roar increased, and we saw a white line of foam coming on, which rapidly passed us without doing any harm, as our boat rose easily over the wave. At short intervals, ten or a dozen others overtook us with bleat rapidity, and then the sea became perfectly smooth, as it was before. I concluded at once that these must be earthquake waves; and on reference to the old voyagers we find that these seas have been long subject to similar phenomena. Dampier encountered them near Mysol and New Guinea, and describes them as follows: \"We found here very strange tides, that ran in streams, making a great sea, and roaring so loud that we could hear them before they came within a mile of us. The sea round about them seemed all broken, and tossed the ship so that she would not answer her helm. These ripplings commonly lasted ten or twelve minutes, and then the sea became as still and smooth as a millpond. We sounded often when in the midst of them, but found no ground, neither could we perceive that they drove us any way. We had in one night several of these tides, that came mostly from the west, and the wind being from that quarter we commonly heard them a long time before they came, and sometimes lowered our topsails, thinking it was a gust of wind. They were of great length, from north to south, but their breadth not exceeding 200 yards, and they drove a great pace. For though we had little wind to move us, yet these world soon pass away, and leave the water very smooth, and just before we encountered them we met a great swell, but it did not break.\" Some time afterwards, I learnt that an earthquake had been felt on the coast of Gilolo the very day we had encountered these curious waves.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When daylight came, we saw the land of Gilolo a few miles off, but the point was unfortunately a little to windward of us. We tried to brace up all we could to round it, but as we approached the shore we got into a strong current setting northward, which carried us so rapidly with it that we found it necessary to stand off again, in order to get out of its influence. Sometimes we approached the point a little, and our hopes revived; then the wind fell, and we drifted slowly away. Night found us in nearly the same position as we had occupied in the morning, so we hung down our anchor with about fifteen fathoms of cable to prevent drifting. On the morning of the 7th we were however, a good way up the coast, and we now thought our only chance would be to got close in-shore, where there might be a return current, and we could then row. The prau was heavy, and my men very poor creatures for work, so that it took us six hours to get to the edge of the reef that fringed the shore; and as the wind might at any moment blow on to it, our situation was a very dangerous one. Luckily, a short distance off there was a sandy bay, where a small stream stopped the growth of the coral; and by evening we reached this and anchored for the night. Here we found some Galela men shooting deer and pigs; but they could not or would not speak Malay, and we could get little information from them. We found out that along shore the current changed with the tide, while about a mile out it was always one way, and against us; and this gave us some hopes of getting back to the point, from which we were now distant twenty miles. Next morning we found that the Galela men had left before daylight, having perhaps some vague fear of our intentions, anal very likely taking me for a pirate. During the morning a boat passed, and the people informed us that, at a short distance further towards the point, there was a much better harbour, where there were plenty of Galela men, from whom we, might probably get some assistance.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At three in the afternoon, when the current turned, we started; but having a head-wind, made slow progress. At dusk we reached the entrance of the harbour, but an eddy and a gust of wind carried us away and out to sea. After sunset there was a land breeze, and we sailed a little to the south-east. It then became calm, and eve hung down our anchor forty fathoms, to endeavour to counteract the current; but it was of little avail, and in the morning we found ourselves a good way from shore, and just opposite our anchorage of the day before, which we again reached by hard rowing. I gave the men this day to rest and sleep; and the next day (Oct. 10th) we again started at two in the morning with a land breeze. After I had set them to their oars, and given instructions to keep close in-shore, and on no account to get out to sea, I went below, being rather unwell. At daybreak I found, to my great astonishment, that we were again far off-shore, and was told that the wind had gradually turned more ahead, and had carried us out--none of them having the sense to take down the sail and row in-shore, or to call me. As soon as it was daylight, we saw that we had drifted back, and were again opposite our former anchorage, and, for the third time, had to row hard to get to it. As we approached the shore, I saw that the current was favourable to us, and we continued down the coast till we were close to the entrance to the lower harbour. Just as we were congratulating ourselves on having at last reached it, a strong south-east squall carne on, blowing us back, and rendering it impossible for us to enter. Not liking the idea of again returning, I determined on trying to anchor, and succeeded in doing so, in very deep water and close to the reefs; but the prevailing winds were such that, should we not hold, we should have no difficulty in getting out to sea. By the time the squall had passed, the current had turned against us, and we expected to have to wait till four in the afternoon, when we intended to enter the harbour.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Now, however, came the climax of our troubles. The swell produced by the squall made us jerk our cable a good deal, and it suddenly snapped low down in the water. We drifted out to sea, and immediately set our mainsail, but we were now without any anchor, and in a vessel so poorly manned that it could not be rowed against the most feeble current or the slightest wind, it word be madness to approach these dangerous shores except in the most perfect calm. We had also only three days\\' food left. It was therefore out of the question making any further attempts to get round the point without assistance, and I at once determined to run to the village of Gani-diluar, about ten miles further north, where we understood there was a good harbour, and where we might get provisions and a few more rowers. Hitherto winds and currents load invariably opposed our passage southward, and we might have expected them to be favourable to us now we had turned our bowsprit in an opposite direction. But it immediately fell calm, and then after a time a westerly land breeze set in, which would not serve us, and we had to row again for hours, and when night came had not reached the village. We were so fortunate, however, as to find a deep sheltered cove where the water was quite smooth, and we constructed a temporary anchor by filling a sack with stones from our ballast, which being well secured by a network of rattans held us safely during the night. The next morning my men went on shore to cut wood suitable for making fresh anchors, and about noon, the current turning in our favour, we proceeded to the village, where we found an excellent and well-protected anchorage.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On inquiry, we found that the head men resided at the other Gani on the western side of the peninsula, and it was necessary to send messengers across (about half a day\\'s journey) to inform them of my arrival, and to beg them to assist me. I then succeeded in buying a little sago, some dried deer-meat and cocoa-nuts, which at once relieved our immediate want of something to eat. At night we found our bag of atones still held us very well, and we slept tranquilly.\\nMALAY ANCHOR\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next day (October 12th), my men set to work making anchors and oars. The native Malay anchor is ingeniously constructed of a piece of tough forked timber, the fluke being strengthened by twisted rattans binding it to the stem, while the cross-piece is formed of a long flat stone, secured in the same manner. These anchors when well made, hold exceedingly arm, and, owing to the expense of iron, are still almost universally used on board the smaller praus. In the afternoon the head men arrived, and promised me as many rowers as I could put on the prau, and also brought me a few eggs and a little rice, which were very acceptable. On the 14th there was a north wind all day, which would have been invaluable to us a few days earlier, but which was now only tantalizing. On the 16th, all being ready, we started at daybreak with two new anchors and ten rowers, who understood their work. By evening we had come more than half-way to the point, and anchored for the night in a small bay. At three the next morning I ordered the anchor up, but the rattan cable parted close to the bottom, having been chafed by rocks, and we then lost our third anchor on this unfortunate voyage. The day was calm, and by noon we passed the southern point of Gilolo, which had delayed us eleven days, whereas the whole voyage during this monsoon should not have occupied more than half that time. Having got round the point our course was exactly in the opposite direction to what it had been, and now, as usual, the wind changed accordingly, coming from the north and north-west,--so that we still had to row every mile up to the village of Gani, which we did not reach till the evening of the 18th. A Bugis trader who was residing there, and the Senaji, or chief, were very kind; the former assisting me with a spare anchor and a cable, and making me a present of some vegetables, and the latter baking fresh sago cakes for my men; and giving rue a couple of fowls, a bottle of oil, and some pumpkins. As the weather was still very uncertain, I got four extra men to accompany me to Ternate, for which place we started on the afternoon of the 20th.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We had to keep rowing all night, the land breezes being too weak to enable us to sail against the current. During the afternoon of the 21st we had an hour\\'s fair wind, which soon changed into a heavy squall with rain, and my clumsy men let the mainsail get taken aback and nearly upset us, tearing the sail; and, what was worse, losing an hour\\'s fair wind. The night was calm, and we made little progress.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 22cd we had light head-winds. A little before noon we passed, with the assistance of our oars, the Paciencia Straits, the narrowest part of the channel between Batchian and Gilolo. These were well named by the early Portuguese navigators, as the currents are very strong, and there are so many eddies, that even with a fair wind vessels are often quite unable to pass through them. In the afternoon a strong north wind (dead ahead) obliged us to anchor twice. At nigh it was calm, and we crept along slowly with our oars.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 23rd we still had the wind ahead, or calms. We then crossed over again to the mainland of Gilolo by the advice of our Gani men, who knew the coast well. Just as we got across we had another northerly squall with rain, and had to anchor on the edge of a coral reef for the night. I called up my men about three on the morning of the 24th, but there was no wind to help us, and we rowed along slowly. At daybreak there was a fair breeze from the south, but it lasted only an hour. All the rest of the day we had nothing but calms, light winds ahead, and squalls, and made very little progress.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 25th we drifted out to the middle of the channel, but made no progress onward. In the afternoon we sailed and rowed to the south end of Kaióa, and by midnight reached the village. I determined to stay here a few days to rest and recruit, and in hopes of getting better weather. I bought some onions and other vegetables, and plenty of eggs, and my men baked fresh sago cakes. I went daily to my old hunting-ground in search of insects, but with very poor success. It was now wet, squally weather, and there appeared a stagnation of insect life. We Staved five days, during which time twelve persons died in the village, mostly from simple intermittent fever, of the treatment of which the natives are quite ignorant. During the whole of this voyage I had suffered greatly from sunburnt lips, owing to having exposed myself on deck all day to loon after our safety among the shoals and reefs near Waigiou. The salt in the air so affected them that they would not heal, but became excessively painful, and bled at the slightest touch, and for a long time it was with great difficulty I could eat at all, being obliged to open my mouth very wide, and put in each mouthful with the greatest caution. I kept them constantly covered with ointment, which was itself very disagreeable, and they caused me almost constant pain for more than a month, as they did not get well till I had returned to Ternate, and was able to remain a week indoors.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A boat which left for Ternate, the day after we arrived, was obliged to return the next day, on account of bad weather. On the 31st we went out to the anchorage at the mouth of the harbour, so as to be ready to start at the first favourable opportunity.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 1st of November I called up my men at one in the morning, and we started with the tide in our favour. Hitherto it had usually been calm at night, but on this occasion we had a strong westerly squall with rain, which turned our prau broadside, and obliged us to anchor. When it had passed we went on rowing all night, but the wind ahead counteracted the current in our favour, and we advanced but little. Soon after sunrise the wind became stronger and more adverse, and as we had a dangerous lee-shore which we could not clear, we had to put about and get an offing to the W.S.W. This series of contrary winds and bad weather ever since we started, not having had a single day of fair wind, was very remarkable. My men firmly believed there was something unlucky in the boat, and told me I ought to have had a certain ceremony gone through before starting, consisting of boring a hole in the bottom and pouring some kind of holy oil through it. It must be remembered that this was the season of the south-east monsoon, and yet we had not had even half a day\\'s south-east wind since we left Waigiou. Contrary winds, squalls, and currents drifted us about the rest of the day at their pleasure. The night was equally squally and changeable, and kept us hard at work taking in and making sail, and rowing in the intervals.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Sunrise on the 2cd found us in the middle of the ten-mile channel between Kaióa and Makian. Squalls and showers succeeded each other during the morning. At noon there was a dead calm, after which a light westerly breeze enabled us to reach a village on Makian in the evening. Here I bought some pumelos (Citrus decumana), kanary-nuts, and coffee, and let my men have a night\\'s sleep.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The morning of the 3rd was fine, and we rowed slowly along the coast of Makian. The captain of a small prau at anchor, seeing me on deck and guessing who I was, made signals for us to stop, and brought me a letter from Charles Allen, who informed me he had been at Ternate twenty days, and was anxiously waiting my arrival. This was good news, as I was equally anxious about him, and it cheered up my spirits. A light southerly wind now sprung up, and we thought we were going to have fine weather. It soon changed, however, to its old quarter, the west; dense clouds gathered over the sky, and in less than half an hour we had the severest squall we had experienced during our whole voyage. Luckily we got our great mainsail down in time, or the consequences might have been serious. It was a regular little hurricane, and my old Bugis steersman began shouting out to \"Allah! il Allah!\" to preserve us. We could only keep up our jib, which was almost blown to rags, but by careful handling it kept us before the wind, and the prau behaved very well. Our small boat (purchased at Gani) was towing astern, and soon got full of water, so that it broke away and we saw no more of it. In about an hour the fury of the wind abated a little, and in two more we were able to hoist our mainsail, reefed and half-mast high. Towards evening it cleared up and fell calm, and the sea, which had been rather high, soon went down. Not being much of a seaman myself I had been considerably alarmed, and even the old steersman assured me he had never been in a worse squall all his life. He was now more than ever confirmed in his opinion of the unluckiness of the boat, and in the efficiency of the holy oil which all Bugis praus had poured through their bottoms. As it was, he imputed our safety and the quick termination of the squall entirely to his own prayers, saying with a laugh, \"Yes, that\\'s the way we always do on board our praus; when things are at the worst we stand up and shout out our prayers as loud as we can, and then Tuwan Allah helps us.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After this it took us two days more to reach Ternate, having our usual calms, squalls, and head-winds to the very last; and once having to return back to our anchorage owing to violent gusts of wind just as we were close to the town. Looking at my whole voyage in this vessel from the time when I left Goram in May, it will appear that rely experiences of travel in a native prau have not been encouraging. My first crew ran away; two men were lost for a month on a desert island; we were ten times aground on coral reefs; we lost four anchors; the sails were devoured by rats; the small boat was lost astern; we were thirty-eight days on the voyage home, which should not have taken twelve; we were many times short of food and water; we had no compass-lamp, owing to there not being a drop of oil in Waigiou when we left; and to crown all, during the whole of our voyages from Goram by Ceram to Waigiou, and from Waigiou to Ternate, occupying in all seventy- eight days, or only twelve days short of three months (all in what was supposed to be the favourable season), we had not one single day of fair wind. We were always close braced up, always struggling against wind, tide, and leeway, and in a vessel that would scarcely sail nearer than eight points from the wind. Every seaman will admit that my first voyage in my own boat was a most unlucky one.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Charles Allen had obtained a tolerable collection of birds and insects at Mysol, but far less than be would have done if I had not been so unfortunate as to miss visiting him. After waiting another week or two till he was nearly starved, he returned to Wahai in Ceram, and heard, much to his surprise, that I had left a fortnight before. He was delayed there more than a month before he could get back to the north side of Mysol, which he found a much better locality, but it was not yet the season for the Paradise Birds; and before he had obtained more than a few of the common sort, the last prau was ready to leave for Ternate, and he was obliged to take the opportunity, as he expected I would be waiting there for him.\\nTHE \"KING\" AND THE \"TWELVE WIRED\" BIRDS OF PARADISE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This concludes the record of my wanderings. I next went to Timor, and afterwards to Bourn, Java, and Sumatra, which places have already been described. Charles Allen made a voyage to New Guinea, a short account of which will be given in my next chapter on the Birds of Paradise. On his return he went to the Sula Islands, and made a very interesting collection which served to determine the limits of the zoological group of Celebes, as already explained in my chapter on the natural history of that island. His next journey was to Flores and Solor, where he obtained some valuable materials, which I have used in my chapter on the natural history of the Timor group. He afterwards went to Coti on the east coast of Borneo, from which place I was very anxious to obtain collections, as it is a quite new locality as far as possible from Sarawak, and I had heard very good accounts of it. On his return thence to Sourabaya in Java, he was to have gone to the entirely unknown Sumba or Sandal-wood Island. Most unfortunately, however, he was seized with a terrible fever on his arrival at Coti, and, after lying there some weeks, was taken to Singapore in a very bad condition, where he arrived after I had left for England. When he recovered he obtained employment in Singapore, and I lost his services as a collector.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The three concluding chapters of my work will treat of the birds of Paradise, the Natural History of the Papuan Islands, and the Races of Man in the Malay Archipelago.\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\nTHE BIRDS OF PARADISE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0AS many of my journeys were made with the express object of obtaining specimens of the Birds of Paradise, and learning something of their habits and distribution; and being (as far as I am aware) the only Englishman who has seen these wonderful birds in their native forests, and obtained specimens of many of them, I propose to give here, in a connected form, the result of my observations and inquiries.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When the earliest European voyagers reached the Moluccas in search of cloves and nutmegs, which were then rare and precious spices, they were presented with the dried shins of birds so strange and beautiful as to excite the admiration even of those wealth-seeking rovers. The Malay traders gave them the name of \"Manuk dewata,\" or God\\'s birds; and the Portuguese, finding that they had no feet or wings, and not being able to learn anything authentic about then, called them \"Passaros de Col,\" or Birds of the Sun; while the learned Dutchmen, who wrote in Latin, called them \"Avis paradiseus,\" or Paradise Bird. John van Linschoten gives these names in 1598, and tells us that no one has seen these birds alive, for they live in the air, always turning towards the sun, and never lighting on the earth till they die; for they have neither feet nor wings, as, he adds, may be seen by the birds carried to India, and sometimes to Holland, but being very costly they were then rarely seen in Europe. More than a hundred years later Mr. William Funnel, who accompanied Dampier, and wrote an account of the voyage, saw specimens at Amboyna, and was told that they came to Banda to eat nutmegs, which intoxicated them and made them fall down senseless, when they were killed by ants. Down to 1760, when Linnaeus named the largest species, Paradisea apoda (the footless Paradise Bird), no perfect specimen had been seen in Europe, and absolutely nothing was known about them. And even now, a hundred years later, most books state that they migrate annually to Ternate, Banda, and Amboyna; whereas the fact is, that they are as completely unknown in those islands in a wild state as they are in England. Linnaeus was also acquainted with a small species, which he named Paradisea regia (the King Bird of Paradise), and since then nine or ten others have been named, all of which were first described from skins preserved by the savages of New Guinea, and generally more or less imperfect. These are now all known in the Malay Archipelago as \"Burong coati,\" or dead birds, indicating that the Malay traders never saw them alive.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Paradiseidae are a group of moderate-sized birds, allied in their structure and habits to crows, starlings, and to the Australian honeysuckers; but they are characterised by extraordinary developments of plumage, which are unequalled in any other family of birds. In several species large tufts of delicate bright-coloured feathers spring from each side of the body beneath the wings, forming trains, or fans, or shields; and the middle feathers of the tail are often elongated into wires, twisted into fantastic shapes, or adorned with the most brilliant metallic tints. In another set of species these accessory plumes spring from the head, the back, or the shoulders; while the intensity of colour and of metallic lustre displayed by their plumage, is not to be equalled by any other birds, except, perhaps, the humming-birds, and is not surpassed even by these. They have been usually classified under two distinct families, Paradiseidae and Epimachidae, the latter characterised by long and slender beaks, and supposed to be allied to the Hoopoes; but the two groups are so closely allied in every essential point of structure and habits, that I shall consider them as forming subdivisions of one family. I will now give a short description of each of the known species, and then add some general remarks on their natural history.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Great Bird of Paradise (Paradisea apoda of Linnaeus) is the largest species known, being generally seventeen or eighteen inches from the beak to the tip of the tail. The body, wings, and tail are of a rich coffee-brown, which deepens on the breast to a blackish-violet or purple-brown. The whole top of the head and neck is of an exceedingly delicate straw-yellow, the feathers being short and close set, so as to resemble plush or velvet; the lower part of the throat up to the eye clothed with scaly feathers of an emerald, green colour, and with a rich metallic gloss, and velvety plumes of a still deeper green extend in a band across the forehead and chin as far as the eye, which is bright yellow. The beak is pale lead blue; and the feet, which are rather large and very strong and well formed, are of a pale ashy-pink. The two middle feathers of the tail have no webs, except a very small one at the base and at the extreme tip, forming wire-like cirrhi, which spread out in an elegant double curve, and vary from twenty-four to thirty-four inches long. From each side of the body, beneath the wings, springs a dense tuft of long and delicate plumes, sometimes two feet in length, of the most intense golden-orange colour and very glossy, but changing towards the tips into a pale brown. This tuft of plumage cam be elevated and spread out at pleasure, so as almost to conceal the body of the bird.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0These splendid ornaments are entirely confined to the male sex, while the female is really a very plain and ordinary-looking bird of a uniform coffee-brown colour which never changes, neither does she possess the long tail wires, nor a single yellow or green feather about the dead. The young males of the first year exactly resemble the females, so that they can only be distinguished by dissection. The first change is the acquisition of the yellow and green colour on the head and throat, and at the same time the two middle tail feathers grow a few inches longer than the rest, but remain webbed on both sides. At a later period these feathers arc replaced by the long bare shafts of the full length, as in the adult bird; but there is still no sign of the magnificent orange side-plumes, which later still complete the attire of the perfect male. To effect these changes there must be at least three successive moultings; and as the birds were found by me in all the stages about the same time, it is probable that they moult only once a year, and that the full plumage is not acquired till the bird is four years old. It was long thought that the fine train of feathers was assumed for a short time only at the breeding season, but my own experience, as well as the observation of birds of an allied species which I brought home with me, and which lived two years in this country, show that the complete plumage is retained during the whole year, except during a short period of moulting as with most other birds.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Great Bird of Paradise is very active and vigorous and seems to be in constant motion all day long. It is very abundant, small flocks of females and young male being constantly met with; and though the full-plumaged birds are less plentiful, their loud cries, which are heard daily, show that they also are very numerous. Their note is, \"Wawk-wawk-wawk-Wok-wok-wok,\" and is so loud and shrill as to be heard a great distance, and to form the most prominent and characteristic animal sound in the Aru Islands. The mode of nidification is unknown; but the natives told me that the nest was formed of leaves placed on an ant\\'s nest, or on some projecting limb of a very lofty tree, and they believe that it contains only one young bird. The egg is quite unknown, and the natives declared they had never seen it; and a very high reward offered for one by a Dutch official did not meet with success. They moult about January or February, and in May, when they are in full plumage, the males assemble early in the morning to exhibit themselves in the singular manner already described at p. 252. This habit enables the natives to obtain specimens with comparative ease. As soon as they find that the birds have fled upon a tree on which to assemble, they build a little shelter of palm leaves in a convenient place among the branches, and the hunter ensconces himself in it before daylight, armed with his bow and a number of arrows terminating in a round knob. A boy waits at the foot of the tree, and when the birds come at sunrise, and a sufficient number have assembled, and have begun to dance, the hunter shoots with his blunt arrow so strongly as to stun the bird, which drops down, and is secured and killed by the boy without its plumage being injured by a drop of blood. The rest take no notice, and fall one after another till some of them take the alarm. (See Frontispiece.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The native mode of preserving them is to cut off the wings and feet, and then skin the body up to the beak, taking out the skull. A stout stick is then run up through the specimen coming out at the mouth. Round this some leaves are stuffed, and the whole is wrapped up in a palm spathe and dried in the smoky hut. By this plan the head, which is really large, is shrunk up almost to nothing, the body is much reduced and shortened, and the greatest prominence is given to the flowing plumage. Some of these native skins are very clean, and often have wings and feet left on; others are dreadfully stained with smoke, and all hive a most erroneous idea of the proportions of the living bird.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Paradisea apoda, as far as we have any certain knowledge, is confined to the mainland of the Aru Islands, never being found in the smaller islands which surround the central mass. It is certainly not found in any of the parts of New Guinea visited by the Malay and Bugis traders, nor in any of the other islands where Birds of Paradise are obtained. But this is by no means conclusive evidence, for it is only in certain localities that the natives prepare skins, and in other places the same birds may be abundant without ever becoming known. It is therefore quite possible that this species may inhabit the great southern mass of New Guinea, from which Aru has been separated; while its near ally, which I shall next describe, is confined to the north- western peninsula.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Lesser Bird of Paradise (Paradisea papuana of Bechstein), \"Le petit Emeraude\" of French authors, is a much smaller bird than the preceding, although very similar to it. It differs in its lighter brown colour, not becoming darker or purpled on the breast; in the extension of the yellow colour all over the upper part of the back and on the wing coverts; in the lighter yellow of the side plumes, which have only a tinge of orange, and at the tips are nearly pure white; and in the comparative shortness of the tail cirrhi. The female differs remarkably front the same sex in Paradisea apoda, by being entirely white on the under surface of the body, and is thus a much handsomer bird. The young males are similarly coloured, and as they grow older they change to brown, and go through the same stages in acquiring the perfect plumage as has already been described in the allied species. It is this bird which is most commonly used in ladies\\' head-dresses in this country, and also forms an important article of commerce in the East.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Paradisea papuana has a comparatively wide range, being the common species on the mainland of New Guinea, as well as on the islands of Mysol, Salwatty, Jobie, Biak and Sook. On the south coast of New Guinea, the Dutch naturalist, Muller, found it at the Oetanata river in longitude 136° E. I obtained it myself at Dorey; and the captain of the Dutch steamer Etna informed me that he had seen the feathers among the natives of Humboldt Bay, in 141° E. longitude. It is very probable, therefore, that it ranges over the whole of the mainland of New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The true Paradise Birds are omnivorous, feeding on fruits and insects--of the former preferring the small figs; of the latter, grasshoppers, locusts, and phasmas, as well as cockroaches and caterpillars. When I returned home, in 1862, I was so fortunate as to find two adult males of this species in Singapore; and as they seemed healthy, and fed voraciously on rice, bananas, and cockroaches, I determined on giving the very high price asked for them--£100.--and to bring them to England by the overland route under my own care. On my way home I stayed a week at Bombay, to break the journey, and to lay in a fresh stock of bananas for my birds. I had great difficulty, however, in supplying them with insect food, for in the Peninsular and Oriental steamers cockroaches were scarce, and it was only by setting traps in the store-rooms, and by hunting an hour every night in the forecastle, that I could secure a few dozen of these creatures,-- scarcely enough for a single meal. At Malta, where I stayed a fortnight, I got plenty of cockroaches from a bake-house, and when I left, took with me several biscuit-tins\\' full, as provision for the voyage home. We came through the Mediterranean in March, with a very cold wind; and the only place on board the mail-steamer where their large cage could be accommodated was exposed to a strong current of air down a hatchway which stood open day and night, yet the birds never seemed to feel the cold. During the night journey from Marseilles to Paris it was a sharp frost; yet they arrived in London in perfect health, and lived in the Zoological Gardens for one, and two years, often displaying their beautiful plumes to the admiration of the spectators. It is evident, therefore, that the Paradise Birds are very hardy, and require air and exercise rather than heat; and I feel sure that if a good sized conservators` could be devoted to them, or if they could be turned loose in the tropical department of the Crystal Palace or the Great Palm House at Kew, they would live in this country for many years.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Red Bird of Paradise (Paradisea rubra of Viellot), though allied to the two birds already described, is much more distinct from them than they are from each other. It is about the same size as Paradisea papuana (13 to 14 inches long), but differs from it in many particulars. The side plumes, instead of being yellow, are rich crimson, and only extend about three or four inches beyond the end of the tail; they are somewhat rigid, and the ends are curved downwards and inwards, and are tipped with white. The two middle tail feathers, instead of being simply elongated and deprived of their webs, are transformed into stiff black ribands, a quarter of an inch wide, but curved like a split quill, and resembling thin half cylinders of horn or whalebone. When a dead bird is laid on its back, it is seen that these ribands take a curve or set, which brings them round so as to meet in a double circle on the neck of the bird; but when they hang downwards, during life, they assume a spiral twist, and form an exceedingly graceful double curve. They are about twenty-two inches long, and always attract attention as the most conspicuous and extraordinary feature of the species. The rich metallic green colour of the throat extends over the front half of the head to behind the eyes, and on the forehead forms a little double crest of scaly feathers, which adds much to the vivacity of the bird\\'s aspect. The bill is gamboge yellow, and the iris blackish olive. (Figure at p. 353.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The female of this species is of a tolerably uniform coffee-brown colour, but has a blackish head, and the nape neck, and shoulders yellow, indicating the position of the brighter colours of the male. The changes of plumage follow the same order of succession as in the other species, the bright colours of the head and neck being first developed, then the lengthened filaments of the tail, and last of all, the red side plumes. I obtained a series of specimens, illustrating the manner in which the extraordinary black tail ribands are developed, which is very remarkable. They first appear as two ordinary feathers, rather shorter than the rest of the tail; the second stage would no doubt be that shown in a specimen of Paradisea apoda, in which the feathers are moderately lengthened, and with the web narrowed in the middle; the third stage is shown by a specimen which has part of the midrib bare, and terminated by a spatulate web; in another the bare midrib is a little dilated and semi-cylindrical, and the terminal web very small; in a fifth, the perfect black horny riband is formed, but it bears at its extremity a brown spatulate web, while in another a portion of the black riband itself bears, for a portion of its length, a narrow brown web. It is only after these changes are fully completed that the red side plumes begin to appear.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The successive stages of development of the colours and plumage of the Birds of Paradise are very interesting, from the striking manner in which they accord with the theory of their having been produced by the simple action of variation, and the cumulative power of selection by the females, of those male birds which were more than usually ornamental. [footnote: I have since arrived at the conclusion that female selection is not the cause of the development of the ornamental plumes in the males. See my Darwinism, Chap. X.] Variations of _colour_ are of all others the most frequent and the most striking, and are most easily modified and accumulated by man\\'s selection of them. We should expect, therefore, that the sexual differences of _colour_ would be those most early accumulated and fixed, and would therefore appear soonest in the young birds; and this is exactly what occurs in the Paradise Birds. Of all variations in the _form_ of birds\\' feathers, none are so frequent as those in the head and tail. These occur more, or less in every family of birds, and are easily produced in many domesticated varieties, while unusual developments of the feathers of the body are rare in the whole class of birds, and have seldom or never occurred in domesticated species. In accordance with these facts, we find the scale-formed plumes of the throat, the crests of the head, and the long cirrhi of the tail, all fully developed before the plumes which spring from the side of the body begin to mane their appearance. If, on the other hand, the male Paradise Birds have not acquired their distinctive plumage by successive variations, but have been as they are mow from the moment they first appeared upon the earth, this succession becomes at the least unintelligible to us, for we can see no reason why the changes should not take place simultaneously, or in a reverse order to that in which they actually occur.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What is known of the habits of this bird, and the way in which it is captured by the natives, have already been described at page 362.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Red Bird of Paradise offers a remarkable case of restricted range, being entirely confined to the small island of Waigiou, off the north-west extremity of New Guinea, where it replaces the allied species found in the other islands. [footnote: This species is said by Dr. Guillemard to be found also in the island of Batanta. (Cruise of the Marchesa, Vol II, p.225).]\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The three birds just described form a well-marked group, agreeing in every point of general structure, in their comparatively large size, the brown colour of their bodies, wings, and tail, and in the peculiar character of the ornamental  plumage which distinguishes the male bird. The group ranges nearly over the whole area inhabited by the family of the Paradiseidae, but each of the species has its own limited region, and is never found in the same district with either of its close allies. To these three birds properly belongs the generic title Paradisea, or true Paradise Bird. [footnote: Three very distinct new species of Paradisea have since been discovered in Southeastern New Guinea, and two other less distinct local forms.]\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next species is the Paradisea regia of Linnaeus, or Ding Bird of Paradise, which differs so much from the three preceding species as to deserve a distinct generic name, and it has accordingly been called Cicinnurus regius. By the Malays it is called \"Burong rajah,\" or King Bird, and by the natives of the Aru Islands \"Goby-goby.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This lovely little bird is only about six and a half inches long, partly owing to the very short tail, which does not surpass the somewhat square wings. The head, throat, and entire upper surface are of the richest glossy crimson red, shading to orange-crimson on the forehead, where the feathers extend beyond the nostrils more than half-way down the beak. The plumage is excessively brilliant, shining in certain lights with a metallic or glassy lustre. The breast and belly are pure silky white, between which colour and the red of the throat there is a broad band of rich metallic green, and there is a small spot of the same colour close above each eye. From each side of the body beneath the wing, springs a tuft of broad delicate feathers about an inch and a half long, of an ashy colour, but tipped with a broad band of emerald green, bordered within by a narrow line of buff: These plumes are concealed beneath the wing, but when the bird pleases, can be raised and spread out so as to form an elegant semicircular fan on each shoulder. But another ornament still more extraordinary, and if possible more beautiful, adorns this little bird. The two middle tail feathers are modified into very slender wirelike shafts, nearly six inches long, each of which bears at the extremity, on the inner side only, a web of an emerald green colour, which is coiled up into a perfect spiral disc, and produces a most singular and charming effect. The bill is orange yellow, and the feet and legs of a fine cobalt blue. (See upper figure on the plate at the commencement of this chapter.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The female of this little gem is such a plainly coloured bird, that it can at first sight hardly be believed to belong to the same species. The upper surface is of a dull earthy brown, a slight tinge of orange red appearing only on the margins of the quills. Beneath, it is of a paler yellowish brown, scaled and banded with narrow dusky markings. The young males are exactly like the female, and they no doubt undergo a series of changes as singular as those of Paradisea rubra; but, unfortunately, I was unable to obtain illustrative specimens.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This exquisite little creature frequents the smaller trees in the thickest parts of the forest, feeding on various fruits; often of a very large size for so small a bird. It is very active both on its wings and feet, and makes a whirring sound while flying, something like the South American manakins. It often flutters its wings and displays the beautiful fan which adorns its breast, while the star-bearing tail wires diverge in an elegant double curve. It is tolerably plentiful in the Aru Islands, which led to it, being brought to Europe at an early period along with Paradisea apoda. It also occurs in the island of Mysol and in every part of New Guinea which has been visited by naturalists.\\nTHE MAGNIFICENT BIRD OF PARADISE (Diphyllodes speciosa.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now come to the remarkable little bird called the \"Magnificent,\" first figured by Buffon, and named Paradisea speciosa by Boddaert, which, with one allied species, has been formed into a separate genus by Prince Buonaparte, under the name of Diphyllodes, from the curious double mantle which clothes the back.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The head is covered with short brown velvety feathers, which advance on the back so as to cover the nostrils. From the nape springs a dense mass of feathers of a straw-yellow colour, and about one and a half inches long, forming a mantle over the upper part of the back. Beneath this, and forming a band about one- third of an inch beyond it, is a second mantle of rich, glossy, reddish-brown fathers. The rest of the bath is orange-brown, the tail-coverts and tail dark bronzy, the wings light orange-buff: The whole under surface is covered with an abundance of plumage springing from the margins of the breast, and of a rich deep green colour, with changeable hues of purple. Down the middle of the breast is a broad band of scaly plumes of the same colour, while the chin and throat are of a rich metallic bronze. From the middle of the tail spring two narrow feathers of a rich steel blue, and about ten inches long. These are webbed on the inner side only, and curve outward, so as to form a double circle.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0From what we know of the habits of allied species, we may be sure that the greatly developed plumage of this bird is erected and displayed in some remarkable manner. The mass of feathers on the under surface are probably expanded into a hemisphere, while the beautiful yellow mantle is no doubt elevated so as to give the bird a very different appearance from that which it presents in the dried and flattened skins of the natives, through which alone it is at present known. The feet appear to be dark blue.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This rare and elegant little bird is found only on the mainland of New Guinea, and in the island of Mysol.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A still more rare and beautiful species than the last is the Diphyllodes wilsoni, described by Mr. Cassin from a native skin in the rich museum of Philadelphia. The same bird was afterwards named \"Diphyllodes respublica\" by Prince Buonaparte, and still later, \"Schlegelia calva,\" by Dr. Bernstein, who was so fortunate as to obtain fresh specimens in Waigiou.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In this species the upper mantle is sulphur yellow, the lower one and the wings pure red, the breast plumes dark green, and the lengthened middle tail feathers much shorter than in the allied species. The most curious difference is, however, that the top of the head is bald, the bare skin being of a rich cobalt blue, crossed by several lines of black velvety feathers.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is about the same size as Diphyllodes speciosa, and is no doubt entirely confined to the island of Waigiou. The female, as figured and described by Dr. Bernstein, is very like that of Cicinnurus regius, being similarly banded beneath; and we may therefore conclude that its near ally, the \"Magnificent,\" is at least equally plain in this sex, of which specimens have not yet been obtained.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Superb Bird of Paradise was first figured by Buffon, and was named by Boddaert, Paradisea atra, from the black ground colour of its plumage. It forms the genus Lophorina of Viellot, and is one of the rarest and most brilliant of the whole group, being only known front mutilated native skins. This bird is a little larger than the Magnificent. The ground colour of the plumage is intense black, but with beautiful bronze reflections on the neck, and the whole head scaled with feathers of brilliant metallic green and blue. Over its breast it bears a shield formed of narrow and rather stiff feathers, much elongated towards the sides, of a pure bluish-green colour, and with a satiny gloss. But a still more extraordinary ornament is that which springs from the back of the neck,--a shield of a similar form to that on the breast, but much larger, and of a velvety black colour, glossed with bronze and purple. The outermost feathers of this shield are half an inch longer than the wing, and when it is elevated it must, in conjunction with the breast shield, completely change the form and whole appearance of the bird. The bill is black, and the feet appear to be yellow.\\nTHE SUPERB BIRD OF PARADISE (Lophorina atra.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This wonderful little bird inhabits the interior of the northern peninsula of New Guinea only. Neither I nor Mr. Allen could hear anything of it in any of the islands or on any part of the coast. It is true that it was obtained from the coast-natives by Lesson; but when at Sorong in 1861, Mr. Allen learnt that it is only found three days\\' journey in the interior. Owing to these \"Black Birds of Paradise,\" as they are called, not being so much valued as articles of merchandise, they now seem to be rarely preserved by the natives, and it thus happened that during several years spent on the coasts of New Guinea and in the Moluccas I was never able to obtain a skin. We are therefore quite ignorant of the habits of this bird, and also of its female, though the latter is no doubt as plain and inconspicuous as in all the other species of this family.\\nTHE SIX-SHAFTED BIRD OF PARADISE (Parotia sexpennis.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Golden, or Six-shafted, Paradise Bird, is another rare species, first figured by Buffon, and never yet obtained in perfect condition. It was named by Boddaert, Paradisea sexpennis, and forms the genus Parotia of Viellot. This wonderful bird is about the size of the female Paradisea rubra. The plumage appear, at first sight black, but it glows in certain light with bronze and deep purple. The throat and breast are scaled with broad flat feathers of an intense golden hue, changing to green and blue tints in certain lights. On the back of the head is a broad recurved band of feathers, whose brilliancy is indescribable, resembling the sheen of emerald and topaz rather than any organic substance. Over the forehead is a large patch of pure white feathers, which shine like satin; and from the sides of the head spring the six wonderful feathers from which the bird receives its name. These are slender wires, six inches long, with a small oval web at the extremity. In addition to these ornaments, there is also an immense tuft of soft feathers on each side of the breast, which when elevated must entirely hide the wings, and give the bird au appearance of being double its real bulk. The bill is black, short, and rather compressed, with the feathers advancing over the nostrils, as in Cicinnurus regius. This singular and brilliant bird inhabits the same region as the Superb Bird of Paradise, and nothing whatever is known about it but what we can derive from an examination of the skins preserved by the natives of New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Standard Wing, named Semioptera wallacei by Mr. G. R. Gray, is an entirely new form of Bird of Paradise, discovered by myself in the island of Batchian, and especially distinguished by a pair of long narrow feathers of a white colour, which spring from among the short plumes which clothe the bend of the wing, and are capable of being erected at pleasure. The general colour of this bird is a delicate olive-brown, deepening to a loud of bronzy olive in the middle of the back, and changing to a delicate ashy violet with a metallic gloss, on the crown of the head. The feathers, which cover the nostrils and extend half-way down the beak, are loose and curved upwards. Beneath, it is much more beautiful. The scale-like feathers of the breast are margined with rich metallic blue-green, which colour entirely covers the throat and sides of the neck, as well as the long pointed plumes which spring from the sides of the breast, and extend nearly as far as the end of the wings. The most curious feature of the bird, however, and one altogether unique in the whole class, is found in the pair of long narrow delicate feathers which spring from each wing close to the bend. On lifting the wing-coverts they are seen to arise from two tubular horny sheaths, which diverge from near the point of junction of the carpal bones. As already described at p. 41, they are erectile, and when the bird is excited are spread out at right angles to the wing and slightly divergent. They are from six to six and a half inches long, the upper one slightly exceeding the lower. The total length of the bird is eleven inches. The bill is horny olive, the iris deep olive, and the feet bright orange.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The female bird is remarkably plain, being entirely of a dull pale earthy brown, with only a slight tinge of ashy violet on the head to relieve its general monotony; and the young males exactly resemble her. (See figures at p. 41.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This bird, frequents the lower trees of the forests, and, like most Paradise Birds, is in constant motion--flying from branch to branch, clinging to the twigs and even to the smooth and vertical trunks almost as easily as a woodpecker. It continually utters a harsh, creaking note, somewhat intermediate between that of Paradisea apoda, and the more musical cry of Cicinnurus regius. The males at short intervals open and flutter their wings, erect the long shoulder feathers, and spread out the elegant green breast shields.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Standard Wing is found in Gilolo as well as in Batchian, and all the specimens from the former island have the green breast shield rather longer, the crown of the head darker violet, and the lower parts of the body rather more strongly scaled with green. This is the only Paradise Bird yet found in the Moluccan district, all the others being confined to the Papuan Islands and North Australia.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now come to the Epimachidae, or Long-billed Birds of Paradise, which, as before stated, ought not to be separated from the Paradiseidae by the intervention of any other birds. One of the most remarkable of these is the Twelve-wired Paradise Bird, Paradises alba of Blumenbach, but now placed in the genus Seleucides of Lesson.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This bird is about twelve inches long, of which the compressed and curved beak occupies two inches. The colour of the breast and upper surface appears at first sight nearly black, but a close examination shows that no part of it is devoid of colour; and by holding it in various lights, the most rich and glowing tints become visible. The head, covered with short velvety feathers, which advance on the chic much further than on the upper part of the beak, is of a purplish bronze colour; the whole of the back and shoulders is rich bronzy green, while the closed wings and tail are of the most brilliant violet purple, all the plumage having a delicate silky gloss. The mass of feathers which cover the breast is really almost black, with faint glosses of green and purple, but their outer edges are margined with glittering bands of emerald green. The whole lower part of the body is rich buffy yellow, including the tuft of plumes which spring from the sides, and extend an inch and a half beyond the tail. When skins are exposed to the light the yellow fades into dull white, from which circumstance it derived its specific name. About six of the innermost of these plumes on each side have the midrib elongated into slender black wires, which bend at right angles, and curve somewhat backwards to a length of about ten inches, forming one of those extraordinary and fantastic ornaments with which this group of birds abounds. The bill is jet black, and the feet bright yellow. (See lower figure on the plate at the beginning of this chapter).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The female, although not quite so plain a bird as in some other species, presents none of the gay colours or ornamental plumage of the male. The top of the head and back of the neck are black, the rest of the upper parts rich reddish brown; while the under surface is entirely yellowish ashy, somewhat blackish on the breast, and crossed throughout with narrow blackish wavy bands.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Seleucides alba is found in the island of Salwatty, and in the north-western parts of New Guinea, where it frequents flowering trees, especially sago-palms and pandani, sucking the flowers, round and beneath which its unusually large and powerful feet enable it to cling. Its motions are very rapid. It seldom rests more than a few moments on one tree, after which it flies straight off, and with great swiftness, to another. It has a loud shrill cry, to be heard a long way, consisting of \"Cah, cah,\" repeated five or six times in a descending scale, and at the last note it generally flies away. The males are quite solitary in their habits, although, perhaps, they assemble at pertain times like the true Paradise Birds. All the specimens shot and opened by my assistant Mr. Allen, who obtained this fine bird during his last voyage to New Guinea, had nothing in their stomachs but a brown sweet liquid, probably the nectar of the flowers on which they had been feeding. They certainly, however, eat both fruit and insects, for a specimen which I saw alive on board a Dutch steamer ate cockroaches and papaya fruit voraciously. This bird had the curious habit of resting at noon with the bill pointing vertically upwards. It died on the passage to Batavia, and I secured the body and formed a skeleton, which shows indisputably that it is really a Bird of Paradise. The tongue is very long and extensible, but flat and little fibrous at the end, exactly like the true Paradiseas.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the island of Salwatty, the natives search in the forests till they find the sleeping place of this bird, which they know by seeing its dung upon the ground. It is generally in a low bushy tree. At night they climb up the trap, and either shoot the birds with blunt arrows, or even catch them alive with a cloth. In New Guinea they are caught by placing snares on the trees frequented by them, in the same way as the Red Paradise birds are caught in Waigiou, and which has already been described at page 362.\\nTHE LONG-TAILED BIRD OF PARADISE (Epimachus magnus.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The great Epimaque, or Long-tailed Paradise Bird (Epimachus magnus), is another of these wonderful creatures, only known by the imperfect skins prepared by the natives. In its dark velvety plumage, glowed with bronze and purple, it resembles the Seleucides alba, but it bears a magnificent tail more than two feet long, glossed on the upper surface with the most intense opalescent blue. Its chief ornament, however, consists in the group of broad plumes which spring from the sides of the breast, and which are dilated at the extremity, and banded with the most vivid metallic blue and green. The bill is long and curved, and the feet black, and similar to those of the allied forms. The total length of this fine bird is between three and four feet.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This splendid bird inhabits the mountains of New Guinea, in the same district with the Superb and the Six-shafted Paradise Birds, and I was informed is sometimes found in the ranges near the coast. I was several times assured by different natives that this bird makes its nest in a hole under ground, or under rocks, always choosing a place with two apertures, so that it may enter at one and go out at the other. This is very unlike what we should suppose to be the habits of the bird, but it is not easy to conceive how the story originated if it is not true; and all travellers know that native accounts of the habits of animals, however strange they may seem, almost invariably turn out to be correct.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Scale-breasted Paradise Bird (Epimachus magnificus of Cuvier) is now generally placed with the Australian Rifle birds in the genus Ptiloris. Though very beautiful, these birds are less strikingly decorated with accessory plumage than the other species we have been describing, their chief ornament being a more or less developed breastplate of stiff metallic green feathers, and a small tuft of somewhat hairy plumes on the sides of the breast. The back and wings of this species are of an intense velvety black, faintly glossed in certain lights with rich purple. The two broad middle tail feathers are opalescent green-blue with a velvety surface, and the top of the head is covered with feathers resembling scales of burnished steel. A large triangular space covering the chin, throat, and breast, is densely scaled with feathers, having a steel-blue or green lustre, and a silky feel. This is edged below with a narrow band of black, followed by shiny bronzy green, below which the body is covered with hairy feathers of a rich claret colour, deepening to black at the tail. The tufts of side plumes somewhat resemble those of the true Birds of Paradise, but are scanty, about as long as the tail, and of a black colour. The sides of the head are rich violet, and velvety feathers extend on each side of the beak over the nostrils.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I obtained at Dorey a young male of this bird, in a state of plumage which is no doubt that of the adult female, as is the case in all the allied species. The upper surface, wings, and tail are rich reddish brown, while the under surface is of a pale ashy colour, closely barred throughout with narrow wavy black bands. There is also a pale banded stripe over the eye, and a long dusky stripe from the gape down each side of the neck. This bird is fourteen inches long, whereas the native skins of the adult male are only about ten inches, owing to the way in which the tail is pushed in, so as to give as much prominence as possible to the ornamental plumage of the breast.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At Cape York, in North Australia, there is a closely allied species, Ptiloris alberti, the female of which is very similar to the young male bird here described. The beautiful Rifle Birds of Australia, which much resemble those Paradise Birds, are named Ptiloris paradiseus and Ptiloris victories, The Scale-breasted Paradise Bird seems to be confined to the mainland of New Guinea, and is less rare than several of the other species.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There are three other New Guinea birds which are by some authors classed with the Birds of Paradise, and which, being almost equally remarkable for splendid plumage, deserve to be noticed here. The first is the Paradise pie (Astrapia nigra of Lesson), a bird of the size of Paradises rubra, but with a very long tail, glossed above with intense violet. The back is bronzy black, the lower parts green, the throat and neck bordered with loose broad feathers of an intense coppery hue, while on the top of the head and neck they are glittering emerald green, All the plumage round the head is lengthened and erectile, and when spread out by the living bird must lave an effect hardly surpassed by any of the true Paradise birds. The bill is black and the feet yellow. The Astrapia seems to me to be somewhat intermediate between the Paradiseidae and Epimachidae.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There is an allied species, having a bare carunculated head, which has been called Paradigalla carunculata. It is believed to inhabit, with the preceding, the mountainous, interior of New Guinea, but is exceedingly rare, the only known specimen being in the Philadelphia Museum.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Paradise Oriole is another beautiful bird, which is now sometimes classed with the Birds of Paradise. It has been named Paradises aurea and Oriolus aureus by the old naturalists, and is now generally placed in the same genus as the Regent Bird of Australia (Sericulus chrysocephalus). But the form of the bill and the character of the plumage seem to me to be so different that it will have to form a distinct genus. This bird is almost entirely yellow, with the exception of the throat, the tail, and part of the wings and back, which are black; but it is chiefly characterised by a quantity of long feathers of an intense glossy orange colour, which cover its neck down to the middle of the back, almost like the hackles of a game-cock.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This beautiful bird inhabits the mainland of New Guinea, and is also found in Salwatty, but is so rare that I was only able to obtain one imperfect native skin, and nothing whatever is known of its habits.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I will now give a list of all the Birds of Paradise yet known, with the places they are believed to inhabit.\\nPARADISEA APODA (The Great Paradise Bird).

      "[1.1386552408509952e-05, 'Eleno O. Peralta [30]\\nABSTRACT\\nDeforestation has taken on alarming proportions in the Philippines during the post Second World War decades, and it is now among the six countries that account for three-quarters of recent deforestation in the region. The Philippine government has formulated the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) for 2001- 2004 of which a key component is the Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM), a national strategy in managing the forestlands resources and seeks to address the interlinked problem of forest destruction and upland poverty. While forestry research in the Philippines is handled principally by government research agencies, there are also non-governmental organizations (NGO) and academe-based research institutions that conduct various related researches. The Forestry Development Center (FDC) based at the College of Forestry and Natural Resources (CFNR) of the University of the Philippines at Los Baños, was established to conduct basic policy researches in forestry and develop, or help develop, an effective machinery for forestry policy formulation and implementation. In view of changing demands for research on poverty reduction, especially in the uplands, the research thrusts of FDC have shifted to focus on areas such as improvement of the socio-economic well-being of the upland farmers and harnessing forests for poverty eradication.\\nTHE PHILIPPINE FORESTRY SECTOR\\nThe Philippines has a total land area of slightly less than 30 million ha. From a high of 21 million ha in 1900 (70 percent of land area), the country\\'s forest cover was reduced to 5.5 million ha in 1999 (18.3 percent). Deforestation has taken on alarming proportions in the Philippines during the post Second World War decades. The scenario for 2010 has been described as \"nothing short of disastrous\" with the country\\'s forest cover reaching a low of 6.6 percent of the total land area.\\nThe UN Commission on Sustainable Development through the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF) identified the following causes: poverty, lack of secure land tenure patterns, inadequate recognition of the rights and needs of forest-dependent indigenous and local communities within national laws and jurisdiction, inadequate cross-sectoral policies, lack of participation, lack of good governance, absence of supportive economic climate that supports sustainable forest management, lack of capacity, among other factors. These are the same factors contributing to the massive destruction of the forests during the past two decades: the tremendous pressure from an increasing population in search of land; ever increasing demand of fuelwood; the over-exploitation of timber resources; and inadequate forest development, management and conservation efforts. Consequently, soil degradation due to massive conversion of forestlands and grasslands to urban use and increased cultivation in upland areas remains a big problem. It was estimated that 45 percent of the country\\'s total land area suffers from moderate to severe soil erosion, most of which is still unabated (MTPDP 2001- 2004).\\nMeanwhile, poor rural households have increased with the poverty incidence at a high 28.4 percent in 2000. This means that more than one-third of the country\\'s population is living below the poverty line (MTPDP 2001-2004). Aggravating the problem is the observation that rural income distribution has worsened with nearly 50 percent of rural income being accounted for by the upper one-fifth of rural households in 1997 (MIPDP 2001-2004).\\nTo remedy the above situation, the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) for 2001- 2004 intends to promote sustainable management and use of its natural resources. To achieve this goal, the government will use four key strategies: (a) environmental sustainability; (b) broader participation of stakeholders in the management and protection of natural resources and environment; (c) equitable access to productive resources and services; and (d) technology-based production in the forestry and natural resources sectors.\\nA key component of the MTPDP is the Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM), which is the national strategy in managing the forest resources and seeks to address the interlinked problem of forest destruction and upland poverty. Based on current estimates, there are about 20 million Filipinos living in the uplands most of which had been characterized to be of low forest cover. This is based on the concept of \"people first and sustainable forestry will follow\" wherein upland communities are empowered to directly manage and benefit from the forest resources entrusted to them. The hypothesis is that when the issues of poverty and inequitable access to resources in the uplands are addressed, local community itself will join hands in protecting and managing the forest because it has an important stake on the resources.\\nThe CBFM programme has the following objectives:\\nSustainable management of forest and resources\\nSocial justice and improved well-being of the local communities\\nStrong partnership among local communities and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).\\nThe DENR is the primary government agency responsible in the sustainable development of the country\\'s natural resources and ecosystems. In implementing the CBFM programme, the DENR is guided by the following essential features:\\nSecurity of tenure in the form of long-term tenure and usufructuary instruments\\nSocial equity by giving enough access to the natural endowments of the area, and internally through equitable benefit-sharing arrangements among the members of the people\\'s organizations\\nStrong partnership between the national government agency and the local government units to ensure local support to the programme.\\nInvestment capital and market linkages to sustain the increased economic conditions of the upland community without necessarily exhausting the natural resources in the area.\\nThese very recent developments bring into focus the role of research and development institutions in the Asia-Pacific region in supplying the relevant information and research results for a clear understanding of the sustainable forest resource management-poverty reduction nexus. This is very important particularly for low forest cover but high upland population countries like the Philippines where the challenge of the natural resources governance has always been to uplift the socio-economic well-being of the upland people and at the same time maintain the health of its environment and natural resources systems.\\nFORESTRY RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES\\nAt present, state-sponsored forestry research in the Philippines is handled principally by DENR through its Ecosystem Research and Development Bureau (ERDB), and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through the research consortia being coordinated by the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD).\\nAt the same time, there are non-governmental organizations (NGO) and academe-based research institutions that conduct various researches in support of their respected mandate. One of these academe-based research institutions is the Forestry Development Center (FDC), which is based at the College of Forestry and Natural Resources (CFNR), University of the Philippines, Los Baños, College, Laguna. The FDC was established under Presidential Decree No. 1559 issued in 1978 to conduct basic policy researches in forestry and develop, or help develop, an effective machinery for forestry policy formulation and implementation. Its objectives include:\\nGeneration of information/data on forestry related areas of concern\\nConduct of basic forest policy and related researches relevant to changing national priorities, goal and objectives\\nAdvocate policy reforms, which will enhance forestry development in particular and national development in general\\nPromote healthy discussion of policy reforms and critical development issues in forestry among sectors concerned.\\nPromote the publication and dissemination of forestry policy information.\\nIt employs three main approaches, namely:\\nPolicy research and studies in the following areas: social forestry, environmental forestry and biodiversity, sustainable forest resources development.\\nForums wherein the FDC facilitates free and open discussion and experience of ideas through seminars, symposiums, conference, workshop and round-table talks for deeper analyses of environmental policies and issues for further reforms.\\nInformation dissemination through publications such as policy papers, occasional papers, seminar/ workshop proceedings, bibliographies of forestry and environmental laws/regulations.\\nIn view of the changing demands for relevant research on poverty reduction programmes and strategies anchored on the natural endowments of the country, specifically in the uplands, research thrusts of the FDC and other academe-based research institutions will now have to focus on the following:\\nImpact studies of existing forestry programmes particularly on the improvement of the socio-economic well-being of the upland farmers - There must be a conscious effort to determine whether existing development programmes in the uplands are really giving significant benefits to the poor on a sustained basis. In this regard, the FDC has conducted a series of assessments of both the bio-physical and socio-institutional components of the country\\'s Community-Based Forest Management programme based on the targets agreed upon by the upland community and the government over a given area. This kind of research will disclose the impact of the development programme both on the forest and on the upland community. The data to be generated from this kind of research will be useful as cross-reference if indeed the country is on track with its commitment to reduce the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by at least one-half by 2015.\\nPolicy advocacy to push the adoption of relevant policies at all levels geared towards harnessing forests for poverty eradication in the uplands - An indispensable prerequisite to sustain the contribution of forests to the eradication of poverty in the uplands is the presence of enabling policy system. The research institution should therefore be concerned not only in the generation and interpretation of data but also in translating research results into hard policies, then be able to advocate for the formal adoption of these policies on a broader scale. This activity requires different expertise and methodology but remains a critical phase in the overall objective of establishing an enabling policy environment to eradicate poverty in the uplands using the forest resources. In the Philippines, the College of Forestry and Natural Resources, through the FDC, is very active in undertaking forest policy advocacy work. This is done by lobbying with lawmakers for the passage of laws affecting the natural resources sector, participating in important deliberations of proposed laws and even administrative issuance and submitting policy proposals for consideration of the policy makers.\\nCapacity building of upland community - There are plenty of researchers on new technologies that would improve crop yields both in terms of volume and quality. The challenge is to bring these technologies to the doorstep of the upland farmer so that he can use them in his farm. This is one role which research institutions should give equal importance because no matter how good the technology is on paper if it is not being employed for the benefit of the upland farmers, then it has no extrinsic value at all. Trainings and information and education campaigns must therefore become integral components of the research programme of R & D institutions to ensure that the results of their researches and studies are applied at the grassroots level. The research institution in effect acts as transferor of practical technology direct to the end users.\\nCoalition formation - Since sustainable forest management and poverty are both multi-dimensional in nature, R & D institutions should endeavour to join their efforts to take advantage of their respective talents, disciplinary strengths and resources. This strategy enables more integrated research programme among research institutions having complementary interests either on poverty eradication in the uplands or sustainable forest resource management. It will also strengthen the policy advocacy work designed towards the formal adoption of policy reforms resulting from researches and studies.\\nThe FDC is currently applying this approach in promoting the formal adoption of the Philippine Strategy for Improved Watershed Resources Management (PSIWRW). By convening an annual national watershed forum, almost all water-related agencies of the government, the private sector and civil society are gathered round the table. In the process, albeit informally, a coalition could be formed composed of these water-related agencies and institutions that could be mobilized for a concerted action in the future. In similar fashion, all the major agencies and institutions concerned with poverty eradication and sustainable forest resources management could organize themselves into a coalition that will advance their common objective of eradicating poverty through the sustainable management of forest resources.\\nLaying the scientific basis for policy making - Policy-makers rely much on empirical evidence to support their policy initiatives. Oftentimes though, this relationship is missing such that research institutions continue to undertake research for the sake of research. At the other end, policy initiatives lack a solid foundation because these are not backed up by scientific data resulting in policy stalemate. Given this common situation in the Philippines and perhaps in many developing countries, academe-based research institutions could employ a proactive stance by configuring their research programmes along the country\\'s macro-development plans and national policy agenda on poverty eradication and sustainable forest resources management. The finding of these aligned researches and studies would then be immensely relevant and valuable to the policy process of the government. In essence, the research institutions act as clearing house for information processing in support of policy making.\\nFor example, although nobody will argue the need to eradicate poverty in the uplands and at the same time, sustainably manage the forest resources there, the scientific predicate that would articulate the specifics of this relationship may not yet be ready. As a result, the passage of policies that would capture the ramifications of sustainable forest resource management and poverty eradication in the uplands could not catch the imagination of the public. This is the case in the Philippines where the country\\'s main forest policy is already about 27 years old and amendments tabled remains pending for many reasons. One of which is the lack of snowballed public clamour towards approval. This lack of public support could be a function of the inability of the country\\'s research institutions to articulate with conviction the scientific foundation of the pending amendments.\\nDeconstruct conventional theories on the environment-poverty nexus - The research institutions should now look more closely at the validity of conventional theories surrounding the so-called environment-poverty nexus. For a long time, the tenet is that population growth will lead to environmental degradation because of poverty. This is unfairly blaming the upland farmers for the sorry state of the uplands. There is a need to review those conventional assumptions and come up with new ideas on how to solve the problem of poverty in the uplands. For example, in the CBFM programme that is being assessed by the FDC, one of the areas where the researchers are interested in relates to the non-forest-based employment opportunities of the upland farmers. The idea is to determine if the uplifting of at least the economic status of the upland farmers could be successfully detached from the forest resources existing in the area. If this is possible then the twin objectives of forest protection and economic growth in the upland community could be achieved through the programme.\\nProvide empirical evidence towards the design of academic programmes built on the philosophy that integrates poverty eradication and forest conservation - It is high time that poverty eradication and forest conservation is placed in the centre of academic discussion so that future practitioners will be equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and right attitude towards this human endeavour. Research institutions could immensely help influence the development of this kind of academic programmes owing to their rich database on the intimate link between poverty and natural resources and the consequent dynamics that emerge from this interaction. The advantage of academe-based research institutions is that they are organized and working within an academic community and this set-up gives them access to the planning and revision of academic programmes. Furthermore, the researchers are frequently seconded to teach or guide graduate studies and this gives these researchers adequate opportunities to convey the results of their researches to the faculty and students.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn its policy brief entitled \"How forests can reduce poverty\", the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) presented an agenda for action composed of four major components on how trees, forests and forestry can contribute towards increasing food security and reducing poverty:\\nStrengthening rights, capabilities and governance - This component requires three strategies, namely: (a) support the poor\\'s own decision-making power; (b) strengthen forest rights of the poor and the means to claim them; and (c) recognize links between forestry and local governance.\\nReducing vulnerability - This is achieved by: (a) make safely nets not poverty traps; (b) support tree planting outside forests; (c) cut the regulatory burden on the poor and make regulation affordable; and (d) reduce unfair obligations in forest management.\\nCapturing emerging opportunities - This involves four key strategies: (a) remove the barriers to market entry; (b) base land use decisions on true value of forests; (c) ensure that markets for environmental services benefit the poor; and (d) support associations and financing for local forest businesses.\\nWorking in partnership - Strategies under this component are: (a) simplify policies and support participatory processes; (b) promote multisectoral learning and action; (c) enhance interagency collaboration and (d) make NGOs and the private sector partners in poverty reduction.\\nThis four-point agenda for action presents a very good opportunity for academe-based research institutions to give a significant contribution to the global programme of poverty eradication using forest resources. Each of the strategies identified in this four-point agenda for action is a critical research area wherein academe-based institutions could innovate and seek their changed roles. As stressed in the World Development Report 2003, of the many interrelated drivers of socio-economic change and transformation, scientific and technological innovation is the first. Logically therefore, research institutions should be at the forefront in finding ways and means of combating poverty in the uplands.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\nAnonymous. 1978.

Esto se refleja en la ausencia                  de instituciones geriátricas, dedicadas al cuidado de personas mayores.\\nCultura\\nLas artes como la música formaban parte de la vida pre-hispánica            en Filipinas. Los instrumentos musicales como la flauta y la guitarra de            bambú y el gong, eran utilizados en épocas que datan del año 500. Existían            también canciones indígenas para las distintas fases de la vida - el nacimiento,            la infancia, el noviazgo, el matrimonio y la muerte. La pintura, en especial sobre el cuerpo           humano, se practicaba también. Las primeras personas encontradas por Magallanes y su            tripulación eran indígenas con tatuajes que llamaron \"pintados\".\\nLos primeros exploradores y cronistas españoles se sorprendieron cuando se enteraron que           la escritura ya estaba desarrollada en muchas partes del archipiélago y que muchos indígenas            eran alfabetos. Las primeras escrituras estaban probablemente hechas en materiales perecederos            tales como las hojas y las cortezas de los árboles así que los investigadores y los antropólogos            no pudieron determinar con exactitud cuando fueron realizadas las primeras escrituras en el país.           Creen que podría haber sido desarrollada entre 200 años AC y 1.200 DC, inicialmente para anotar            transacciones comerciales y posteriormente para apuntar canciones, cuentos populares,            poesía y otras formas de la literatura.\\nDiversidad de culturas en el país\\nLa existencia de un variado número de diferentes idiomas, dialectos y de tradiciones religiosas ha hecho que los filipinos no hayan desarrollado una única cultura nacional. Durante muchos siglos, la evolución de la historia cultural de Filipinas ha tenido una naturaleza local, enriquecida con influencias de China, Malaysia, España y Estados Unidos. Los elementos populares indígenas encontraron expresión en la literatura y en la música, así como en otras formas culturales. Entre los deportes tradicionales se encuentran el arnis, un tipo de esgrima con palos de madera, y el sipa, un juego muy parecido al voleibol, excepto en que los jugadores usan tanto los pies como sus manos y brazos. Las peleas de gallos y el boxeo son muy populares y la influencia cultural estadounidense se aprecia en la popularidad del béisbol y del baloncesto.\\nUna de las características más notables de la sociedad filipina es la tradición de una fuerte fidelidad familiar. Esto se refleja en la ausencia de instituciones geriátricas, dedicadas a acoger a las personas mayores, y de orfanatos. Desde la época precolonial, las mujeres filipinas tenían elevadas posiciones en la sociedad y, en la actualidad, continúan desempeñando importantes cargos en la vida económica, social y política.\\nAdemás de las bibliotecas universitarias, las principales bibliotecas del país son la Biblioteca de la Ciudad de Manila, la Biblioteca Nacional y la biblioteca del Instituto de la Ciencia y de Información Tecnológica, todas en Manila. El Museo y la Biblioteca Memorial López, en Pasay, tienen colecciones de pinturas de los principales artistas filipinos, así como las cartas y manuscritos del escritor y patriota José Rizal.\\nEl Museo de Santo Tomás, en Manila, tiene las colecciones arqueológicas y de historia natural más destacadas, que ilustran la historia de las islas. El Museo Nacional, en Manila, tiene divisiones de antropología, botánica, geología y zoología, junto a colecciones de arte y un planetario.\\nLa literatura filipina anterior a la llegada de los españoles consistía en historias populares de transmisión oral y proverbios que circulaban en los diversos dialectos de las islas. La literatura bajo la influencia española fue en un principio poética y religiosa y se desarrolló posteriormente bajo la influencia estadounidense hacia la narrativa y el teatro. Entre los escritores de Filipinas se encuentran el novelista José Rizal, Francisco Balagtas, poeta y filósofo, José García Villa, poeta y uno de los escritores más destacados en narrativa corta, Carlos P. Rómulo, periodista y diplomático, el poeta y dramaturgo Claro Recto, el poeta, novelista y dramaturgo Nick Joaquín, y Pas Marques Benitz, un escritor de narrativa corta.\\nEl kundiman, una combinación de palabras y música, es único en las islas. Entre los músicos de fama de Filipinas destacan Rodolfo Cornejo, compositor y director musical, Antonino Buenaventura, director musical, y Antonio J. Molina, director musical y compositor. Los bailes populares son también destacados y hay muchos bailes ceremoniales y tradicionales para diferentes ocasiones.\\nLas artes y la música\\nLos filipinos estuvieron expuestos a las artes y la música europea con la introducción del violín,            el piano, el arpa, la guitarra y otros instrumentos. El órgano de bambú en Las Piñas,            construido en 1.818, forma parte del legado de la música filipina durante la época colonial.           Los bailes populares mexicanos como la polca, la jota y el rigodón influyeron en la danza           nativa filipina.\\nCalendario gregoriano\\nFueron los españoles que sincronizaron el calendario filipino con el resto del mundo a través de            la introducción del calendario gregoriano en 1844.\\n', 16]\n",

Each barkada is either all male or all female. Members develop their own slang and go almost everywhere together.\\nThe country's most popular sport is basketball; in 1954, the country was placed third in the World Basketball Championship. Men and boys play the game in school gyms and neighbourhood streets. Filipino players have excelled at the sport and become the top players in Asia. Crowds flock to watch professional teams compete in the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Filipinos have also excelled at boxing, with athletes winning international competitions. Flyweight boxer Mansuetto Onyok Velasco took a silver medal at the 1996 Olympics.\\nA common form of handball, jai alai, has recently declined in popularity and been banned at the professional level due to gambling. In the game, players bounce a hard rubber ball off one end of a court and catch the ball in a small basket (cesta) tied to their hand. Sipa, popular with adults and children, is a type of volleyball that uses a rattan ball; players must drive the ball over a net using only their legs, body and feet. In the martial art of arnis de mano, invented by a Filipino, competitors fight with rattan sticks. People also enjoy bowling.\\nFilipinos enthusiastic about games such mahjongg, a Chinese game played with 144 tiles. Chess, checkers, dama (a type of draughts) and dominos are also very popular and often played on street corners. In 1992, the Philippines hosted the World Chess Olympics; the country has many top players, including grandmasters Eugenio Torre and Rosendo Balinas Jr. The most popular form of entertainment among men, however, is cockfighting. Virtually every town has a cockpit, which is jammed on weekends and holidays with spectators betting on the fights.\\nGiven the country's many beaches, Sunday beach picnics are a popular pastime for families. Wealthier Filipinos and tourists also enjoy yachting, diving and sailing.\\n\\xa0\\xa0Did you know?\\nKali, a martial art indigenous to the Philippines, was originally developed for defense and partly based on skill with a wavy-edged sword. According to legend, when Ferdinand Magellan, the first Spanish visitor, arrived in 1524, he was opposed by islanders using kali swords and killed by their leader, Lapu Lapu-now considered a folk hero. Modern kali practitioners use weapons such as sticks and knives.\\n\", 28]\n",

      "[0.0006315226517789029, 'Source: Philippine Statistics Authority [3]\\nEthnologue lists 186 individual languages in the Philippines, 182 of which are living languages, while 4 no longer have any known speakers. Most native languages are part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages , which is itself a branch of the Austronesian language family . [410] The only language not classified as an Austronesian language is Chavacano which is a creole language of Mexican-Spanish and is classified as a Romance language . [425]\\nFilipino and English are the official languages of the country. [12] Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog , spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English are used in government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides for the promotion of Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. [12] Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. [426] However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages. [427]\\nNineteen regional languages act as auxiliary official languages used as mediums of instruction: Aklanon , Bikol , Cebuano , Chavacano , Hiligaynon , Ibanag , Ilocano , Ivatan , Kapampangan , Kinaray-a , Maguindanao , Maranao , Pangasinan , Sambal , Surigaonon , Tagalog, Tausug , Waray , and Yakan . [2] Other indigenous languages such as, Cuyonon , Ifugao , Itbayat , Kalinga , Kamayo , Kankanaey , Masbateño , Romblomanon , Malay , and several Visayan languages are prevalent in their respective provinces. [428]\\nLanguages not indigenous to the islands are also taught in select schools. Mandarin is used in Chinese schools catering to the Chinese Filipino community. Islamic schools in Mindanao teach Modern Standard Arabic in their curriculum. [429] French , German , Japanese , Korean , and Spanish are taught with the help of foreign linguistic institutions. [430] The Department of Education began teaching the Malay languages of Indonesian and Malaysian in 2013. [431]\\nReligion\\nMain article: Religion in the Philippines\\nLoay Church\\nThe Philippines is an officially secular state , although Christianity is the dominant faith. [432] Census data from 2010 found that about 80.58% of the population professed Catholicism . [4] Around 37% regularly attend Mass and 29% identify as very religious. [433] [434] Protestants are 10.8% [435] [436] of the total population, mostly endorsing Evangelical Protestant denominations that were introduced by American missionaries at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, they are heavily concentrated in Northern Luzon and Southern Mindanao. [437] [438] The Philippine Independent Church is a notable independent Catholic denomination. [439] [440] [441] Iglesia ni Cristo is a notable Restorationist denomination in the country. [442] [443]\\nIslam is the second largest religion. The Muslim population of the Philippines was reported as 5.57% of the total population according to census returns in 2010, [4] although a 2012 report by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos estimates it at 11%. [444] The majority of Muslims live in the Bangsamoro region . [445] [446] [447] [448] Most practice Sunni Islam under the Shafi\\'i school . [449] [450]\\nAn unknown number of Filipinos are irreligious , but they may form as much as 10% of the population. [451] [452] Catholicism\\'s historic dominance is steadily declining, with about 9% of adherents considering leaving their church. [453]\\nAn estimated 2% of the total population practice Philippine traditional religions , whose practices and folk beliefs are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam. [443] [454] Buddhism is practiced by around 2% of the population, and is concentrated among Filipinos of Chinese descent. [443] [449] [454] The remaining population is divided between a number of religious groups, including Hindus , Jews , and Baha\\'is . [455]\\nHealth\\nThe façade of the Bonifacio Global City branch of St. Luke\\'s Medical Center\\nThere are an increasing number of private health providers and, as of 2009 [update] , 67.1% of healthcare came from private expenditures while 32.9% was from government. In 2013, total expenditures on the health sector was 3.8% of GDP, below the WHO target of 5%. [456] Health expenditure represented about 6.1% of total government spending. Per capita total expenditure at average exchange rate was USD52. [457] The budget allocation for Healthcare in 2010 was ₱28\\xa0billion (about USD597\\xa0million) or ₱310 ($7) per person [458] but had an increase in budget in 2014 with a record high in the collection of taxes from the House Bill 5727 (commonly known as Sin tax Bill). [459]\\nThere are an estimated 90,370 physicians or 1 per every 833 people, 480,910 nurses, 43,220 dentists, and 1 hospital bed per every 769 people. [457] Retention of skilled practitioners is a problem. 70% of nursing graduates go overseas to work. The Philippines is the biggest supplier of nurses for export. [460]\\nIn 2001 there were about 1,700 hospitals , of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private. Cardiovascular diseases account for more than 25% of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite the increase of HIV/AIDS cases from 12,000 in 2005 [461] to 17,450 as of April 2014 with 5,965 people who were under anti-retroviral therapy, [462] the country is still a low-HIV-prevalence country with less than 0.1% of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive. [463]\\nEducation\\nMain article: Education in the Philippines\\nThe University of Santo Tomas , established in 1611, has the oldest extant university charter in Asia.\\nThe Philippines has a simple literacy rate of 95.6%, with 95.1% for males and 96.1% for females. The Philippines had a functional literacy rate of 86.45%, with 84.2% for males and 88.7% for females in 2008. [464] [465] Spending on education accounted for 16.11% in the national budget proposed for 2015. [466] [467]\\nThe Commission on Higher Education (CHED) lists 2,180 higher education institutions, 607 of which are public and 1,573 private. [468] Classes start in June and end in March. The majority of colleges and universities follow a semester calendar from June to October and November to March. There are a number of foreign schools with study programs. [218] A 6-year elementary and 4-year high school education is mandatory [469] with an additional two years being added in 2013. [470] [471]\\nSeveral government agencies are involved with education. The Department of Education covers elementary, secondary, and non-formal education. The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) administers post-secondary, middle-level education training and development. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) supervises college and graduate academic programs and degrees as well as regulates standards in higher education. [472]\\nIn 2004, madaris were mainstreamed in 16 regions nationwide, mainly in Muslim areas in Mindanao under the auspices and program of the Department of Education. [473] Public universities are all non-sectarian entities, and are further classified as State Universities and Colleges (SUC) or Local Colleges and Universities (LCU). [468] The University of the Philippines , a system of eight (8) constituent universities, is the national university system of the Philippines. [474]\\nCulture\\nA participant of the Ati-Atihan Festival .\\nPhilippine culture is a combination of Eastern and Western cultures . The Philippines exhibits aspects found in other Asian countries with a Malay [475] heritage, yet its culture also displays a significant number of Spanish and American influences. Traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas (district festivals) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common, these community celebrations are times for feasting, music, and dancing. The Ati-Atihan , Moriones and Sinulog festivals are a couple of the most well-known.\\nSome traditions, however, are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization. The Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the Philippines. They are famed for their iconic performances of Philippine dances such as the tinikling and singkil that both feature clashing bamboo poles. [476]\\nOne of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua , which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population. [477] The names of many streets, towns, and provinces are also in Spanish.\\nThe common use of the English language is an example of the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends. This affinity is seen in Filipinos\\' love of fast food and American film and music. Fast food outlets are found on many street corners. American global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market, but local fast food chains like Goldilocks and most notably Jollibee , the leading fast food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals. [478] [479]\\nArchitecture\\nMain article: Architecture of the Philippines\\nColonial houses in Vigan .\\nSpanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor, but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II. [58] Some examples remain, mainly among the country\\'s churches, government buildings, and universities. Four Philippine baroque churches are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the San Agustín Church in Manila, Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte , Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (Santa María) Church in Ilocos Sur , and Santo Tomás de Villanueva Church in Iloilo . [480] Vigan in Ilocos Sur is also known for the many Hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there. [481]\\nThe American occupation in 1898 introduced a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila . Part of the Burnham\\'s plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture . [482] In Iloilo , a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American occupation in the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real . [483]\\nHowever, certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate. Limestones and coral were used as building materials. [484] Idjangs or Ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the Spanish conquest of the whole Philippines. [485]\\nMusic\\nMain articles: Music of the Philippines and Original Pilipino Music\\nPercussion instruments that make up the Philippine kulintang ensemble, an example of pre-Hispanic musical tradition\\nPhilippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. Some examples of this tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T\\'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao . This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang .\\nDuring the Spanish era Rondalya music, where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals. [486]\\nMarcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) were some of the recognized musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. [487] [488] However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers . [489]\\nDance\\nTinikling dancers.\\nJust like the evolution of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga .\\nUniversal dances in the Philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals, mimicry, life cycle and parties. During the Spanish era, most dances are accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well.\\nOne famous dance that is well known is called the Tinikling , where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles. It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about \"How rural townsfolk mingle\". The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides. The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the Singkil . [490] Nowadays, in the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few. [491]\\nVisual art\\nThe Spoliarium (1884) by Juan Luna .\\nPottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5\\xa0BC to 225\\xa0AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods. [492] [493]\\nEarly Philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu . The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration.

[495]\\nValues\\nFurther information: Filipino values\\nAs a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity ), and commercial relationships. [496]\\nFilipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. [497] The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of \"Hiya\", roughly translated as \\'a sense of shame\\', and \"Amor propio\" or \\'self-esteem\\'. [497] Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos. [498]\\nOther elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery. [499]\\nCuisine\\nLeft-to-right: Lumpia , Adobo , Halo-halo and Sisig .\\nFilipino cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic , Chinese , American , and other Asian influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas. [479] [500]\\nPopular dishes include lechón , adobo , sinigang , kare-kare , tapa , crispy pata , pancit , lumpia , and halo-halo . Some common local ingredients used in cooking are calamansi , coconuts, saba (a kind of short wide plantain ), mangoes , ube , milkfish , and fish sauce . Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors. [479] [500]\\nUnlike many of their Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork. [501]\\nThe traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan (using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth) [502] was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas. [503] However, due to the various Filipino restaurants that introduced Filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to Filipino urbanites, kamayan fast became popular. This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the \"Boodle Fight\" concept (as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army), wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and Filipino viands are placed all together for a filial, friendly and/or communal kamayan feasting. [504]\\nLiterature\\nJosé Rizal is a pioneer of Philippine Revolution through his literary works.\\nPhilippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people. While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the aswang , the manananggal , the diwata / engkanto , and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling , Lam-Ang , and the Sarimanok . [505]\\nPhilippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English. Some of the most known were created from the 17th to 19th\\xa0century. Adarna , for example, is a famous epic about an eponymous magical bird allegedly written by José de la Cruz or \"Huseng Sisiw\". [506] Francisco Balagtas , the poet and playwright who wrote Florante at Laura , is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language. José Rizal wrote the novels Noli Me Tángere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The Filibustering, also known as The Reign of Greed). He is considered a national hero. [507] His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule, and his death by firing squad, inspired other Filipino revolutionaries to seek independence.

Critically acclaimed directors and actors include Lino Brocka and Nora Aunor for films like Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag (Manila: In the Claws of Light) and Himala (Miracle). [511] [512] [513] [514] In recent years it has become common to see celebrities flitting between television and movies and then moving into politics provoking concerns. [515]\\nCinema\\nMain article: Cinema of the Philippines\\nBrillante Mendoza is a prominent Filipino film director.\\nSalón de Pertierra was the first introduced moving picture on January 1, 1897 in the Philippines. All films were all in Spanish since Philippine cinema was first introduced during the final years of the Spanish era of the country. Antonio Ramos was the first known movie producer. He used the Lumiere Cinematograph when he filmed Panorama de Manila (Manila landscape), Fiesta de Quiapo (Quiapo Fiesta), Puente de España (Bridge of Spain), and Escenas Callejeras (Street scenes). Meanwhile, Jose Nepomuceno was dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\". [516] Dubbed as the \"Father of Philippine Cinema\", his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines. [517] His first film produced was entitled Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden) in 1919.\\nFilm showing resumed in 1900 during the American period . Walgrah, a British entrepreneur, opened the Cine Walgrah at No. 60 Calle Santa Rosa in Intramuros . It was also during this time that a movie market was formally created in the country along with the arrival of silent movies. These silent films were always accompanied by gramophone, a piano, a quartet, or a 200-man choir. During the Japanese occupation , filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of Philippine cinema with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures.\\nDuring the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft porn) pictures and an era of musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. [518] The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry. [519] In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.

      "[0.0006315226517789029, 'Source: Philippine Statistics Authority [3]\\nEthnologue lists 186 individual languages in the Philippines, 182 of which are living languages, while 4 no longer have any known speakers. Most native languages are part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages , which is itself a branch of the Austronesian language family . [410] The only language not classified as an Austronesian language is Chavacano which is a creole language of Mexican-Spanish and is classified as a Romance language . [425]\\nFilipino and English are the official languages of the country. [12] Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog , spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions. Both Filipino and English are used in government, education, print, broadcast media, and business. In most towns, the local indigenous language is spoken. The Philippine constitution provides for the promotion of Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. [12] Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but is experiencing revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. [426] However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages. [427]\\nNineteen regional languages act as auxiliary official languages used as mediums of instruction: Aklanon , Bikol , Cebuano , Chavacano , Hiligaynon , Ibanag , Ilocano , Ivatan , Kapampangan , Kinaray-a , Maguindanao , Maranao , Pangasinan , Sambal , Surigaonon , Tagalog, Tausug , Waray , and Yakan . [2] Other indigenous languages such as, Cuyonon , Ifugao , Itbayat , Kalinga , Kamayo , Kankanaey , Masbateño , Romblomanon , Malay , and several Visayan languages are prevalent in their respective provinces. [428]\\nLanguages not indigenous to the islands are also taught in select schools. Mandarin is used in Chinese schools catering to the Chinese Filipino community. Islamic schools in Mindanao teach Modern Standard Arabic in their curriculum. [429] French , German , Japanese , Korean , and Spanish are taught with the help of foreign linguistic institutions. [430] The Department of Education began teaching the Malay languages of Indonesian and Malaysian in 2013. [431]\\nReligion\\nMain article: Religion in the Philippines\\nLoay Church\\nThe Philippines is an officially secular state , although Christianity is the dominant faith. [432] Census data from 2010 found that about 80.58% of the population professed Catholicism . [4] Around 37% regularly attend Mass and 29% identify as very religious. [433] [434] Protestants are 10.8% [435] [436] of the total population, mostly endorsing Evangelical Protestant denominations that were introduced by American missionaries at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, they are heavily concentrated in Northern Luzon and Southern Mindanao. [437] [438] The Philippine Independent Church is a notable independent Catholic denomination. [439] [440] [441] Iglesia ni Cristo is a notable Restorationist denomination in the country. [442] [443]\\nIslam is the second largest religion. The Muslim population of the Philippines was reported as 5.57% of the total population according to census returns in 2010, [4] although a 2012 report by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos estimates it at 11%. [444] The majority of Muslims live in the Bangsamoro region . [445] [446] [447] [448] Most practice Sunni Islam under the Shafi\\'i school . [449] [450]\\nAn unknown number of Filipinos are irreligious , but they may form as much as 10% of the population. [451] [452] Catholicism\\'s historic dominance is steadily declining, with about 9% of adherents considering leaving their church. [453]\\nAn estimated 2% of the total population practice Philippine traditional religions , whose practices and folk beliefs are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam. [443] [454] Buddhism is practiced by around 2% of the population, and is concentrated among Filipinos of Chinese descent. [443] [449] [454] The remaining population is divided between a number of religious groups, including Hindus , Jews , and Baha\\'is . [455]\\nHealth\\nThe façade of the Bonifacio Global City branch of St. Luke\\'s Medical Center\\nThere are an increasing number of private health providers and, as of 2009 [update] , 67.1% of healthcare came from private expenditures while 32.9% was from government. In 2013, total expenditures on the health sector was 3.8% of GDP, below the WHO target of 5%. [456] Health expenditure represented about 6.1% of total government spending. Per capita total expenditure at average exchange rate was USD52. [457] The budget allocation for Healthcare in 2010 was ₱28\\xa0billion (about USD597\\xa0million) or ₱310 ($7) per person [458] but had an increase in budget in 2014 with a record high in the collection of taxes from the House Bill 5727 (commonly known as Sin tax Bill). [459]\\nThere are an estimated 90,370 physicians or 1 per every 833 people, 480,910 nurses, 43,220 dentists, and 1 hospital bed per every 769 people. [457] Retention of skilled practitioners is a problem. 70% of nursing graduates go overseas to work. The Philippines is the biggest supplier of nurses for export. [460]\\nIn 2001 there were about 1,700 hospitals , of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private. Cardiovascular diseases account for more than 25% of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite the increase of HIV/AIDS cases from 12,000 in 2005 [461] to 17,450 as of April 2014 with 5,965 people who were under anti-retroviral therapy, [462] the country is still a low-HIV-prevalence country with less than 0.1% of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive. [463]\\nEducation\\nMain article: Education in the Philippines\\nThe University of Santo Tomas , established in 1611, has the oldest extant university charter in Asia.\\nThe Philippines has a simple literacy rate of 95.6%, with 95.1% for males and 96.1% for females. The Philippines had a functional literacy rate of 86.45%, with 84.2% for males and 88.7% for females in 2008. [464] [465] Spending on education accounted for 16.11% in the national budget proposed for 2015. [466] [467]\\nThe Commission on Higher Education (CHED) lists 2,180 higher education institutions, 607 of which are public and 1,573 private. [468] Classes start in June and end in March. The majority of colleges and universities follow a semester calendar from June to October and November to March. There are a number of foreign schools with study programs. [218] A 6-year elementary and 4-year high school education is mandatory [469] with an additional two years being added in 2013. [470] [471]\\nSeveral government agencies are involved with education. The Department of Education covers elementary, secondary, and non-formal education. The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) administers post-secondary, middle-level education training and development. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) supervises college and graduate academic programs and degrees as well as regulates standards in higher education. [472]\\nIn 2004, madaris were mainstreamed in 16 regions nationwide, mainly in Muslim areas in Mindanao under the auspices and program of the Department of Education. [473] Public universities are all non-sectarian entities, and are further classified as State Universities and Colleges (SUC) or Local Colleges and Universities (LCU). [468] The University of the Philippines , a system of eight (8) constituent universities, is the national university system of the Philippines. [474]\\nCulture\\nA participant of the Ati-Atihan Festival .\\nPhilippine culture is a combination of Eastern and Western cultures . The Philippines exhibits aspects found in other Asian countries with a Malay [475] heritage, yet its culture also displays a significant number of Spanish and American influences. Traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas (district festivals) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common, these community celebrations are times for feasting, music, and dancing. The Ati-Atihan , Moriones and Sinulog festivals are a couple of the most well-known.\\nSome traditions, however, are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization. The Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the Philippines. They are famed for their iconic performances of Philippine dances such as the tinikling and singkil that both feature clashing bamboo poles. [476]\\nOne of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua , which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population. [477] The names of many streets, towns, and provinces are also in Spanish.\\nThe common use of the English language is an example of the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends. This affinity is seen in Filipinos\\' love of fast food and American film and music. Fast food outlets are found on many street corners. American global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market, but local fast food chains like Goldilocks and most notably Jollibee , the leading fast food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals. [478] [479]\\nArchitecture\\nMain article: Architecture of the Philippines\\nColonial houses in Vigan .\\nSpanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor, but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II. [58] Some examples remain, mainly among the country\\'s churches, government buildings, and universities. Four Philippine baroque churches are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the San Agustín Church in Manila, Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte , Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (Santa María) Church in Ilocos Sur , and Santo Tomás de Villanueva Church in Iloilo . [480] Vigan in Ilocos Sur is also known for the many Hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there. [481]\\nThe American occupation in 1898 introduced a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila . Part of the Burnham\\'s plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture . [482] In Iloilo , a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American occupation in the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real . [483]\\nHowever, certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate. Limestones and coral were used as building materials. [484] Idjangs or Ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the Spanish conquest of the whole Philippines. [485]\\nMusic\\nMain articles: Music of the Philippines and Original Pilipino Music\\nPercussion instruments that make up the Philippine kulintang ensemble, an example of pre-Hispanic musical tradition\\nPhilippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. Some examples of this tribal music is Koyu No Tebulul of the T\\'boli and Ambo Hato of the Ifugao . This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the Kulintang .\\nDuring the Spanish era Rondalya music, where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals. [486]\\nMarcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) were some of the recognized musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. [487] [488] However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers . [489]\\nDance\\nTinikling dancers.\\nJust like the evolution of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was minimal in the region of Zamboanga .\\nUniversal dances in the Philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals, mimicry, life cycle and parties. During the Spanish era, most dances are accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well.\\nOne famous dance that is well known is called the Tinikling , where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles. It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about \"How rural townsfolk mingle\". The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides. The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the Singkil . [490] Nowadays, in the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few. [491]\\nVisual art\\nThe Spoliarium (1884) by Juan Luna .\\nPottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5\\xa0BC to 225\\xa0AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods. [492] [493]\\nEarly Philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu . The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos\\' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery. [494]\\nPaintings of early modernist painters such as Damián Domingo often still had a religious association but the art of Juan Luna and Félix Hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist Fernando Amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as Fernando Zóbel used both realistic and abstract techniques.\\nIn the modern period, the integration of architecture in the Art Deco style happened. Many of these examples can be seen in statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces. [495]\\nValues\\nFurther information: Filipino values\\nAs a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity ), and commercial relationships. [496]\\nFilipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. [497] The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of \"Hiya\", roughly translated as \\'a sense of shame\\', and \"Amor propio\" or \\'self-esteem\\'.

These silent films were always accompanied by gramophone, a piano, a quartet, or a 200-man choir. During the Japanese occupation , filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of Philippine cinema with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures.\\nDuring the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft porn) pictures and an era of musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. [518] The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry. [519] In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.

      "[0.0006313009263686297, '2 million reasons for withdrawing 51 troops\\nRene P. Ciria-Cruz, Pacific News Service\\nPublished 4:00\\xa0am, Monday, July 26, 2004\\nAn old man talking to himself again\\nAmerican officials, several of their allies and many U.S. media criticized Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo \\'s decision to recall her nation\\'s small military contingent in Iraq in order to save the life of Filipino hostage Angelo dela Cruz . They called the move cowardly and said it sent terrorists \"the wrong signal.\"\\nFor most of dela Cruz\\'s compatriots, however, and from the standpoint of their national interest, it was a sensible, even courageous move. There was more at stake in Arroyo\\'s decision to pull out of Iraq than saving the life of an unfortunate hostage or avoiding the ire of the U.S. government, a key source of foreign aid for the Philippines. The hostage crisis imperiled a crucial survival mechanism for the impoverished nation -- the gainful employment of millions of overseas Filipino workers in the Middle East. Some 2 million Filipinos work in the region, with nearly a million in Saudi Arabia alone, according to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs .\\nThese large contingents of Filipino workers have become a critical prop of the Philippine economy. They represent the millions who can\\'t find work in their own country. They send home some $8 billion a year (remittances were largely responsible for a 4.5 percent GNP growth in 2002), providing otherwise income-strapped families the spending power that keeps the economy afloat. A number of Filipinos have been among the unintended victims of suicide bombings in Israel, and a number were killed in recent attacks on foreigners working for American firms in Saudi Arabia.\\nFor Arroyo to insist on remaining in the so-called \"coalition of the willing,\" despite the terrorists\\' threats, would have exposed all Filipinos in the region to a dramatically higher level of danger -- where they are transformed into deliberate targets of terror because their government persists in giving political cover to Bush\\'s \"coalition\" by keeping a symbolic military contingent in Iraq.\\nIn such an eventuality, the mass return of millions of Filipino workers evading terrorist attacks in the Middle East would mean disaster for the Philippine economy. The Philippine government is simply not prepared to absorb a sudden influx of jobless returnees. The large-scale repatriation of Filipinos from the Middle East also would mean trouble for many Arab countries -- including some of America\\'s allies -- that have come to depend on imported Filipino labor or expertise for a multitude of tasks, from domestic work to construction and management. There can be no doubt that President Arroyo\\'s decision to pull out of Iraq to protect other Filipinos was quietly encouraged by many an Arab host government.\\nClearly, Arroyo\\'s decision was also politically self-serving, given the popular outcry for dela Cruz\\'s safe return. Overseas Filipino workers -- an estimated 8 million labor in 150 countries -- risk their lives and endure long absences from their families. They\\'re often called modern-day heroes by Filipino officials and media alike. In 1995, President Fidel Ramos \\' popularity plunged when he failed to save the life of Flor Contemplacion, a domestic worker who was hanged by the government of Singapore on a questionable murder conviction. Dela Cruz\\'s kidnapping brought back memories of that execution, and the political danger was not lost on Arroyo. She had just assumed office after a bitter election whose credibility is held in doubt. Failure to bring back dela Cruz alive would have given her enemies effective ammunition in a poisonous political climate rife with talk of destabilization plots.\\nFor most Filipino opinion-makers -- and from the standpoint of the Philippines\\' national interest -- pulling out of Iraq was not a \"wrong signal\" to terrorists. The wrong signal was to send a troop contingent to begin with, which only served to militarize the longstanding and purely civilian Filipino presence in the Middle East and made it a likely target of terrorist attacks.\\nAs for Washington\\'s implied threat of leaving the Philippines at the mercy of its homegrown terrorists, it\\'s empty and face-saving. The Philippines remains the most important staging area for U.S. operations against al Qaeda\\'s affiliates in Southeast Asia, as predominantly Muslim Indonesia and Malaysia are less than ideal hosts. In fact, several U.S. military exercises are set to take place in Southern Philippines. Like it or not, Washington is stuck with Manila, and Manila knows it.\\nLatest from the SFGATE homepage:\\nClick below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

A la izquierda, un general del Rajanato de Butuan y a la derecha, una princesa del Reino de Tondo.\\nHasta hace poco, se pensaba que los restos humanos más antiguos hallados en el archipiélago filipino correspondían al hombre de Tabon —con una antigüedad de 22\\xa0000 a 24\\xa0000 años—, [32] \\u200b [33] \\u200b pero fueron reemplazados por el metatarso del hombre de Callao , que según el método del uranio – torio tiene 67\\xa0000 años de antigüedad. [34] \\u200b Existen varias teorías sobre los orígenes de los primeros habitantes de las islas. Landa Jocano sugiere que los antepasados de los filipinos actuales surgieron y se desarrollaron localmente. Por su parte, la teoría del origen isleño de Wilhelm Solheim postula que el poblamiento del archipiélago se dio a través de las rutas de comercio que provenían de la zona de Sonda alrededor de los años 48\\xa0000 a 5000 a.\\xa0C., en vez de una migración a gran escala. [35] \\u200b La teoría de la expansión austronesia afirma que varios grupos malayo-polinesios procedentes de la isla de Taiwán comenzaron a migrar a Filipinas alrededor del 4000 a.\\xa0C., desplazando a los primeros pobladores. [36] \\u200b [37] \\u200b Los negritos estuvieron entre los primeros habitantes de las islas, pero la fecha de su aparición aún se desconoce. [17] \\u200b Para el año 1000 a.\\xa0C., los habitantes del archipiélago se habían organizado en cuatro tipos de grupos sociales: las tribus de cazadores-recolectores , sociedades guerreras, plutocracias pequeñas y principados con centro en los puertos marítimos. [38] \\u200b\\nEn el transcurso de los siguientes siglos, el comercio con los pueblos marítimos y otros países asiáticos trajo consigo la influencia del islam , el budismo y el hinduismo . Durante este tiempo no hubo ningún Estado político unificador que abarcara todo el archipiélago filipino. En su lugar, las islas estaban divididas entre varias talasocracias que a menudo luchaban entre sí, gobernadas por varios datus , rajás o sultanes . Entre ellos estaban los reinos de Manila , Namayan y Tondo , los rajanatos de Butuan y Cebú y los sultanatos de Maguindanao y Sulú . [18] \\u200b [39] \\u200b [40] \\u200b [41] \\u200b Algunas de estas sociedades fueron parte de los imperios malayos de Srivijaya , Madjapahit y Brunéi . [42] \\u200b [43] \\u200b El islam llegó a Filipinas por medio de comerciantes y algunos proselitistas provenientes de Malasia e Indonesia. [19] \\u200b De este modo, en el siglo XV el Islam se estableció en el archipiélago Sulú, y se tiene constancia de que en 1656 ya había alcanzado Mindanao , Luzón y las Bisayas . [44] \\u200b\\nArtículo principal: Capitanía General de las Filipinas\\nFuerte de Santiago en Manila, construido para defender la ciudad de los ataques externos.\\nEn 1521, el explorador portugués Fernando de Magallanes llegó a Filipinas y tomó posesión de las islas para España . [20] \\u200b La colonización comenzó en 1565, cuando el explorador español Miguel López de Legazpi llegó desde la Nueva España y fundó el primer asentamiento español en la actual Cebú . En 1571, después de tratar con las familias reales nativas durante la conspiración de Tondo y tras derrotar a la tripulación del pirata chino Limahong , los españoles establecieron en Manila la capital de Filipinas y de las Indias Orientales Españolas . [45] \\u200b [21] \\u200b\\nEl dominio español significó la unidad política del archipiélago por primera vez en su historia. Desde 1565 hasta 1821 la Capitanía General de las Filipinas dependió del Virreinato de la Nueva España con sede en la ciudad de México y después de la Guerra de Independencia de México , se administró directamente desde Madrid. Desde esta misma Capitanía, España controlaba otros de sus territorios en el Pacífico , entre ellos Guam , Palaos , las Islas Carolinas y las Islas Marianas . [46] \\u200b Entre los siglos XVI y XIX, el galeón de Manila comunicó la capital de Filipinas con Acapulco , realizando un viaje o dos al año en ambas direcciones. El comercio transpacífico introdujo en el archipiélago alimentos como el maíz , el tomate , la patata , el chile y la piña , todos procedentes de América . [21] \\u200b Los misioneros católicos convirtieron a la mayoría de los habitantes al cristianismo y fundaron escuelas, universidades y hospitales. Los españoles también llevaron a Filipinas el arado , la imprenta , el reloj y la construcción en piedra. Un decreto español de 1863 estableció la educación pública gratuita en el país por primera vez, lo que dio lugar a altos índices de alfabetización. [47] \\u200b\\nMoneda de un cuarto de 1829, emitida en Manila. Muestra el escudo de España.\\nDurante el periodo de gobierno español, las fuerzas hispano-indígenas lucharon contra varias rebeliones internas y múltiples ataques externos, de piratas chinos, de holandeses y portugueses: son especialmente destacables los Combates de Cagayán (1582), que enfrentaron a los famosos Tercios españoles contra piratas y samuráis japoneses. En una extensión de los combates de la Guerra de los Siete Años , fuerzas británicas ocuparon brevemente la ciudad de Manila. Las fuerzas inglesas encontraron aliados como Diego y Gabriela Silang , que aprovecharon la oportunidad para liderar una revuelta, hasta que el gobierno español finalmente fue restaurado tras el Tratado de París de 1763 . [19] \\u200b [48] \\u200b [49] \\u200b Durante la ocupación británica, los invasores aprovecharon para sustraer valiosas cartas de navegación del Pacífico de los archivos de Manila. Esas cartas, el resultado de siglos de exploración española, acabaron en manos de navegantes ingleses como James Cook, que utilizaron más tarde en sus propias expediciones.\\nJosé Rizal , Marcelo del Pilar y Mariano Ponce , líderes del Movimiento de Propaganda.\\nEn el siglo XIX, los puertos filipinos se abrieron al comercio mundial y se produjeron cambios en la sociedad filipina. A principio de siglo comenzó a sentirse la influencia de los movimientos independentistas sudamericanos. El 1 de febrero de 1818 arribó Hipólito Bouchard , corsario de las Provincias Unidas de Sudamérica , a bordo de la fragata La Argentina . Durante dos meses mantuvo bloqueada la bahía de Manila, cerrando además el estrecho de San Bernandino [50] \\u200b. En este período muchos españoles nacidos en Filipinas ( criollos ) y los de ascendencia mixta ( mestizos ) se hicieron ricos. La afluencia de colonos españoles y latinoamericanos disminuyó el poder de la Iglesia y abrió algunos puestos en el gobierno tradicionalmente ocupados por los españoles nacidos en la península Ibérica ( peninsulares ). Los ideales de la revolución también comenzaron a extenderse a través de las islas. La insatisfacción de los criollos resultó en la revuelta de Cavite El Viejo en 1872 , una de las precursoras de la Revolución filipina . [19] \\u200b [51] \\u200b [52] \\u200b [53] \\u200b [54] \\u200b\\nRevolución filipina, Primera República Filipina y dominio estadounidense[ editar ]\\nVéase también: Batalla de Manila (1945)\\nLos sentimientos revolucionarios se intensificaron en 1872, cuando tres sacerdotes, Mariano Gómez , José Burgos y Jacinto Zamora —conocidos como Gomburza —, fueron acusados de sedición y ejecutados por las autoridades coloniales. [51] \\u200b [52] \\u200b Esto inspiró un movimiento de propaganda en España organizado por Marcelo H. del Pilar , José Rizal y Mariano Ponce , quienes presionaron al gobierno para introducir reformas políticas en Filipinas. Finalmente Rizal fue arrestado y, acusado de rebelión, ejecutado el 30 de diciembre de 1896. [55] \\u200b Como los intentos para lograr estas reformas encontraron una gran resistencia, en 1892 Andrés Bonifacio fundó una sociedad secreta llamada Katipunan , relacionada con grupos de masones que buscaban la independencia del gobierno español por medio de una revuelta armada. [53] \\u200b Bonifacio y Katipunan comenzaron la Revolución filipina en 1896. Una facción del Katipunan, los Magdalo de la provincia de Cavite , llegó a desafiar la posición de Bonifacio como líder de la revolución y Emilio Aguinaldo lo relevó.\\nEdición de The Tribune del 24 de abril de 1942, anunciando la invasión japonesa de Filipinas.\\nEn 1898, la Guerra hispano-estadounidense comenzó en Cuba y posteriormente se extendió al archipiélago filipino ya sumergido en una revuelta. El 12 de junio de 1898, Aguinaldo declaró la independencia filipina de España en Kawit , Cavite, y al año siguiente se estableció la Primera República Filipina . Por su parte, cuando España perdió la guerra firmó el Tratado de París en 1898 , en el cual cedió el dominio de las islas a Estados Unidos por US$ 20 millones. [22] \\u200b Como se hacía cada vez más evidente que los Estados Unidos no reconocerían a la Primera República Filipina, estalló la Guerra filipino-estadounidense . Al perder el conflicto, el archipiélago terminó bajo el control total estadounidense, ya que hasta entonces había sido administrado como un área insular ; en 1935, Filipinas obtuvo el estatus de « Estado libre asociado » [23] \\u200b bajo el nombre de Mancomunidad Filipina .\\nEn la década siguiente, los planes por recuperar la independencia fueron interrumpidos por la Segunda Guerra Mundial , en particular cuando el Imperio japonés invadió el país y estableció un gobierno títere , la Segunda República Filipina . Durante el conflicto se cometieron múltiples crímenes de guerra , como la Marcha de la Muerte de Batán y la Masacre de Manila , que culminó con la batalla de Manila . [56] \\u200b Los crímenes contra la población de origen español y los asaltos a las sedes oficiales españolas en Filipinas provocaron gran inquietud en el gobierno de Francisco Franco . Como consecuencia, España rompió las relaciones diplomáticas con Japón el 12 de abril de 1945. [57] \\u200b Para cuando las tropas aliadas hubieron derrotado a los japoneses en 1945, más de un millón de filipinos habían muerto. [58] \\u200b Finalmente, el 4 de julio de 1946 , Filipinas alcanzó su independencia del gobierno estadounidense. [6] \\u200b\\nDictadura de Marcos y Tercera República Filipina[ editar ]\\nFerdinand e Imelda Marcos en su visita a Estados Unidos en 1966.\\nTras lograr su independencia, la joven nación se enfrentó a varios problemas: el país tenía que ser reconstruido de los estragos de la guerra y llegar a un acuerdo con varios colaboradores y empresarios japoneses para comenzar su desarrollo económico. Mientras tanto, el Hukbalahap , un ejército rebelde comunista que anteriormente luchaba contra los japoneses, continuaba activo en las regiones rurales. Finalmente, esta amenaza fue abordada por el Secretario de la Defensa Nacional y posterior presidente Ramón Magsaysay , aunque se siguieron presentando algunos casos esporádicos de insurgencia comunista. [25] \\u200b [59] \\u200b En 1965, Ferdinand Marcos fue elegido presidente, con su esposa Imelda Marcos a su lado. Como la Constitución prohibía ser reelegido más de dos veces para el cargo presidencial, al final de su segundo mandato declaró la ley marcial el 21 de septiembre de 1972. Para seguir gobernando por decreto, utilizó como argumentos la división política, la tensión de la Guerra Fría y el espectro de la rebelión comunista y de la insurgencia islámica en el país. [60] \\u200b De esta manera inició una dictadura que duró más de diez años y que se caracterizó por el estricto control de la economía y por la represión política. [61] \\u200b [62] \\u200b\\nEl 21 de agosto de 1983, Benigno «Ninoy» Aquino, Jr. , líder de la oposición al gobierno de Marcos, ignoró las advertencias y regresó del exilio en Estados Unidos. Fue asesinado al aterrizar su avión en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Manila —ahora llamado Aeropuerto Internacional Ninoy Aquino, en su memoria—. Al aumentar la presión política, Marcos convocó a elecciones presidenciales en 1986. [25] \\u200b Corazón Aquino , viuda de Benigno, se convirtió en la líder de la oposición y en candidata para la contienda presidencial. Cuando Marcos se proclamó ganador, muchos pensaron que las elecciones habían estado arregladas. Esto condujo a la Revolución EDSA , instigada cuando dos de los aliados más antiguos de Marcos — Fidel V. Ramos , Jefe del Estado Mayor adjunto de las Fuerzas Armadas, y Juan Ponce Enrile , Secretario de la Defensa Nacional— renunciaron y se manifestaron en el campo Aguinaldo y el campo Crame. El Cardenal Arzobispo de Manila, Jaime Sin , exhortó a las personas a reunirse en apoyo a los líderes rebeldes y a protestar en la Avenida Epifanio de los Santos (EDSA). Ante las protestas masivas y las deserciones militares, Marcos y sus aliados huyeron a Hawái , donde fueron exiliados. Ese mismo año, Corazón Aquino fue nombrada presidenta. [59] \\u200b [63] \\u200b\\nEl retorno de la democracia y las reformas al gobierno después de los sucesos de 1986 se vieron obstaculizados por la deuda nacional, la corrupción , los intentos de golpe de Estado , una persistente insurgencia comunista y los movimientos separatistas islámicos. Aunque la economía mejoró durante la administración de Fidel V. Ramos, quien fue elegido presidente en 1992, [24] \\u200b el inicio de la crisis financiera asiática de 1997 frenó estos avances. En 2001, en medio de acusaciones de corrupción y un proceso de destitución estancado, el sucesor de Ramos, Joseph Estrada , fue expulsado de la presidencia por la Revolución de EDSA de 2001 y reemplazado por Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo . Finalmente, como resultado de las elecciones de mayo de 2010 , Benigno «Noynoy» Aquino III fue elegido presidente. [64] \\u200b En noviembre de 2013 el tifón Haiyan devastó la parte central del archipiélago, afectó a más de once millones de filipinos y provocó la muerte de más de cinco mil personas; [65] \\u200b [66] \\u200b la prensa criticó la lenta respuesta por parte del gobierno de Aquino III. [67] \\u200b\\nGobierno y política[ editar ]\\nEl presidente Rodrigo Duterte .\\nFilipinas es una república constitucional con un sistema presidencial de gobierno, administrado como un Estado unitario , con la excepción de la Región Autónoma del Mindanao Musulmán , que es en gran parte independiente del gobierno nacional. El presidente actúa como Jefe de Estado y Jefe de gobierno , además de ser el Comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas . Es elegido por voto popular para un periodo único de seis años, durante el cual él mismo elige y preside su propio gabinete . [7] \\u200b El vicepresidente también es elegido por sufragio directo para un periodo de seis años, y puede reelegirse una vez. El vicepresidente puede ocupar un puesto en el gabinete, y en caso de que el presidente muera o renuncie, se convertiría en el presidente interino y convocaría elecciones. A nivel local, el poder ejecutivo está representado por los gobernadores de las provincias, los alcaldes de las ciudades y municipios y por los capitanes de los barangay . [68] \\u200b\\nEl Congreso bicameral está compuesto por el Senado —equivalente a la cámara alta , con miembros elegidos para un periodo de seis años— y la Cámara de Representantes —la cámara baja , con miembros elegidos para un periodo de tres años—. Los senadores son elegidos al mismo tiempo que el presidente, mientras que los representantes se eligen mediante distritos legislativos y por medio de representación proporcional . [7] \\u200b El Congreso se encarga de la creación y aprobación de leyes y reformas a la constitución por medio de resoluciones y proyectos de ley . Para que cualquier proyecto de ley sea aprobado debe recibir más de dos tercios de los votos a favor en ambas cámaras. [69] \\u200b\\nEl poder judicial está encabezado por la Corte Suprema , compuesta por el Jefe de Justicia como el juez presidente y catorce jueces asociados, los cuales son elegidos por el presidente de entre varios candidatos propuestos por el Consejo de Justicia y Colegio de Abogados. [7] \\u200b El poder judicial goza de una autonomía fiscal, aunque se encuentra supervisado por la Oficina del Administrador de las Cortes. La Corte Suprema también promulga el reglamento de todas las cortes y participa en el proceso de enseñanza de los futuros abogados . [70] \\u200b Desde la administración del gobierno de Ramos, hubo varios intentos por reformar el gobierno a un sistema federal , unicameral o parlamentario . [71] \\u200b [72] \\u200b\\nEl presidente Noynoy Aquino ante el Congreso de Filipinas.\\nEl sistema legal establecido por la Constitución de 1987 contiene elementos heredados de la época del dominio español y estadounidense. Por ejemplo, aquellas cuestiones sobre propiedad, familia y la ausencia de un jurado en los juicios son característicos del derecho continental , existente en España. Sin embargo, el derecho anglosajón instalado por los Estados Unidos a principios del siglo XX es el que rige en algunas de las cuestiones legales más importantes. Entre estas, destacan el comercio, las relaciones laborales, los impuestos, la banca y la moneda. [73] \\u200b\\nEl sistema multipartidista filipino permite la existencia de numerosos partidos políticos, aunque en la práctica es común que se creen alianzas para obtener más votos durante las contiendas electorales. Por su parte, la Comisión de Elecciones (Comelec) definió seis partidos como los más importantes en el país: el Partido Liberal , el Lakas Kampi CMD , el Partido Nacionalista , la Coalición Popular Nacionalista , el Partido de la Unión Nacional y la Alianza Unida Nacionalista . [74] \\u200b Desde 1992, las elecciones nacionales y locales se celebran cada tres años el segundo lunes de mayo. Solo las elecciones para presidente y vicepresidente se realizan cada seis años. [75] \\u200b La edad mínima para votar es de 18 años. En las últimas elecciones presidenciales, celebradas en 2010, participaron poco más de 38 millones de votantes, un 74,34\\xa0% de los registrados en el padrón electoral. [76] \\u200b Benigno Aquino III y Jejomar Binay fueron electos para el puesto de presidente y vicepresidente en 2010, respectivamente, pero tras las elecciones del 9 de mayo de 2016, Rodrigo Duterte ganó la presidencia. [77] \\u200b [78] \\u200b\\nAunque en Filipinas la homosexualidad no es ilegal, existe cierta discriminación por parte de la sociedad en general hacia este grupo. Hasta 2009 los homosexuales tenían prohibido alistarse a las fuerzas armadas. [79] \\u200b Aunque se han realizado múltiples esfuerzos en la lucha por los derechos de la comunidad LGBT , el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo aún es ilegal y no existe reconocimiento para las uniones legales efectuadas en otros países.

Rómulo , fue Presidente de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas . El país es un participante activo en el Consejo de Derechos Humanos , así como en las misiones de mantenimiento de la paz, sobre todo en Timor Oriental . [82] \\u200b [83] \\u200b [84] \\u200b [85] \\u200b\\nAdemás de su participación en la ONU, el país es uno de los fundadores y miembro activo de la Asociación de Naciones del Sudeste Asiático (ASEAN), una organización diseñada para fortalecer las relaciones y promover el crecimiento económico y cultural entre los estados de la región del sudeste de Asia . [86] \\u200b Ha sido sede en varias de sus cumbres y es un contribuyente activo en la dirección y las políticas del bloque. [87] \\u200b Las relaciones que actualmente disfruta con otros estados del sudeste de Asia contrastan con la situación de la década de 1970, cuando estaba en guerra con Vietnam y se disputaba el territorio de Sabah con Malasia , si bien aún existen desacuerdos respecto a las Islas Spratly .

[81] \\u200b No obstante, en años recientes la presencia estadounidense en las bases militares de Bahía Subic y Clark y el Acuerdo de Fuerzas Visitantes han generado cierta controversia. [81] \\u200b También Japón , el mayor contribuyente oficial de ayuda para el desarrollo del país, es considerado como uno de sus principales aliados. [91] \\u200b Aunque aún prevalecen ciertos debates históricos entre los dos países —sobre todo en temas como las mujeres de confort —, gran parte de la enemistad surgida por los acontecimientos de la Segunda Guerra Mundial han desaparecido. [92] \\u200b\\nFilipinas también ha entablado buenas relaciones con otras naciones. El hecho de compartir varios valores democráticos facilita sus relaciones con los países europeos y occidentales. Los problemas económicos por los que atraviesa le ayudan a crear vínculos con otros países en desarrollo que cursan con obstáculos similares. Del mismo modo, los lazos históricos y las similitudes culturales estrechan las relaciones con España y América Latina . [93] \\u200b A pesar de los problemas que afectan a los trabajadores filipinos en el extranjero, como el abuso doméstico y la guerra, así como los obstáculos planteados por una insurgencia islámica en Mindanao, las relaciones con los países del Medio Oriente —incluidos Egipto , Irán , Irak , Libia , Arabia Saudita y los Emiratos Árabes Unidos — son buenas, lo que permite que los más de dos millones de filipinos puedan seguir viviendo y trabajando en la región. [94] \\u200b Por su parte, las relaciones con la República Popular China han mejorado considerablemente, en especial desde la década de 1950. Sin embargo, varias cuestiones relacionadas con el reconocimiento de la República de China , la posesión de las Islas Spratly y la preocupación del crecimiento de la influencia china, impiden una relación estrecha entre ambos vecinos. [92] \\u200b Recientemente, la política exterior filipina se ha ido encaminando principalmente a entablar mejores relaciones económicas con sus vecinos del sudeste asiático y del Pacífico.

Otros grupos militantes como el Frente de Liberación Islámica Moro , los comunistas del Nuevo Ejército del Pueblo y Abu Sayyaf aún luchan en otras provincias, pero su presencia se ha reducido en años recientes, gracias a los operativos de seguridad implantados por el gobierno. [96] \\u200b [97] \\u200b\\nTambién cabe destacar que Filipinas ha sido un aliado de los Estados Unidos desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial : en 1951, ambos países firmaron un tratado de defensa mutua. Filipinas apoyó la ideología estadounidense durante la Guerra Fría , así como su participación en las guerras de Corea y Vietnam . Incluso, fue miembro de la disuelta SEATO , una organización cuyo objetivo era efectuar un papel similar a la OTAN en la región, entre cuyos miembros se encontraban Australia , Francia , Nueva Zelanda , Pakistán , Tailandia , Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. [98] \\u200b Después del inicio de la Guerra contra el terrorismo , el ejército filipino fue parte de la coalición que brindó apoyo a los EE.

As all of Nepomuceno\\'s films are lost, most of the information was gathered from old newspaper articles on microfilm in different archives in Manila. Many of these articles were hitherto undiscovered. Nepomuceno made silent films at a time when the influence of the new coloniser, United States, was growing, and the Spanish language was what unified the intellectual opposition. Previous research on Nepomuceno has focused on the Hispanic influences on his filmmaking, as well as his connections to the stage drama. This paper argues that Nepomuceno created a national consciousness by making films showing native lives and environments, adapting important Filipino novels and plays to the screen and covering important political topics and thereby creating public opinion. Many reviews in the newspapers connected his films to nation-building and independence, as the creation of a national consciousness is a cornerstone in the process of building a nation and defining \"Filipino\". Furthermore, the films of Nepomuceno helped spreading the Tagalog culture and language to other parts of the Philippines, hence making Tagalog the foundation of the national Filipino language.\\nPlace, publisher, year, edition, pages\\n2006. , 75 p.\\nAsia, the Philippines, film history, history, nation, culture, identity, Nepomuceno, colonisation, language, archive studies\\nNational Category\\n', 24]\n",

In 2000, roughly one-third of the population (nearly 27 million Filipinos) lacked the roughly US$275 required annually to satisfy food and non-food basic needs, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) estimates. Such poverty, exacerbated by prolonged El Niño-induced drought and the residual effects of the 1997/1998 financial crisis that shook the region, limits the ability of the poor to gain access to health and other services.\\nThe Philippines is also among the world's fastest urbanizing countries, and overcrowded cities present their own challenges. With some 47 percent of the population living in urban areas, compared with 31 percent in Thailand and 16 percent in Cambodia, the country has more than 200 urban areas that have populations of more than 50,000, notes the country's Commission on Population (POPCOM). By World Bank estimates, these urban centers could expand to some 600 by 2020, largely because high levels of rural poverty are pushing people into the cities.\\nThe concentration of economic development in relatively few urban areas and rapid population growth throughout the country are other factors contributing to urban sprawl. Compared with other countries in the region, the Philippines is experiencing rapid population growth. The rate of natural increase — the birth rate minus the death rate — is 2.2 percent, compared with 0.8 percent in Thailand and Singapore and 1.9 percent in Malaysia.\\nIn addition to fleeing to urban commercial centers, many people leave the country for work. An average of 2,500 Filipinos leave the country every day for work abroad, and the Philippines is second only to Mexico as an exporter of labor. An estimated 10 percent of the country's population, or nearly 8 million people, are overseas Filipino workers distributed in 182 countries, according to POPCOM. That is in addition to the estimated 3 million migrants who work illegally abroad. According to official statistics of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, Filipino workers abroad sent home US$6.8 billion in 1999 alone. A large proportion of these remittances come from women who are the majority of overseas Filipino workers.\\n\\xa0\\n\", 205]\n",
      "[0.0003988500822530176, 'The Philippines\\' Culture of Migration\\nJanuary 1, 2006\\nProfile\\nBy Maruja M.B. Asis\\nSince the 1970s, the Philippines — a country of about 7,000 islands peopled by diverse ethno-linguistic groups — has supplied all kinds of skilled and low-skilled workers to the world\\'s more developed regions. As of December 2004, an estimated 8.1 million Filipinos — nearly 10 percent of the country\\'s 85 million people — were working and/or residing in close to 200 countries and territories.\\nAlthough the Philippines is largely a country of emigration, it also attracts some foreigners to its shores. Traditionally, the foreign population in the Philippines consists of people of Chinese origin (some 80 percent of overseas Chinese are in Southeast Asia) and some people of Indian origin who came to settle in the country years ago.\\nPresently, there are 36,150 foreign nationals working and residing in the Philippines. The inflows of foreigners to the country, as well as concerns for unauthorized migration and the use of the Philippines as a transit point for other destinations, point to a reality in this age of migration: that countries can no longer be neatly and exclusively classified as countries of origin, transit, or destination.\\nMuch of the country\\'s attention and policies, though, are focused on emigration. A film released in June 2005, La Visa Loca, captures an ordinary Filipino\\'s feverish quest for a U.S. visa, the perceived ticket to a better life. In reality, the quest for a visa is not limited to the United States. Other promised lands in different regions — the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Oceania — have become the objects of Filipino dreams.\\nIn the last 30 years, a \"culture of migration\" has emerged, with millions of Filipinos eager to work abroad, despite the risks and vulnerabilities they are likely to face. A nationwide survey of 1,200 adult respondents in 2002 found one in five Filipinos expressing a desire to migrate.\\nMore recent surveys carried out by Pulse Asia in 2005 found an increasing percentage of adult respondents — 26 percent in July and 33 percent in October — agreeing with the statement, \"If it were only possible, I would migrate to another country and live there.\" Interest in leaving the country is not limited to adults. In a nationwide survey in 2003 of children ages 10 to 12, 47 percent reported that they wished to work abroad someday. Sixty percent of children of overseas foreign workers said they had plans to work abroad.\\nThe development of a culture of migration in the Philippines has been greatly aided by migration\\'s institutionalization. The government facilitates migration, regulates the operations of the recruitment agencies, and looks out for the rights of its migrant workers. More importantly, the remittances workers send home have become a pillar of the country\\'s economy.\\nHistorical Background\\nAfter more than three centuries of Spanish colonial rule, the revolution waged by Filipinos in 1896 almost led to the end of Spanish rule. After a year of fighting, the revolutionaries and the Spanish authorities signed a truce in December 1897, and General Emilio Aguinaldo went into exile in Hong Kong.\\nThe Spanish-American War broke out in February 1898, sparked by the United States\\' support for Cuba\\'s fight against Spain. This spilled over into the Philippines. An American fleet led by Admiral George Dewey arrived in Manila, defeating Spanish forces in the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898.\\nUpon the urging of Admiral Dewey to resume the fight against Spain, General Aguinaldo returned to Manila on May 18, 1898. General Aguinaldo\\'s forces liberated several towns south of Manila and declared independence from Spain on June 12, 1898. More American forces arrived, and the Spaniards surrendered Manila to the Americans that August.\\nOn December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris was signed between the United States and Spain, formally ending the Spanish-American War. Under the treaty, the United States paid Spain to take control of the Philippines. Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Mariana Islands were ceded to the United States as well.\\nFilipinos resisted American rule, and the ensuing Philippine-American War, which began in 1899, dragged on even after it \"officially\" ended with the capture of General Aguinaldo in 1901, followed by the establishment of a civil government throughout the Philippines in 1902. The Philippines became independent in July 1946, after the Japanese invasion and occupation of World War II.\\nFor much of the 20th century, \"international migration\" for Filipinos meant going to the United States and its Pacific territories. The first batch of Filipino workers arrived in the U.S. territory of Hawaii on December 20, 1906 to work on sugarcane and pineapple plantations.\\nMore workers, mostly single men, followed; others left Hawaii to work in agriculture in California, Washington, and Oregon, or the salmon canneries of Alaska. On the mainland, low-wage service work in the cities — waiters, busboys, or domestic work — provided alternative jobs between agricultural seasons or when other jobs are not available. Some 4,000 Filipinos were employed in the merchant marine, but this employment possibility ceased with the 1937 passage of a law requiring the crew of U.S. flag vessels to be at least 90 percent American citizens.\\nAccording to one estimate, approximately 120,000 Filipino workers came to Hawaii between 1906 and 1934. Another estimate puts the number of Filipinos arriving in the United States between 1907 and the 1930 at 150,000, the majority of whom were in Hawaii. A small number of scholars, known as pensionados, also immigrated to the United States before the 1920s. They were either sponsored by the U.S. government or by missionary-related programs. Some were sent by rich families to study and a few were self-supporting students. Those who returned assumed important positions in Filipino society while others remained in the United States.\\nBecause the Philippines was a U.S. colony, the movement of Filipinos to the United States was considered internal migration and Filipino migrants were \"nationals\" (but not citizens). It was not until the passage of the 1934 Tydings-McDuffie Law (also known as the Philippines Independence Act of 1934), which provided for the granting of Philippine independence in 10 years\\' time, that the Philippines became subject to immigration quotas. The 1934 law limited the Philippines to 50 visas per year, and migration dropped off dramatically.\\nBut even so, there was an exception clause: in case of a labor shortage, the governor of Hawaii was authorized to hire Filipino workers. As nationals, Filipinos were entitled to American passports and could enter and leave the country freely. World War II intervened and further migration to the United States stalled. Between 1946 and the mid 1960s, about 10,000 to 12,000 Filipinos came to Hawaii as workers, military personnel, and war brides.\\nIt was not until the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, when nationality-based restrictions were struck down, that Filipino immigration grew and diversified.\\nOther countries of settlement also dismantled their pro-European immigration policies in the 1960s and 1970s, paving the way for Filipinos to enter Canada, Australia, and New Zealand under family or skills-based provisions. The Philippines eventually became one of the top 10 sending countries in these traditional immigration countries.\\nFilipinos also settled in countries that are not traditional countries of immigration, such as Germany and Japan, through marriage or work-related migration. This permanent migration, however, was overshadowed by the larger and thornier temporary labor migration that started in the 1970s.\\nBecoming a Labor Exporter\\nThe Philippines\\' ascent as a major labor exporter in Asia and worldwide is based on various factors. When large-scale labor migration from the Philippines started in the 1970s, the \"push\" factors were very strong but made worse by the oil crisis in 1973. Among others, economic growth could not keep up with population growth. The country was hard pressed to provide jobs and decent wages and had severe balance of payment problems.\\nAt the same time, the oil-rich Gulf countries needed workers to realize their ambitious infrastructure projects. With supply and demand factors converging, the Philippines was ripe for large-scale labor migration, an opportunity the Marcos government recognized. The framework for what became the government\\'s overseas employment program was established with the passage of the Labor Code of the Philippines in 1974.\\nThe Philippines\\' foray into organized international labor migration was supposed to be temporary, lasting only until the country recovered from its economic problems. However, the continuing demand for workers in the Gulf countries and the opening of new labor markets in other regions, especially in East and Southeast Asia, fueled further migration.\\nOn the supply side, the push factors have not abated. The absence of sustained economic development, political instability, a growing population, double-digit unemployment levels, and low wages continue to compel people to look abroad.\\nThe flow of overseas foreign workers (OFWs), numbering a few thousand per year in the early 1970s, has grown to hundreds of thousands (see Table 1). In 2004 alone, 933,588 OFWs left the country. Based on trends, it is expected that the number of deployed OFWs will hit the one million mark in 2005.\\nTable 1. Annual Deployment of Filipino Workers, 1975-2004*\\nYear\\n229,002\\n933,588\\n*Figures for 1975 to 1983 refer to number of contracts processed; figures for 1984 to 2004 refer to number of workers deployed abroad.\\nSources: Table 5 (Battistella, 1995:265) for figures from 1975 to 1983; available online for figures from 1983 to 2003; and for 2004 data . Internet sources were accessed on 12 September 2005.\\nThe data on deployed workers include seafarers, who account for some 20 percent of all OFWs leaving the country every year (see Table 2). Filipinos dominate the industry: 25 percent of the world\\'s seafarers are from the Philippines.\\nTable 2. Regional Distribution of Land-based Overseas Filipino Workers, 2004*\\nRegion\\n704,586\\n100.00\\n*Based on combined data for new hires and rehires. Source: Available online , accessed 12 September 2005.\\nAs of December 2004, the stock of overseas Filipinos include some 3.2 million permanent settlers (the majority of whom are in the United States), about 3.6 million temporary labor migrants (called OFWs), with Saudi Arabia hosting close to a million, and an estimated 1.3 million migrants in an unauthorized situation. The latter tend to be mostly in the United States and Malaysia.\\nWomen are very visible in international migration from the Philippines. They not only compose the majority of permanent settlers, i.e., as part of family migration, but they are as prominent as men in labor migration. In fact, since 1992, female migrants outnumbered men among the newly hired land-based workers who are legally deployed every year.\\nThe majority of female OFWs are in domestic work and entertainment. Since these are unprotected sectors, female migration has raised many concerns about the safety and well-being of women migrants. Female OFWs can also be found in factory work, sales, and nursing.\\nAmong the top 10 destinations of OFWs, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Singapore, Italy, United Arab Emirates, Japan, and Taiwan are dominated by women OFWs. In Hong Kong, for example, more than 90 percent of OFWs are women (Table 2).\\nHow Labor Export Works\\nWith its low rate of foreign investment and a steady reduction in development assistance, the government, not just its people, has come to rely on overseas employment as a strategy for survival. After years of pushing the official line that it does not promote overseas employment, the government set a target in 2001 of deploying a million workers overseas every year, a goal it is likely to meet in 2005.\\nSince the 1970s, the government and the private sector each have played a role in the labor export process. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) grew out of the Overseas Employment Development Board and the National Seamen Board in the then Ministry of Labor and Employment. POEA became the government agency responsible for processing workers\\' contracts and predeployment checks, as well as for licensing, regulating, and monitoring private recruitment agencies.\\nWhen the overseas program started, the government participated in recruiting and matching workers and employers. Due to demand for workers and the large numbers involved, the government relinquished the placement of workers to private recruitment agencies in 1976. There is a placement branch within the POEA, but it only accounts for a small number of all OFWs placed with foreign employers.\\nOn the private-sector side, there are more than 1,000 government-licensed recruitment and manning agencies in the Philippines (and an unknown number of unlicensed ones) that match workers with foreign employers. In the Philippines, recruitment agencies refer to those that find jobs for aspiring land-based migrant workers; manning agencies refer to those that engage in recruiting and finding jobs for seafarers.\\nRecruitment agencies charge migrant workers \"placement fees\" for the service that they provide. Manning agencies are not supposed to charge placement fees as these fees are assumed by the principal or employer, but there are cases of known violations.\\nAlthough there is a standard placement fee for most destinations (except for special markets such as Taiwan) which is equivalent to one month\\'s salary plus 5,000 Philippine pesos (about US$94) for documentation, this is routinely violated. The excessive fees are a burden to migrants and put them in a vulnerable situation because they are already in debt before they leave. When they are abroad, they go without any salary for a period of time, and they are forced to bear harsh working and living conditions in order to repay their loans.\\nAnother government agency, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), provides support and assistance to migrants and their families. All processes and requirements up until the point of departure are handled by the POEA, while the OWWA assumes responsibility for the workers\\' welfare while they are employed abroad. POEA and OWWA are under the Department of Labor and Employment.\\nA separate agency, the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO), provides programs and services to permanent emigrants. CFO was transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Office of the President in 2004.\\nAmong the countries of origin in Asia, the Philippines offers a fairly comprehensive package of programs and services covering all phases of migration, from predeparture to on-site services to return and reintegration. Although the government could improve its implementation of these programs, the programs demonstrate the government\\'s efforts to balance the marketing of workers with protection.\\nSome of these initiatives, such as the predeparture orientation seminars for departing workers and the deployment of labor attachés and welfare officers to countries with large OFW populations, are good practices that other countries of origin have also implemented.\\nProtecting Workers Abroad\\nThe irregular operations of recruitment agencies in the Philippines and their counterparts in the countries of destination are one of the sources of vulnerabilities for migrant workers. Excessive placement fees, contract substitution, nonpayment or delayed wages, and difficult working and living conditions are common problems encountered by migrant workers, including legal ones.\\nMigrant women face particular vulnerabilities. Aside from the usual problems that plague migrants, their jobs in domestic work and entertainment usually mean long working hours, surveillance and control by employers, and abusive conditions, including violence and sexual harassment. Given the \"private\" context in which they work, the problems encountered by migrant women in these sectors go unnoticed.\\nIn general, compared to other national groups, Filipino workers are relatively better protected because they are more educated, more likely to speak English, and they are better organized. NGOs for migrants in the Philippines and their networks abroad not only provide services and support to migrants, but, more importantly, they advocate for migrants\\' rights\\nThe development of a legal and institutional framework to promote migrant workers\\' protection is also an important factor. The Philippines was the first among the countries of origin in Asia to craft a law that aims \"to establish a higher standard of protection and promotion of the welfare of migrant workers, their families and overseas Filipinos in distress.\" Although there had been discussions about a Magna Charta for migrant workers for some time, it was not until 1995 that the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act (also known as Republic Act or RA8042) was finally passed.\\nThe tipping point was the national furor in 1995 over the execution of Flor Contemplación, a domestic worker in Singapore, who many Filipinos believed was innocent despite her conviction for the deaths of her Singaporean ward and another Filipino domestic worker. This was a factor in fast-tracking the passage of RA8042.\\nBriefly, the law\\'s provisions include:\\nthe deployment of workers in countries that ensure protection, including the banning of deployment if necessary;\\nproviding support and assistance to overseas Filipinos, whether legal or in an unauthorized situation;\\nimposing stiff penalties for illegal recruiters;\\nfree legal assistance and witness protection program for victims of illegal recruitment;\\nthe institution of advisory/information, repatriation, and reintegration services;\\nthe stipulation that the \"protection of Filipino migrant workers and the promotion of their welfare, in particular, and the protection of the dignity and fundamental rights and freedoms of the Filipino abroad, in general, shall be the his/her priority concerns of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Foreign Service Posts;\"\\nthe establishment of the Migrant Workers and Other Overseas Filipinos Resource Centers in countries where there are large numbers of Filipinos;\\nand the creation of the Legal Assistant for Migrant Workers Affairs (now the Office of the Undersecretary of Migrant Workers Affairs) and the Legal Assistance Fund.\\nThe haste with which RA8042 was passed has resulted in some problematic provisions, leading to calls for amendments. For example, in the Declaration of Policies, it is mentioned that \"the State does not promote overseas employment as a means to sustain economic growth and achieve national development.\" Some sectors, such as the NGO community, believe the state does promote labor migration.\\nOne controversial provision is Section 29, which deals with the deregulation of recruitment activities. If this were implemented, the regulatory functions of the POEA would have been phased out in 2001, that is, within five years of the law becoming effective. NGOs are against the deregulation plan because the playing field already is highly uneven. The recruitment agencies, on the other hand, are pushing for deregulation.\\nOverall, RA8042 has not been a complete failure. Some provisions have been implemented well (e.g., there are various information programs in place); some need to be fine-tuned, notably programs dealing with returning migrants and their reintegration in the local economy. There are also moves to amend certain sections of the law.\\nThe Office of the Undersecretary of Migrant Workers Affairs, under the Department of Foreign Affairs, provides assistance to migrant workers who encounter legal problems abroad, while the National Labor Relations Council handles employment-related problems such as money claims.\\nIn addition to government initiatives, the efforts of NGOs, church-based organizations, and migrants\\' organizations, as well as transnational and international efforts directed at promoting and protecting migrants\\' rights, help provide an \"antidote\" to the dangers of migration.\\nAmong the countries of origin in Asia, the Philippines is also a leader in introducing several migration-related laws. These include:\\nthe Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, which establishes policies and institutional mechanisms to provide support to trafficked persons;\\nthe Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003, which gives qualified overseas Filipinos the right to vote in national elections; and\\nthe Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003, which allows for dual citizenship.\\nIn terms of commitments to international norms and standards concerning migrants, the Philippines is one of 34 countries (as of October 27, 2005) that has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families. It is also one of 95 countries (as of November 6, 2005) that has ratified the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.\\nRemittances\\nAside from easing unemployment, Filipinos who choose to work abroad send home remittances that have become an important pillar of the Philippine economy (see Table 3). In 2004, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, remittances sent through formal channels amounted to US$8.5 billion. In 2005, remittances are expected to reach US$10 billion.\\nTable 3.

      "[0.00033853384148193965, 'COUNTRY NAME : Republic of the Philippines\\nFORM OF GOVERNMENT : Democratic\\nCAPITAL : Manila\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe visitor to Metro Manila commonly sees the Philippines as the most westernized   of Asian countries and in many ways, it is. But there is also a rich underlay   of Malay culture beneath the patina of Spanish and American heritage. National   cultural life is a happy marriage of many influences, as the indigenous Malay   culture is assimilated and adapted to different strains in a practice typical   of Malay temperament. An upsurge of Philippine nationalism stimulated a desire   to preserve the ancient heritage without restricting its openness to foreign   artistic influence.\\nThe Philippines is an archipelago of 7,107 islands. It stretches from the south of China to the northern tip of Borneo. The country has over a hundred ethnic groups and a mixture of foreign influences which have molded a unique Filipino culture.\\nBefore the Spanish explorers came, Indo-Malays and Chinese merchants had settled   here. In 1521, the Spaniards, led by Ferdinand Magellan, discovered the islands.   The Spanish conquistadores established a colonial government in Cebu in 1565.   They transferred the seat of government to Manila in 1571 and proceeded to   colonize the country. The Filipinos resisted and waged Asia\\'s first nationalist   revolution in 1896. On June 12, 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo declared the Philippines   independent from Spain and proclaimed himself president. After ruling for 333   years, the Spaniards finally left in 1898 and were replaced by the Americans   who stayed for 48 years. On July 4, 1946, the Americans recognized Philippine   independence.\\nThe Philippines is the third largest English-speaking country in the world.   The country is divided into three geographical areas: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.   It has 17 regions,   81 provinces, 118 cities, 1,510 municipalities , and 41,995 barangays. (Barangay   - The smallest political unit into which cities and municipalities in the Philippines   are divided. It is the basic unit of the Philippine political system. It consists   of less than 1,000 inhabitants residing within the territorial limit of a city   or municipality and administered by a set of elective officials, headed by   a barangay chairman or punong barangay). Data as of December 2006.\\nGEOGRAPHY\\nThe Philippine archipelago is geographically located between latitude (approximately)   4o23\\'N   and  21o25\\'N and longitude (approximately) 112oE and 127oE.   It is composed of 7,107 islands, with a land area of 299,764 sq.kilometers.   Its length measures 1,850 kilometers, starting from the point near the southern   tip of Taiwan and ending close to northern Borneo. Its breadth is about 965   kilometers. The Philippine coastline adds up to 17,500 km. Three prominent   bodies of water surround the archipelago: the Pacific Ocean on the east, the   South China Sea on the west and north, and the Celebes Sea on the south. This   position accounts for much of the variations in geographic, climatic and vegetational   conditions in the country.\\nThe topography of the bigger islands - particularly Luzon and Mindanao - is characterized by alluvial plains, narrow valleys, rolling hills and high mountains. The highest mountains are found in Mindanao and Luzon, with the altitudes varying from 1,790 to 3,144 meters. Most of the smaller islands are mountainous in the interior, surrounded by narrow strips of discontinuous flat lowlands which constitute the coastal rims. The shorelines of both large and small islands are irregular.\\nThe Philippines\\' fertile land accounts for the more than 900 species of orchids representing 100 genera that have been found. The sampaguita is the national flower.\\nAmong the country\\'s fauna are some endangered species like the Philippine   Eagle, the tarsier, and the mouse deer.\\nMetro Manila is strategically located in the middle of Luzon, on the eastern coast of Manila Bay and at the mouth of the Pasig River, sprawled over an area of 626 sq.km. Manila sits in the middle of a swampy deltaic plain formed by accumulated sedimentary deposits from the Pasig River and other streams.\\nThe city is between the bay to the west, the highlands to the east, and Laguna de Bay to the southeast. Most of its densely populated areas are found along the Pasig River running across the metropolis dividing it into two sections - the north and the south.\\nTIME ZONE:\\nGMT + 8 hours. Check out the Philippine Standard Time\\nCAPSULE HISTORY\\nBefore the Spanish conquistadores came, a thriving community flourished on the banks of the Pasig River. It was called \"Maynilad\", after the nilad plant whose star-shaped flowers clustered in abundance along the low-lying river banks.\\nThe lord of the riverside kingdom was Raha Sulayman who held court on the south side of the river while his uncle, Lakandula, ruled on the north side. The Spaniards were set on conquering this community. After the savage Battle of Bangkusay, where they overtook the natives with their awesome firepower, the Spaniards conquered Manila. In this Battle, Sulayman was killed.\\nRealizing its strategic position as a trading center and military outpost, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, head of the Spanish expedition, promptly declared Manila the capital of the new colonies won by Spain. On June 24, 1571, Manila was declared the capital of the entire achipelago. Delighted by this conquest, the King of Spain awarded the city a coat of arms and the grandiose title: \"The Noble and Ever Loyal City\". Soon, Manila became a replica of a European medieval city. There were churches, palaces and city halls built in the Spanish baroque style. Work began on building a wall around the city to keep the pirates and Moros at bay. It took 150 years to finish this wall. The end result was an astounding eight foot-thick, three mile-long wall, with two forts and a bastion, 370 guns in place, manned by a force of 5,000 men and 10,000 reserves. This walled city became known as Intramuros.\\nBeautiful as it was, Intramuros stood as a perfect illustration of the discrimination at that time against the natives called Indios. Although it was built by Indio workers and Chinese artisans, Intramuros was meant only for the clergy and the Spanish nobility. The natives could not enter except to work as servants. Outside the walls, in the arabales or suburbs, lived the Indios, the Chinese and other foreigners. The diversity of trade and culture in the suburbs made it alive and interesting. Tondo, Binondo, Sta. Cruz, and Quiapo bustled with commerce. These places were home to the merchants, carpenters, blacksmiths, carriage makers, masons, and other artisans.\\nOver the centuries, the Spanish rule was occasionally threatened by attacks from the sea and by internal uprisings. The Chinese, Dutch and British all tried to lay siege on Manila but were unsuccessful. But the 1880\\'s saw the birth of a reform movement led by Marcelo H. Del Pilar, Lopez Jaena and Jose Rizal (the national hero). This reform movement ultimately led to a revolution and by 1898, the days of the Castilian rule were numbered. The most lasting legacy of the Spanish rule was the Catholic religion which makes the Philippines the only Christian nation in Asia.\\nBut as soon as the Spaniards left, the Americans took over. 1902 was the beginning of the American era, a period characterized by the expansion of public education, advances in health care and the introduction of democratic government. The outbreak of war in the Pacific in 1941 disrupted American rule. Manila was declared an open city and the Americans withdrew their defenses. For three years, Manila was occupied by the Japanese imperial forces. Life at that time was made difficult by strict Japanese military rule. When the American troops entered Manila to liberate it, they had to bomb the city to dislodge the tenacious Japanese. Manila was devastated.\\nOn July 4, 1946, a year after the end of the war, the Philippine flag was hoisted signalling the recognition of Philippine independence.\\nTHE PEOPLE\\nThe Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million as of May 2000 (with a projected population of 88.7 million for 2007), and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture.\\nThe Filipino character is actually a little                                    bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan                                    or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos                                    are famous for, is said to be taken from Malay                                    forefathers. The close family relations are                                    said to have been inherited from the Chinese.                                    The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced                                    Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality                                    is a common denominator in the Filipino character                                    and this is what distinguishes the Filipino.                                    Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not                                    the only, English-proficient Oriental people                                    today. Filipino is the official national language,                                    with English considered as the country\\'s unofficial                                    one.\\nThe Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.\\nSome 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain\\'s lasting legacy. About 15 percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. The rest of the population is made up mostly of smaller Christian denominations and Buddhist.\\nThe country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the people of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.\\nHospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life, in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.\\nEthnic Groups: 91.5% Christian Malay, 4% Muslim Malay ,1.5% Chinese and 3% other.\\nCULTURE AND ARTS\\nThe major cultural agencies of government are the Cultural Center of the Philippines , the National Historical Institute , the National Museum, The National Library , the Records Management and Archives Office, and the Commission on the Filipino Language . The Heads of these cultural agencies are all ex-officio members of the NCCA Board and all except the Commission on the Filipino Language are together under the National Commission on Culture and Arts .\\nCLIMATE\\nThe Philippines has a tropical climate with relatively abundant rainfall and gentle winds. There are three pronounced seasons: the wet or rainy season from June to October, the cool, dry season from November to February, and the hot, dry season from March to May.\\nTemperature in Manila ranges from 21°C to 32°C with a 27°C average. The coolest month is January and the warmest is May. Both temperature and humidity levels reach the maximum in April and May, but these are generally good months for aquasports and mountain trekking. Some of the most colorful festivals are held during these months. More info\\nLANGUAGE\\nTwo official languages --- Filipino and English. Filipino, which is based on Tagalog, is the national language. English is also widely used and is the medium of instruction in higher education.\\nEight (8) major dialects spoken by majority of the Filipinos: Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon or Ilonggo, Bicolano, Waray, Pampango, and Pangasinense.\\nFilipino is that native language which is used nationally as the language of communication among ethnic groups . Like any living language, Filipino is in a process of development through loans from Philippine languages and non-native languages for various situations, among speakers of different social backgrounds, and for topics for conversation and scholarly discourse. There are about 76 to 78 major language groups, with more than 500 dialects.\\nRELIGION\\n', 0]\n",

CONDE\\nContinue reading the main story\\nMANILA — Sometime in the late 1970s, Tony Tan Caktiong, the owner of a small ice cream parlor in a lower- middle-class neighborhood here, learned that an American hamburger chain was coming to invade the Philippines.\\nWorried that his store, which had just started selling burgers, might get floored by the new competition, Tan Caktiong, a Filipino of Chinese descent, took a leaf from the Chinese military tactician Sun Tzu: he flew to the United States to know his future enemy.\\nWhen he returned to the Philippines a few weeks later, Tan Caktiong brought with him an arsenal of ideas on how to fortify his store, called Jollibee, to face the newcomer.\\nWhat followed was a classic tale of survival that quickly became a Filipino legend that is now being retold in the country\\'s business schools, often with a tinge of nationalistic pride directed against the U.S. burger chain in question, McDonald\\'s.\\nTan Caktiong had no choice but to reinvent Jollibee.\\n\"He was told that either he sold Jollibee to McDonald\\'s or be its franchise holder here. \\'They will eat you alive,\\' his friends told him,\" said John Victor Tence, vice president for corporate and human resources of Jollibee Foods.\\nDescribed by friends as self-effacing and frugal but determined, Tan Caktiong told his friends, \"I have a third choice: I can fight McDonald\\'s.\"\\nAnd fight he did, using as weapons the very things that made McDonald\\'s successful: the mascot, the colorful uniforms of the crew, their cheerful greetings, French fries, fried chicken and a burger aimed at Filipino tastes and priced much lower.\\n\"He brought the standards of Jollibee notches higher, at least on par with McDonald\\'s, by basically copying what McDonald\\'s was doing,\" Tence said.\\nBy the time McDonald\\'s put up its first store here, in 1981, it no longer offered anything new. Jollibee, meanwhile, was already prepared, having opened nine branches and started an aggressive marketing campaign. Jollibee entered the list of the top 1,000 corporations in the Philippines that same year. By 1984, it was in the Top 500 list and dominated the local fast-food market.\\nThe Philippines, The Economist magazine wrote in 2002, \"is a huge embarrassment to McDonald\\'s,\" citing a Taylor Nelson Sofres study showing that Jollibee was the \"most often visited\" fast-food restaurant in the country.\\nJollibee had grown so big and confident that, in 1986, it opened its first store overseas, in Taiwan. It was a sign of things to come. In 1998, Jollibee would encroach on McDonald\\'s home territory, opening its first U.S. store in Daly City, California, which has a large Filipino population.\\nToday, Jollibee has more than 500 stores in the Philippines and 25 in other countries, selling more than half a million burgers every day. McDonald\\'s has about 250 outlets in the Philippines, according to Cerwin Eviota, a public relations consultant for the chain.\\nAside from the United States and Taiwan, Jollibee also has stores in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Saipan and Brunei, as well as in Vietnam, where sales grew 46 percent in the first quarter of 2004.\\nJollibee Foods also embarked on an ambitious expansion program domestically and overseas, and not just for its flagship stores.\\nIt bought Chowking, a popular Filipino fast-food chain that sells mainly Chinese food; it is now the dominant Chinese fast-food chain in the Philippines and has even entered the Indonesian market. Jollibee also acquired the local franchise for Delifrance, a French café and bakery chain.\\nIt also bought Greenwich, a small pizza chain that has grown larger in the Philippines than another American giant, Pizza Hut. And it acquired Yonghe King, a fast-food chain in China. All in all, Jollibee Foods has 1,186 stores in nine countries, including 120 in China.\\nJollibee is now the largest Filipino food company, with sales of 21.7 billion pesos, or $397 million, in 2004, up 13.7 percent from a year earlier. Sales in the first quarter of 2005 were up almost 20 percent.\\nYonghe King sales in China grew 27 percent in the first quarter. All its other stores are doing well, with Delifrance increasing its sales by almost 32 percent in the first quarter of 2005.\\nThe value of Jollibee stock has grown 28 percent since last year, and it was the best-performing domestic stock on the Philippine stock exchange.\\n1\\n', 14]\n",

El filipino está principalmente basado en la lengua tagala (pariente del malayo), con influencias españolas e inglesas fuertes. Hay unos 3 millones de personas de habla hispana.\\nEl tagalo es la lengua hablada en Luzón central y regiones Tagalog del Sur así como la Región de Capital Nacional (NCR) o Metro Manila. En las provincias Luzón del Norte, el ilocano es la lengua hablada más común . Las provincias de Pangasinan y Pampanga también tienen su propia lengua. Adicional al sur del Metro Manila está la Región Bicol donde es usado el Bicolano. En las Islas del Sur de Bisayas y Mindanao, el cebuano es la lengua más común. Otras lenguas minoritarias en el sur incluyen Hiligaynon y Waray.\\nHay algunos otros grupos étnicos que residen en el país, en particular en más áreas urbanizadas como Manila. El grupo más grande es los chinos - muchos de los cuales han asimilado seemlessly con la sociedad filipina. Otros grupos incluyen a los coreanos, japonés, del Medio Oriente, y los europeos/norteamericanos que comprenden los otros grupos principales.\\nLa comunicación no sería demasiado fastidio para el viajero de habla inglesa, ya que mucha gente tiene conocimientos del idioma. Filipinas también tiene uno de los porcentajes más altos de hablantes realmente bilingües y multilingües en el mundo, superando otras naciones oficialmente bilingües/multilingües y territorios en Asia, como Malasia, Singapur, y Hong Kong. El inglés es extensamente usado por todo el país pero a niveles diferentes, en particular en las grandes ciudades . También es extensamente usado en el gobierno, los medios, y en el comercio. Los signos de la calle y las vallas publicitarias estarán probablemente en inglés, pero los mensajes de servicio público pueden estar en el filipino. El inglés es una asignatura obligatoria en todas las escuelas (públicas y privadas) desde la escuela primaria a la universidad. Además, se ha vuelto a introducir en los institutos públicos la enseñanza del castellano con la ayuda del gobierno español. Prácticamente cada uno que usted encuentre entenderá el inglés, aunque no lo hable con fluidez. De hecho, el inglés es el idioma oficial de negocios.\\nMuchas palabras españolas sobreviven en muchas de las lenguas locales aunque sobre todo en la forma corrompida. (Algunas lenguas locales como el Chabacano son completamente variantes del español.) El español ya no se entiende extensamente pero se puede viajar por la ciudad con un poquito del idioma cervantino, ya que aproximadamente el 45\\xa0% de todas las palabras usadas en el discurso diario es de procedencia española.

A rather unexpected (for some pundits) but worthy inclusion is Richard Somes\\' Yanggaw which for me may be a little known yet highly prized gem of a film.

I am particularly excited that Kimi Dora almost made the list.  I am not a big fan of Joyce Bernal but I just love Eugene Domingo and Chris Martinez.  Chris Martinez I believe wrote Kimi Dora as well as Here Comes the Bride.  However, I think 100 was his best film and I just hope you got to see and maybe it would have been part of the list (as watching the movie is a requirement for it to be on the list).\\nThe brilliance of having a melodramatic topic for a movie (100) but injecting the right kind of humor on some scenes will make Chris Martinez one of the best in the industry in the coming years.  I\\'ve watched 3 of the films he wrote and directed(I am not sure if he did more) and I enjoyed every single one of them.\\nI am sure, this comment will raise some eyebrows with some readers.  I know, more often than not, comedies are not given the same share of, for hte lack of a better word, respect as the heavy drama counterparts.  Although I always believe that it is easy to make people cry but it\\'s really hard to make people laugh.  And for a Chris Martinez, who can make a full movie house laugh out loud in chorus is nothing short of amazing.  By this time, I know some of the eyebrows of some readers reached the tip of their widow\\'s peak however, I think I have to put a disclaimer that this opinion is very personal.  I have not met Chris Martinez and he did not pay me to write this.  These set of words is coming from a guy who was born early 90s and learned to appreciate movies in the mid 2000 already, where Lino Brocka and all those great filmmakers in the 70s and 80s are no longer making films.  I\\'m part of the generation who, some would qualify, as unlucky enough to catch some of these titles in the cinemas.  Our generation have been bombarded by the Mano Pos of Regal and the endless saga of Bong Revilla and Vic Sotto highly-budgeted-on-special-effects movies.\\nAgain, just my two cents. :)\\ntoto Jun 12 2010 @ 06:53am Reply Report Abuse\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nian Jun 12 2010 @ 12:30am Reply Report Abuse\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nweird, that username above should be Ian, not Anna.\\nIt\\'s been corrected. :)  (Must be a weird glitch of sorts). --SPOT.ph\\nian Jun 12 2010 @ 12:29am Reply Report Abuse\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\ni wanted to include one lav diaz, but my criteria kasi forbid me to include anything i haven\\'t seen. and i haven\\'t seen any of his loooong films. i\\'ve only seen kriminal ng barrio concepcion years ago, which i liked, but won\\'t make this list anyway.\\nwhich is why i took note of the other critics. i was sure one of them would mention a lav diaz. and mike did! ^_^\\nanna Jun 12 2010 @ 12:02am Reply Report Abuse\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nI do think that lists like this, which are subjective as you say, should at least contain a brief bio of the author so we can see where you are coming from.\\ninteresting choices.

Solo estuve en \"Metro Manila\" que comprende 15 ciudades con 16 millones de habitantes, de una población total de 90 millones. No pude visitar las bellezas naturales en el norte y en el sur.\\nEn 1564 comenzó la colonización española que duró más de 300 años. Para que los frailes pudiesen identificar a los nativos, les dieron a escoger de una lista de nombres castellanos, que aún hoy perduran en los filipinos y en las calles; pero el castellano no logró sustituir a los dialectos indígenas. Manila floreció con los galeones que intercambiaban especies y mercancías chinas por el oro y plata mexicanos desde el puerto de Acapulco, pero el lucrativo intercambio desapareció a fines del siglo XVIII.\\nHoy casi nadie habla castellano y la influencia norteamericana es evidente\\nLa derrota española en la guerra hispano-cubana-americana provocó la pérdida de Cuba y las Filipinas en 1898. Durante la colonia de EE UU se implantó el inglés como lengua oficial enseñada en las escuelas. La ocupación norteamericana fue interrumpida por la invasión japonesa durante la II Guerra Mundial; en 1945, Manila fue destruida por el bombardeo de MacArthur frente a la fuerte resistencia nipona, causando 150.000 muertes de civiles. Los filipinos alcanzaron la soñada independencia en 1946.\\nHoy, casi nadie habla castellano, aunque la élite educada lo domina. La lengua principal es el tagalo (uno de los 165 dialectos existentes) con palabras españolas mezcladas que muchos filipinos creen que son parte del idioma vernáculo. El inglés es el segundo idioma, pero no todos lo hablan.\\nCasi todo lo relacionado con el comer es en castellano: mesa, silla, cubiertos, cuchillo, cuchara, tenedor, servilleta, merienda, vaso y botella. \"Platos\" típicos son el lechón, el adobo (de cerdo y pollo), la caldereta (de cabra) y el arroz caldo; se conservan tapas, puchero, leche, repollo, calabaza, harina (sin h) y jamón (con h), pan y mantequilla, carne, calamares, patatas, chocolate, limonada, azúcar (asúkal) y manzana, pera, uvas, papaya, melón y pomelo. Partes del hogar y los muebles continúan siendo llamados puerta, ventana, cama, sofá, aparador y escaparate. Los meses y los días de la semana son en castellano. Lo mismo ocurre en la ropa: pantalón, blusa, zapatos, camiseta, calzoncillo, sombrero, corbata y algunas palabras antiguas como chinelas y saya. También las familiares (padre y madre, abuelo y abuela, compadre y comadre), partes del cuerpo (cabeza, mano, brazo, lengua), oficios (carpintero, barbero, dentista, mecánico, basurero, juez, sastre, capitán), religión (iglesia, católico, Dios, Virgen María), negocios y servicios (botica, banco, hacienda, cementerio), animales (toro, caballo, pato) y flores (rosas, jazmín).\\nSe pide \"permiso\", una característica nacional es el \"amor propio\", los hombres tienen \"queridas\" pero no se usa \"queridos\", y hay \"guapos\" pero no \"guapas\" (a pesar de la aparente inequidad de género ha habido dos \"presidentas\"). Si uno está \"aburrido\" se va a una \"fiesta\", toma un \"café\" o una \"cerveza\" San Miguel y se despide con un \"adiós\".\\nEn la ciudad colonial (\"Intramuros\") perduran las murallas casi intactas, el Fuerte de Santiago que domina el río, la iglesia de San Agustín (la más antigua del país), el manuscrito del héroe nacional José Rizal El último adiós y una mansión reconstruida (Casa Manila) con bellísimos muebles antiguos de rejilla y estupenda cerámica española. El Museo Ayala tiene la mejor colección de oro que he visto, y el Museo del Pueblo Filipino exhibe los restos del galeón San Diego hundido en 1600 con un centenar de piezas de vajilla española.\\nFilipinas es una sociedad multiétnica, gran parte de la población es de descendencia china, y muchos son ricos. Los dos hoteles más lujosos son el Sangri-la y el Mandarín. Chinatown se extiende dos kilómetros, flanqueada por dos puertas chinas, y atiborrada de establecimientos de todo tipo. El enorme cementerio chino está lleno de \"apartamentos\", muchos de dos pisos, con aire acondicionado, cocina y baño. Para el día de difuntos los familiares van en la víspera, duermen en el piso superior, y al día siguiente preparan sus comidas y juegan al dominó o al majong frente a las tumbas de sus antepasados.\\nLa influencia norteamericana es evidente, la comida rápida (McDonald\\'s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Dunkin Donuts) ya está creando obesidad. El pasatiempo en Manila es el malling, pues el calor es abrumador y los malls tienen aire refrigerado. En Makati (el centro de negocios y de los grandes hoteles), el Greenbelt Mall se compone de cinco edificios inmensos, conectados por jardines tropicales, tiendas de marcas famosas y docenas de restaurantes.\\nEl tráfico en Manila es horroroso (peor que en Ciudad México). Una distancia corta que el domingo se recorre en taxi en 20 minutos, toma una hora y media durante días de trabajo. El vehículo más popular es el jeepney, un híbrido con frente de jeep y alargado atrás para dar cabida a 16 pasajeros. Hay un tren elevado, siempre abarrotado, y los buses grandes son escasos.\\nLos filipinos son muy amables y corteses. Un gesto común de bienvenida es llevarse la mano derecha al corazón o una pequeña reverencia.

He doesn\\'t need a bank account to retrieve the money.\\nMore than 5.5 million Filipinos now use their cellphones as virtual wallets, making the Philippines a leader among developing nations in providing financial transactions over mobile networks.\\nMobile banking services, which are also catching on in Kenya and South Africa, enable people who don\\'t have bank accounts to transfer money easily, quickly and safely. It\\'s spreading in the developing world because mobile phones are much more common than bank accounts.\\nThe system is particularly useful for the 8 million Filipinos — 10% of the country\\'s citizens — who work overseas and send money home, like Dennis\\' mother, Anna Tiangco. Previously, she sent money via a bank wire transfer, which costs $2.50 and takes two days to clear. The cellphone method costs only 13 cents, and is nearly instantaneous.\\n\"The good thing here is, wherever my children are, they can text me and I can send money immediately,\" she said by telephone from Hong Kong.\\nConsumers also can store limited amounts of money on their cellphones to buy things at stores that participate in the network — although this practice isn\\'t yet widespread in the Philippines.\\nMany more Filipinos use their phones to send airtime values called \"loads\" to prepaid subscribers. A parent, for example, can send a 60-peso load to replenish a child\\'s cellphone, charged to the parent\\'s account.\\nWhile Japanese and South Korean consumers have been using cellphones as virtual wallets for several years, those systems use a computer chip implanted in handset that allows people to buy things by waving the phone in front of a sensor. The Philippine system relies on simple text messages, which cost just 2 cents to send.\\nThe 41 million cellphone users in the Philippines are avid texters. The electronic connections have fostered a culture of quick greetings and forwarded jokes. Text messages also played a key role in mobilizing crowds that fueled the 2001 \"people power\" revolt that ousted President Joseph Estrada.\\nThe Philippines\\' two biggest mobile service providers, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications, have harnessed this penchant for text messaging to enable consumers to enter the world of e-commerce.\\nTapping into the cash flow from overseas Filipinos — who sent home $12.7 billion last year — Globe and Smart forged partnerships with foreign mobile providers and banks, as well as with local banks and merchants, to create a network that allows users to send and receive cash internationally.\\nWhen Anna Tiangco wants to send cash home, for example, she goes to a branch of her local provider, Hong Kong CSL Ltd., where a clerk credits her cellphone with the amount she has brought with her. She then transfers the money to family members via text messages — in essence instructing her providers to deduct money from her balance to the recipients she indicates.\\nIf a cellphone loaded with cash values is lost or stolen, the money can\\'t be tapped as long as the personal identification number isn\\'t revealed.

      "[0.0002478197509482816, 'What Is the National Flower of France?\\nBy Sue McCarty\\nThe iris, or fleur-de-lis, is the national flower of France.\\nThe iris is France\\'s national flower, and a stylized version of the flower is used for the country\\'s insignia and national emblem. The iris, or fleur-de-lis, has been used to represent French royalty since the 13th century and is said to signify perfection, light and life. In heraldic designs used by the French monarchy, the three petals also represented wisdom, faith and chivalry.\\nHistory\\nFleur-de-lis\\nThe iris flower was named for the Greek goddess Iris, who was a messenger on Mount Olympus. The flower was the symbol of idea and message in ancient Greece. Men planted an irises on the graves of their wives and lovers in ancient Greece as a tribute to the goddess, who led the souls of women to the Elysian fields.\\nThe iris was also adopted by the ruling class of the Roman Empire and eventually came to symbolize the predominantly Catholic French kingdom. While the French did not formally adopt the fleur-de-lis as a heraldic charge until the 12th century, as an emblem it has been found on coins and seals as early as the 10th century in France, England, Spain and other countries.\\nIdentification\\nThis brilliant iris is only one of more than 200 varieties.\\nThe primary features of the iris are the three petals. The central one stands straight, while the other two curve in either direction away from it. The three petals are often referred to as the standards, and the three outer sepals are called the falls.\\nThere are more than 200 varieties of iris flowers in a large range of colors, from pure white to a deep purple. The plant takes its name from the Greek word for rainbow.\\nReligious Significance\\nFleur-de-lis on a stained glass window in France.\\nDue to the iris\\' three petals, it has been considered representative of the Holy Trinity by the Roman Catholic Church, and is also the special symbol of the Virgin Mary. Because of this religious connotation, the iris has been a worldwide symbol of divine protection for centuries. According to heraldica.org, the flower acquired its strong religious connection through the influence of Saints Bernard and Jerome. Louis VII (1120-1180), one of France\\'s most pious kings, adopted the fleur-de-lis as a symbol of his Christian beliefs.\\nJoan of Arc carried a white banner that featured the fleur-de-lis to let the English know that God was blessing the French troops in their support of Charles VII\\'s successful bid for the French throne in 1429.\\nCultural Significance\\nFleur-de-lis on armor\\nIn the 12th century, either King Louis VI or King Louis VII (sources disagree, reports fleurdelis.com) became the first French king to display the stylized iris on his battle shield. English kings added the fleur-de-lis to their coats of arms to emphasize claims to the French throne, and knights added the symbol to their family insignias. These emblems were embroidered onto woven surcoats worn over a knight\\'s battle armor, coining the term \"coat of arms.\"\\nConsiderations and Legends\\nYellow irises\\nAccording to legend, King Clovis I followed a frightened doe across a river on his way to do battle with the king of Aquitania Alaric near Poitiers, France, in 507. Upon reaching the opposite bank, Clovis picked a wild yellow iris and put it on his helmet as a symbol of his future victory. Since then, kings of France have used the fleur de lis as their emblem, reports heraldica.org. King Louis XII (1460-1515) officially made the fleur-de-lis, or iris, the national French flower and symbol.\\nMisconceptions and Theories\\nYellow fleur-de-lis symbol\\nRecent, unconfirmed theories about the Holy Grail assert that the fleur-de-lis is a symbol of a mythical holy origin of France through a union between a descendant of Mary Magdelene and Jesus Christ and King Meroveus II, who was crowned at age 15 in 448. Despite arguments that the term fleurs-de-lis, also spelled fleur-de-lys, literally translates into \"flower of the lily,\" the Metropolitan Museum of Art claims it probably means the \"flower of Loys.\" This is how the long line of French kings named Louis referred to themselves up until Louis XIII in the mid-1600s. The historical use of a yellow fleur-de-lis as a symbol suggests that the connection is actually to the native wild yellow iris of legend and not the lily.\\nReferences\\n', 159]\n",

During 2016, the current account balance narrowed to its lowest level since the 2008 global financial crisis, but nevertheless mustered a surplus for a 14th consecutive year. International reserves remain at comfortable levels and the banking system is stable.\\nEfforts to improve tax administration and expenditures management have helped ease the Philippines\\' debt burden and tight fiscal situation. The Philippines received investment-grade credit ratings on its sovereign debt under the former AQUINO administration and has had little difficulty financing its budget deficits. However, weak absorptive capacity and implementation bottlenecks have prevented the government from maximizing its expenditure plans. Although it has improved, the low tax-to-GDP ratio remains a constraint to supporting increasingly higher spending levels and sustaining high and inclusive growth over the longer term.\\nEconomic growth has accelerated, averaging 6.1% per year from 2011 to 2016, compared with 4.5% under the MACAPAGAL-ARROYO government; and competitiveness rankings have improved. Although 2016 saw a record year for net foreign direct investment inflows, FDI to the Philippines has continued to lag regional peers, in part because the Philippine constitution and other laws restrict foreign ownership in important activities/sectors - such as land ownership and public utilities.\\nAlthough the economy grew at a faster pace under the AQUINO government, challenges to achieving more inclusive growth remain. Wealth is concentrated in the hands of the rich. The unemployment rate declined from 7.3% to 5.5% between 2010 and 2016 but the jobs are low paying and tedious. Underemployment hovers at around 18% to 19% of the employed. At least 40% of the employed work in the informal sector. Poverty afflicts more than a fifth of the population. More than 60% of the poor reside in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty (about 30%) is more severe - a challenge to raising rural farm and non-farm incomes. Continued efforts are needed to improve governance, the judicial system, the regulatory environment, the infrastructure, and the overall ease of doing business.\\n2016 saw the election of President Rodrigo DUTERTE, who has pledged to make inclusive growth and poverty reduction his top priority. DUTERTE believes that illegal drug use, crime and corruption are key barriers to economic development among the lower income class. This administration wants to reduce the poverty rate to 14% and graduate the economy to upper-middle income status by the end of President DUTERTE’s term in 2022. Key themes under the government’s Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda include continuity of macroeconomic policy, tax reform, higher investments in infrastructure and human capital development, and improving competitiveness and the overall ease of doing business. The administration has vowed to address spending bottlenecks and is pushing for congressional passage of a Comprehensive Tax Reform Program to help finance more aggressive infrastructure and social spending, starting in 2018. The government also supports relaxing restrictions on foreign ownership, except for land.\\n', 183]\n",

They are invitations for condemnation.\\nWe love them because they fulfill our hankering for order in the glut of things. We love them because they provide a measure, even if a crude one, for our taste. And we love them because they are a concentrated form of validation (\"Of course that should be in this list!\") and drama (\"How dare they include this and not that? Who does he think he is?\").\\nOf course, there will always be someone who will soon decry that something else important is missing. At best, they are something that can spark an impassioned debate among film buffs.\\nI have not seen all Filipino films, but I have seen my fair share of what are considered the best of what local cinema can offer.\\xa0\\xa0 In coming up with this list, I arrived at a haphazard criteria–that I will only select something that I have actually watched, and that something must have been able to engage me in a deeper way than most films I have seen.\\nBut first I got some help. Because I remember Cinemalaya\\'s Ed Cabagnot once telling me that he considers Eddie Romero\\'s Ganito Kami Noon Paano Kayo Ngayon as probably one of the best Filipino films ever made–simply because it tasked itself to answer the question: who or what is a Filipino? I wondered what other critics had to say about what is the best, and so I cornered a few of the country\\'s top film critics.\\nFrancis Cruz of the popular film blog Lessons From the School of Inattention , goes straight to his choices: \"Lav Diaz\\'s Batang West Side and Raya Martin\\'s Independencia. But if there\\'s one which I think is ripe for rediscovery, it would be Joey Gosiengfiao\\'s Bedspacers.\"\\nThe Philippine Daily Inquirer\\'s Rito Asilo agonized over it: \"This is a hard decision... But I choose Magnifico. Despite its tragic finale, Maryo J. de los Reyes\\' stirring 2003 drama nonetheless leaves strands of hope for the viewers.\"\\nWriter Luis Katigbak said that a few titles came to mind: \"There\\'s Luis Quirino\\'s short film Pasakalye, a darkly humorous little road trip of a film. There\\'s Quark Henares\\' Keka, which I love for the sheer irreverent fun it offers: dance number, death scenes, and all.

And that is something to cherish. In the end, I had to come up with my list–knowing full well my own criteria, and knowing that I wanted to touch on things not usually considered for lists like this, and that included a survey of all genres, as well as a consideration of short films, documentaries, animated films, independent films you don\\'t often see in the cineplex, and even the unabashedly commercial. And so here we go with my own take, whether I \"get it or not.\"\\n10. Kailangan Kita\\nDirected by Rory Quintos for Star Cinema, 2002\\nThis film proves that the unabashedly commercial–something created foremost as a money-making vehicle for movie stars–does not have to be ineptly made, even when it goes through the formula designed to induce Kleenex tears, set to the soundtrack of a popular love song. Quintos\\' take on the growing love affair between an arrogant U.S.-bred city boy (Aga Muhlach) and a snippy country lass (Claudine Barreto) is also a gorgeous paean to Bicolandia and its searingly hot cuisine. Its use of food and color to signal the growing romance between the two characters is at once breathtaking, hunger-inducing, and subtle. The ending, of course, is a let-down of corniness that sends shivers down our spine, reminding us at the end that this is still a Star Cinema film–but for a while there, we were enchanted.\\n9. Libingan\\nDirected by Ramon del Prado for Tuldok Animation, 2007\\nA little girl from the city goes home to the province with her mother, meets some bullies who steals her cellphone, and gets led to a nearby forest where she has the biggest encounter of all–with primeval beings that spring straight from our forgotten folklore. That this is all told in whimsical animation reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki is incredible. The Philippines is not quite known for its animated films–and what few that came, Gerry Garcia\\'s Isko: Adventures in Animasia (1995) and Robert Quilao\\'s Dayo (2008) did not exactly gain a huge following. Mr. Del Prado may be the future game changer for Filipino animation.\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n8. Ang Lihim ni Antonio\\nDirected by Joselito Altarejos for Viva Digital and Beyond the Box, 2008\\nThere\\'s no question about it: the subgenre of queer cinema is here to stay. They make too much money, which has led to quickie filmmaking cashing in on the trend, giving us films that are sometimes precious (Cris Pablo\\'s Boylets) or atrocious (Joel Lamangan\\'s Walang Kawala). Altarejo\\'s second queer film–a tragedy involving a boy, his mother, and his uncle–tapped into the well of queer unconscious and became perhaps the most popular film of its genre. Of course we\\'ve had groundbreaking–and perhaps even better made–gay films before. Contributions by Brocka (Ang Tatay Kong Nanay), Mel Chionglo (Sibak), Danny Zialcita (T-Bird at Ako), Gil Portes (Miguel/Michelle), Carlitos Siguion-Reyna (Ang Lalake sa Buhay ni Selya), and even the documentaries of Nick Deocampo (Oliver) easily spring to mind. But Antonio is a vivid experience because it is also both a story of growing up and coming out. That it is also sexually explicit adds to its notoriety. It ends with what many consider to be needless tragedy, but if you think about it, it may be the filmmaker giving us a necessary disapproving shake of the head, as if he\\'s saying, \"Sure, you find all these sexy now\"–and then pulls the rug right off our unsuspecting feet. Genius.\\n7. Bata Bata Paano Ka Ginawa?\\nDirected by Chito S. Rono for Star Cinema, 1998\\nI can\\'t believe that there was a once-upon-a-time when a Star Cinema imprimatur was a seal of \"fearless\" filmmaking. Remember Eskapo? Remember Ligaya ang Itawag Mo sa Akin (the Reyna Films-produced flick that it distributed)? Remember this brilliant adaptation of Lualhati Bautista\\'s acclaimed novel of a single mother coming to terms with the macho culture that surrounds her? Vilma Santos is a different revelation in this film–she is both dramatic and comic, and the result is an amazing thespian coup that elevates her. And that potty mouth!\\n6. Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros\\nDirected by Auraeus Solito for Cinemalaya, 2005\\nHow did Auraeus Solito do this? The film is like beautiful magic, where everything is totally unexpected, and yet also the inevitable sum of all its elements. The magic starts, of course, with Michiko Yamamoto\\'s brilliant story of a gay boy living in the slums who must contend with a lovable (but also macho, but…) family of small-time criminals and his incipient romantic fascination for a handsome policeman. Everything is just right in this heartwarming soup of a movie–but we respect it because it does not pull punches in becoming melodramatic. It is all of subtlety, including a heartbreaking ending (a long shot reminiscent of the ending of The Third Man).\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n5. Moral\\nDirected by Marilou Diaz-Abaya for Seven Stars Productions, 1982\\nI still remember the four women in Abaya\\'s feminist drama distinctly–the tomboyish and feisty Lorna Tolentino who is lost and is searching, sometimes in the wrong places, for a thing or a cause to believe in; the garish and ambitious singer Gina Alajar who cannot seem to accept the fact that she cannot sing; the beautiful and self-assured Sandy Andolong who must deal with the fact that her husband has left her for another man; and the put-upon housewife Anna Marin who must deal with an irresponsible husband and a nagging mother-in-law in the middle of the noise of too many children, with another one on the way. This film must have been electric when it was first released, and many years later, its message about the place of women in our world is still very much relevant. Years later, Abaya directed a sequel which replace the principal cast (save for Laurice Guillen as Lorna\\'s mother). It wasn\\'t half-bad, but the original was extraordinarily searing and intelligent–and cemented Abaya\\'s place in the pantheon of local filmmakers.\\n4. Mababangong Bangungot\\n\\xa0\\nDirected by Kidlat Tahimik, 1979\\nThis is the absolute father of all independent films in the country. Eric de Guia, now known as Kidlat Tahimik, casts himself as a man in love with Westernization–but a trip to Paris would soon change him. This is a powerful, if enigmatic, film. Cruz writes of it in his blog: \"It is Tahimik\\'s generosity, his humble simplification of the world\\'s complex worries, that carries Mababangong Bangungot from its low budget imaginings. Tahimik exoticizes his culture without necessarily exploiting it. He also exoticizes European cultures; and in a way, he dons the skin of a curious documentarian, only with more humor and a drawing charm.\"\\n3. Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang\\nDirected by Lino Brocka for Cinemanila, 1974\\nTo choose just one film from Brocka is always an exercise of foolishness. Most people would choose Bona or Maynila sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag or Insiang or Kapit sa Patalim–but Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang speaks to me more for some reason. Brocka famously set about to film this in his old hometown that once ostracized him, wowing them by bringing in big stars–and then slyly makes the town as the very backdrop for his searing tale of small-town hypocrisy. Talk about the ultimate revenge. In it, the young Christopher de Leon becomes our stand-in. He plays the innocent hero who must become his own man as he struggles with the scathing drama of ordinary corruption.\\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW\\n2. Kisapmata\\nDirected by Mike de Leon for Bancom Audiovision, 1981\\nHow do you choose just one title from the filmmography of perhaps the most technically proficient–and equally poetic–of Filipino filmmakers? De Leon is like our own version of Stanley Kubrick, in that he is a strange duck of a perfectionist–but manages to make films of totally different genres and make them into gems of cinema. Consider this: he has made tearjerker drama fests (Kung Managarap Ka\\'t Magising), musicals (Kakabakaba Ka Ba?), fraternity thrillers (Batch \\'82), socialist dramas (Sister Stella L.), horror films (Itim), and postmodern biographical films (Bayaning Third World)–and did them all with the panache of a master at the top of his form. With Kisapmata–his indictment of Filipino machismo in this dark (and true life) tale of a policeman father and his murderous hold on his daughter, his wife, and his frustrated son-in-law–he orchestrates all of cinema\\'s techniques (the deliberate editing, the claustrophobic set design, the paranoid cinematography, and the subtle but gripping acting turns by Vic Silayan, Charo Santos, Charito Solis, and Jay Ilagan) to immerse us fully into the dark melodrama. We come away from the film shattered–but enriched.\\n1. Oro Plata Mata\\nDirected by Peque Gallaga for Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, 1982\\nThis is not an unconventional choice. It is almost totally expected. But every time somebody asks me what is my favorite Filipino film, I may hem and haw about the ultimate choice, but in the end this is my answer: Gallaga\\'s Negrense epic of war and loss of innocence. The Philippine Daily Inquirer\\'s Gibbs Cadiz agrees with me: \"I like how it brought a dead era back to life. The final third of the film was a mess, but everything before that was glorious. It reminds me of Visconti\\'s The Leopard–shabbier but the same spirit.\" And Rito Asilo also says: \"Oro Plata Mata eloquently vivifies the destructive reach of war and invasion. Its scope is epic, but it manages to keep its tone and temperament intimate and undeniably Pinoy. It\\'s as relevant now as it was in 1982. But it\\'s downhill from there for Gallaga, whose most recent films (2005\\'s Pinoy Blonde and 2009\\'s Agaton and Mindy) were to say atrocious.\"\\nRunners-up: Trip (directed by Juan Pula a.k.a.

SWITCH NOW to the new, more interactive format.\\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributed to the generally free practice of religion.\\nThe government generally respected religious freedom in practice. There was no change in the status of respect for religious freedom by the government during the reporting period. The armed insurgent Muslim group Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) continued to seek greater autonomy. The government and MILF have successfully maintained a ceasefire instituted in July 2009 and have since engaged in peace talks. There was some ethnic, religious, and cultural discrimination against members of the Muslim minority by members of the Christian majority. This, combined with economic disparities, contributed to persistent conflict in certain provinces in the southern part of the country.\\nThe U.S. government discusses religious freedom with the government as part of its overall policy to promote human rights. The embassy actively encouraged the peace process between the government and MILF and maintained active outreach with religious leaders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to engage them in interfaith activities.\\nSection I. Religious Demography\\nThe country has an area of 115,831 square miles and a population of 97.98 million.\\nAccording to the National Statistics Office, approximately 93 percent of the population is Christian. Roman Catholics, the largest religious group, constitute 80 to 85 percent of the total population.\\nIslam is the largest minority religion, and Muslims constitute between 5 and 9 percent of the total population. Most Filipino Muslims are members of various ethnic minority groups. They reside principally on Mindanao and nearby islands. Although most belong to the Sunni branch of Islam, a small number of Shi\\'a Muslims live in the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Zamboanga del Sur in Mindanao. An increasing number of Filipino Muslims have migrated to the urban centers of Manila and Cebu.\\nGroups that together constitute less than 5 percent of the population include Seventh-day Adventists, United Church of Christ, United Methodist, the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, Assemblies of God, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and Philippine (Southern) Baptists. Domestically established denominations include the Philippine Independent Church (Aglipayan); the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ); the Members Church of God International; and The Kingdom of Jesus Christ, the Name Above Every Name. Iglesia ni Cristo is the largest indigenous Christian denomination, with approximately 5.6 million members. Christianity is the majority religion among indigenous peoples. Between 12 million and 16 million indigenous persons adhere to Catholicism or Protestantism, often incorporating elements of traditional indigenous belief systems.\\nConversion from Christianity to Islam is most typical among overseas Filipinos while they are living and working in Islamic countries. Many of these converts remain Muslim upon their return to the country and are known collectively as \"Balik Islam\" (return to Islam).\\nSection II. Status of Government Respect for Religious Freedom\\nLegal/Policy Framework\\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributed to the generally free practice of religion. There is no state religion, and the constitution provides for the separation of church and state.\\nThe law required organized religions to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Bureau of Internal Revenue to establish tax-exempt status. There was no penalty for failing to register, and some groups do not. There were no reports of discrimination in the registration system during the reporting period.\\nOn February 18, 2010, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Republic Act 9997, which replaced the Office of Muslim Affairs with the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF). The cabinet-level commission worked to promote the rights of Muslim Filipinos at both the national and local level and supported the implementation of economic, educational, cultural, and infrastructure programs for Muslim Filipino communities. NCMF’s Bureau of Pilgrimage and Endowment will administer the Hajj (annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca). It is also responsible for the administration of awqaf (endowment properties) and institutions and the conduct of activities for the establishment and maintenance of Haji towns, Islamic centers, and other projects. The Presidential Assistant for Muslim Affairs helps coordinate relations with countries that have large Islamic populations and that contributed to Mindanao\\'s economic development and the peace process.\\nThe government permitted religious instruction in public schools with parents’ written consent, provided there was no cost to the government. Based on a traditional policy of promoting moral education, local public schools gave religious groups the opportunity to teach moral values during school hours. Attendance was not mandatory, and the various groups shared classroom space. The government also allowed interested groups to distribute religious literature in public schools. By law public schools must ensure that the religious rights of students are protected. Muslim students are allowed to wear hijab (head coverings), and Muslim girls are not required to wear shorts during physical education classes. In many parts of Mindanao, Muslim students routinely attended Catholic schools from elementary to university level; these students were not required to receive religious instruction.\\nApproximately 14 percent of the Mindanao student population attended madaris (Islamic schools). Government officials estimated there were more than 1,000 madaris operating throughout the country. Of these more than half were located in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). A total of 588 madaris were registered with the NCMF, while 40 were registered with the Department of Education (DepEd). Registration with the NCMF or the DepEd is optional for madaris but, if pursued, can lead to financial assistance from the government. Most madaris did not meet the department\\'s accreditation standards. The DepEd manages financial assistance to the madaris system from local and international sources, and the DepEd\\'s Bureau of Madrasah Education oversees education activities in the ARMM.\\nThe government continued to implement its unified curriculum, designed to integrate madaris into the national education system. In addition to the 40 madaris registered with the DepEd, five madaris in Mindanao were in the process of obtaining operation permits from DepEd at the end of the reporting period. DepEd ordered public elementary schools that had at least 15 Muslim students to begin offering Arabic language instruction and classes on Islamic values, but funding shortfalls and a lack of qualified Arabic teachers limited the reach of this initiative. During the 2009-10 school year, DepEd provided Arabic language instruction and Islamic values education, including textbooks on these subjects, to Muslim students in selected public elementary schools. In August 2009, DepEd began an assistance program with seed funding of $398,992 (Philippine Peso 19 million) to private madaris that have already adopted the standard curriculum on madrasah.\\nThe government\\'s National Ecumenical Consultative Committee (NECCOM) fostered interfaith dialogue among major religious groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, Muslim groups, Iglesia ni Cristo, Aglipayan, and Protestant denominations. Smaller Protestant denominations are represented in the NECCOM through the National Council of Churches of the Philippines and the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches, two large networks of Protestant churches and mission groups. NECCOM members met periodically with the President to discuss social and political issues.\\nThe government observes the following religious holidays as national holidays: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter, All Saints\\' Day, Christmas Day, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha.\\nRestrictions on Religious Freedom\\nThe government generally respected religious freedom in practice. There was no change in the status of respect for religious freedom by the government during the reporting period. There were no reports of religious detainees or prisoners in the country. The government does not ban or discourage specific religious groups or religious factions. However, Muslims, who are concentrated in some of the most impoverished provinces, complained that the government had not made sufficient efforts to promote their economic development. Some Muslim religious leaders asserted that Muslims suffered from economic discrimination. The government\\'s campaign against terrorist groups led some human rights NGOs to accuse the police and military of acting with bias in their treatment of Muslims.\\nThe Code of Muslim Personal Laws recognizes Shari\\'a (Islamic law) as part of national law; however, it does not apply in criminal matters, and it applies only to Muslims. Some ulama (Muslim community leaders) argued that the government should allow Islamic courts to extend their jurisdiction to criminal law cases, and some supported the MILF\\'s goal of forming an autonomous region governed in accordance with Islamic law. As in other parts of the judicial system, the Shari\\'a courts suffered from a large number of unfilled positions. All five Shari\\'a district court judgeships and 39 percent of circuit court judgeships remained vacant. Aside from budget restrictions, judicial positions on the Shari\\'a courts were particularly difficult to fill because applicants must be members of both the Shari\\'a bar and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.\\nForced Religious Conversions\\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion.\\nAbuses by Rebel or Foreign Forces or Terrorist Organizations\\nThe government attributed several attacks in the first half of 2009 to MILF separatist rebels who continued to seek political autonomy in Mindanao during the reporting period. In August 2008 after the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on the signing of a government-MILF territorial agreement, an agreement later declared unconstitutional, MILF attacks and subsequent clashes with government troops resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Christian and Muslim residents and the internal displacement in central Mindanao of hundreds of thousands of civilians. The government and MILF instituted a ceasefire in July 2009 and have since engaged in peace talks.\\nDuring the reporting period, the government also attributed a series of attacks, kidnappings, and killings to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), other Islamic militants, and the New People\\'s Army. Religious affiliation was not seen as a relevant factor in these attacks.\\nSporadic bombings of places of worship also occurred during the reporting period. On July 5, 2009, a bomb outside the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Cotabato City killed six and wounded 30 others as they were leaving worship service. On July 7 two more bombs exploded near a cathedral in Jolo City, killing two people and injuring 50. On January 11, 2010, a grenade exploded outside a cathedral in Jolo, Sulu. There were no reported injuries, but the cathedral was slightly damaged. On May 9, 2010, the day prior to national elections, two persons were killed and 12 wounded when a hand grenade was thrown inside a mosque in Pikit, North Cotabato. The Philippine National Police detained suspects affiliated with the ASG in connection with these bombings.\\nImprovements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom\\nMany Muslims welcomed the enactment of the Republic Act 9997, which created and funded the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF). The new commission will expand activities supporting Islamic religious practices and promote the implementation of economic, educational, cultural, and infrastructure programs for Muslim Filipino communities. The new law also mandated the commission\\'s engagement in the following activities: peace process, development of domestic trade and commerce among the members of Muslim Filipino communities, promotion of the halal (a food preparation method in Islamic dietary law), and undertaking studies and establishing ethnographic research centers and museums on Muslim cultures and institutions.\\nThe government promoted interfaith dialogue to build mutual trust and respect among various religious and cultural groups. The Council on Interfaith Initiatives continued to strengthen the government\\'s existing institutional arrangements for interfaith activities by coordinating interfaith programs and initiatives with all government agencies, local government units, and NGO partners. The council receives, approves, and prioritizes programs and project proposals designed to achieve peace and development through interfaith dialogue and cooperation.\\nFrom March 16 to 18, 2010, the country hosted the Special Non-aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development (SNAMMM). During the meeting the 118 member representatives of the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) adopted a declaration that called for respect of cultural and religious diversity, promotion of tolerance and interfaith dialogues, and related confidence-building measures among members. The government\\'s Council on Values Formation also spearheaded a parallel meeting on interfaith dialogue on March 16, 2010. During the meeting 70 delegates from various civil society and religious organizations urged the NAM member countries to collaborate in resolving issues that would promote lasting peace and development.\\nSection III. Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom\\nHistorically, Muslims have been alienated socially from the Christian majority, and some ethnic and cultural discrimination against Muslims have been recorded. Young Muslim professionals reported that some employers stereotyped Muslims as being less educated. Some Muslims reported that they had difficulty renting rooms in boarding houses or being hired for retail work if they used their real names or wore distinctive Muslim dress. Therefore, many resorted to adopting Christian pseudonyms and wearing Western clothing.\\nOver the past 60 years, efforts by the dominant Christian population to resettle in traditionally Muslim areas such as Mindanao have fostered resentment among many Muslim residents. Many Muslims viewed Christian proselytizing as another form of resettlement, with the intention of depriving Muslims of their homeland and cultural identity, including their religion.\\nDespite these circumstances, amicable ties among religious communities were common, and many participated in interdenominational efforts to alleviate poverty. The Peacemakers\\' Circle Foundation, a loose coalition of various religious and faith-based groups, continued to focus on building and strengthening interfaith relations through dialogues between Muslims and Christians in selected communities. The Bishops-Ulama Conference in Mindanao continued to bring together Catholic bishops and members of the Ulama League of the Philippines from Mindanao and hold dialogues on addressing local issues of peace and order and intercultural solidarity. Other interfaith groups also promoted peace between persons of different faiths. Leadership of human rights groups, trade union confederations, and industry associations typically represents many religious persuasions.\\nSection IV. U.S. Government Policy\\nThe U.S. government discusses religious freedom with the government as part of its overall policy to promote human rights. U.S. embassy officers regularly met with representatives of all major religious groups to discuss these problems and concerns. In addition the U.S. government actively supported the government\\'s peace process with Muslim insurgents in Mindanao, which has the potential to contribute to peace and a better climate for interfaith cooperation.\\nThe embassy also maintained active outreach with NGOs. The embassy hosted meetings of political and opinion leaders from the Muslim community to discuss the U.S. role in Mindanao. The embassy continued to conduct a wide range of programming to promote interfaith dialogue and peace and to highlight these issues with populations in and around Manila, as well as across Mindanao. In December 2009 the embassy coordinated the visit to the country of the U.S. Special Representative to Muslim Communities, Farah Pandith. The visit included mission briefings, a forum with university students, meetings with NGOs working on Muslim and peace-related issues, interviews with the traditional and Web-based media, meetings with religious leaders and women leaders, and a visit to a local Muslim community to meet government and community leaders.\\nIn February 2009 American Imam Talal Y. Eid, a member of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, visited the country to promote interfaith dialogue and cooperation among interethnic audiences, including women’s groups and youth in Metro Manila and Mindanao.\\nThe estimated total development support of the U.S. government to Mindanao for fiscal year 2009 is $69 million, which composes nearly 60 percent of U.S. government development assistance to the Philippines. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs contributed to promoting peace and fostering an environment for greater religious tolerance. USAID trained more than 470 peace advocates, mostly Muslims from areas in Mindanao affected by conflict and Muslim separatist activities. Almost 30 percent of the trained peace advocates were Muslim women. USAID funds were also used to develop an Islamic-based handbook on conflict resolution for community leaders and to institutionalize community-level alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In the environment sector, USAID supported a special initiative called Al Khalifa (The Steward), an environmental sourcebook based on the Islamic perspective on managing the environment.\\nUSAID programs also provided support to former MILF combatants to encourage their shift from fighting to productive farming and supported the construction of community-based infrastructure projects. With U.S. Department of Defense 1207 funding, USAID completed the Tawi Tawi airport runway improvement project in FY 2009, which will facilitate increased passenger and cargo traffic, thereby supporting economic development in the conflict-affected areas in the Sulu Archipelago. Improvements in transportation infrastructure in the conflict-affected areas are expected to support long-term economic progress and help consolidate peace.\\nUSAID also supported several internship programs for Muslim students. Fourteen Muslim students completed intensive hands-on training in business administration and enterprise development with multi-national companies. Twenty-five young Muslim student leaders were sponsored as interns of the largely Christian-dominated Philippine House of Representatives. The legislative internship program helped policymakers develop a more intimate understanding of Mindanao\\'s Muslim cultures, while simultaneously fostering an appreciation among the interns for the policy-making and legislative processes.\\nIn May and June of 2009, USAID and the embassy\\'s public affairs section coorganized the Cultures Across Mindanao program, which included the participation of more than 200 in- and out-of-school youth from different faiths and ethnic roots across Mindanao. The youth were given training as peace advocates in five-day camps and were provided an interfaith environment where they could interact with one another. USAID assisted 21 madaris last year to adopt the Department of Education’s Standard Madrasah Curriculum and get accreditation and support from the national government. The owners and administrators of the selected madaris were given capacity-building training, such as planning, financial management, school governance, and resource mobilization.\\nWith increased staffing for expanded outreach in Mindanao, the Embassy′s Public Affairs Section funded programs in Mindanao that included high school education, arts preservation, community policing, and a summer youth camp. The Embassy partnered with a local NGO to implement a two-year English Microscholarship Program that initially provided after-school English instruction for three public high schools in July 2009 and expanded to some public high schools in Mindanao in September 2009.\\nIn March 2010 the Embassy partnered with a local university in Jolo to launch a revitalization program for Sulu arts and culture. This activity was designed to allow the inhabitants to engage in productive cultural activities that preserve and protect the indigenous culture. The Embassy also partnered with the National Arts Center to sponsor a 12-day summer camp of creative interaction in modern-urban dance for 50 young dancers from the Sulu Archipelago and Luzon. The participants utilized dance as an art form to foster dialogue about art and other forms of human interaction as tools in conflict resolution, leadership skills building, and building bridges across and within cultures, including both Philippine-U.S. and internal Philippine dialogues.\\nIn This Section:\\n', 210]\n",
      "[0.00020102830797755664, 'Filipino\\nOrientation\\nIdentification. The Republic of the Philippines was named the Filipinas to honor King       Philip the Second of Spain in 1543. The Philippine Islands was the name       used before independence.\\nLocation and Geography. The Republic of the Philippines, a nation of 7,107 islands with a total       area of 111,830 square miles (307,055 square kilometers), is located on       the Pacific Rim of Southeast Asia. Two thousand of its islands are       inhabited. Luzon, the largest island with one-third of the land and half       the population, is in the north. Mindanao, the second largest island, is       in the south. The Philippines are 1,152 miles (1,854 kilometers) long from       north to south. The width is 688 miles (1,107 kilometers). There are no       land boundaries; the country is bordered on the west by the South China       Sea, on the east by the Philippine Sea, on the south by the Celebes Sea,       and on the north by the Luzon Strait, which separates the country from its       nearest neighbor, Taiwan. The closest nations to the south are Malaysia       and Indonesia. Vietnam and China are the nearest neighbors on the mainland       of Asia.\\nThe islands are volcanic in origin. Mount Mayon in southern Luzon erupted       in 2000. Mount Pinatubo in central Luzon erupted in 1991 and 1992. Both       eruptions caused destruction of villages and farms and displaced thousands       of people from their tribal homelands. Because the country is volcanic,       the small islands have a mountainous center with coastal plains. Luzon has       a broad central valley in the northern provinces along the Cagayan River       and plains in the midlands near Manila, the capital. Mindanao and Panay       also have central plains. Northern Luzon has two major mountain ranges:       the Sierra Madres on the eastern coast and the Cordilleras in the center.       The highest peak is Mount Apo in Mindanao at 9,689 feet (2,954 meters).\\nThe weather is hot because of the country\\'s closeness to the       equator. The temperatures are constant except during typhoons. The dry       season is from January to June; the wet season with monsoon rains is from       July to December. Temperatures are cooler in November through January,       dropping below 30 degrees Celsius (85 degrees Fahrenheit). The summer       months of April and May have temperatures in excess of 39 degrees Celsius       (100 degrees Fahrenheit). Typhoons occur from June through November.\\nDemography. The estimated population in July 2000 was eighty-one million. The average       life expectancy is sixty-seven years. Four percent of the population is       over age sixty-five. The most populous area is Metropolitan Manila, where       eight million to ten million people live.\\nLinguistic Affiliation. The official languages are Filipino, which is based on Tagalog with words       from other native languages, and English. Since only 55 percent of       residents speak Filipino fluently, English is used in colleges,       universities, the courts, and the government. The country\\'s seventy       to eighty dialects are derived from Malay languages. Three dialects are of       national importance: Cebuano in the southern islands, Ilocano in the       north, and Tagalog, the language of the National Capital Region. When       Tagalog was chosen as the basis for a national language, Cebuanos refused       to use Filipino. \"Taglish,\" a mixture of Filipino and       English, is becoming a standard language. Filipinos are proud that their       country has the third largest number of English speakers in the world.       Filipino English includes many Australian and British terms. It is a       formal language that includes words no longer commonly used in American       English. Spanish was taught as a compulsory language until 1968 but is       seldom used today. Spanish numbers and some Spanish words are included in       the dialects.\\nPhilippines\\nThe dependence on English causes concern, but since Filipino does not have       words for scientific or technological terms, English is likely to remain       in common use.\\nSymbolism. National symbols have been emphasized since independence to create a       sense of nationhood. The Philippine eagle, the second largest eagle in the       world, is the national bird. Doctor Jose Rizal is the national hero. Rizal       streets and statues of Rizal are found in most towns and cities. Several       municipalities are named for Rizal. The most prominent symbol is the flag,       which has a blue horizontal band, a red horizontal band, and a white       field. The flag is flown with the blue band at the top in times of peace       and the red band at the top in times of war. Flag ceremonies take place       once a week at all governmental offices. Schools have a flag ceremony each       morning. All traffic stops while the flag is being honored. The national       anthem is sung, a national pledge is recited in Filipino, and the provincial hymn is sung.\\nHistory and Ethnic Relations\\nEmergence of the Nation. Early inhabitants are believed to have reached the area over land bridges       connecting the islands to Malaysia and China. The first people were the       Negritos, who arrived twenty-five thousand years ago. Later immigrants       came from Indonesia. After the land bridges disappeared, immigrants from       Indo-China brought copper and bronze and built the rice terraces at Benaue       in northern Luzon. The next wave came from Malaysia and is credited with       developing agriculture and introducing carabao (water buffalo) as draft animals. Trade with China began in the first       century\\nC.E.\\nFilipino ores and wood were traded for finished products.\\nIn 1380, the \"Propagation of Islam\" began in the Sulu       Islands and Mindanao, where Islam remains the major religion. The Muslim       influence had spread as far north as Luzon when Ferdinand Magellan arrived       in 1521 to claim the archipelago for Spain. Magellan was killed soon       afterward when a local chief, Lapu-Lapu, refused to accept Spanish rule       and Christianity. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi landed in the Philippines in       1564 and consolidated Spanish power, designating Manila as the capital in       1572. Roman Catholic religious orders began Christianizing the populace,       but the Sulu Islands and Mindanao remained Muslim. The Spanish governed       those areas through a treaty with the sultan of Mindanao. The Spanish did       not attempt to conquer the deep mountain regions of far northern Luzon.\\nThe occupation by Spain and the unifying factor of Catholicism were the       first steps in creating a national identity. Filipinos became interested       in attaining independence in the middle of the nineteenth century. In the       1890\\'s, the novels of José Rizal, his exile to a remote       island, and his execution by the Spaniards created a national martyr and a       rallying         point for groups seeking independence. Armed attacks and propaganda       increased, with an initial success that waned as Spanish reinforcements       arrived. The Spanish-American War of 1898 and the defeat of the Spanish       fleet in Manila Bay led the Filipino leader Emilio Aguinaldo to declare       independence from Spain. The United States paid twenty million dollars to       the Spanish for the Philippines under the Treaty of Paris. Aguinaldo did       not accept United States occupation and fought until the Filipino forces       were defeated. In 1902, the Philippines became an American territory, with       the future president William Howard Taft serving as the first territorial       governor. Over the next two decades, American attitudes toward the       Philippines changed and the islands were given commonwealth status in       1933. Independence was promised after twelve years, with the United States       retaining rights to military bases.\\nThe Japanese invaded the Philippines early in 1942 and ruled until 1944.       Filipino forces continued to wage guerrilla warfare. The return of U.S.       forces ended the Japanese occupation. After the war, plans for       independence were resumed. The Republic of the Philippines became an       independent nation on 4 July 1946.\\nThe new nation had to recover economically from the destruction caused by       World War II. Peasant groups wanted the huge land holdings encouraged by       the Spanish and Americans broken apart. In 1955, Congress passed the first       law to distribute land to farmers.\\nFerdinand Marcos governed from 1965 to 1986, which was the longest period       for one president. From 1972 to 1981, he ruled by martial law. Marcos was       reelected in 1982, but a strong opposition movement emerged. When the       leader of the opposition, Benigno Aquino, was murdered after his return       from exile in the United States, his wife, Corazon Aquino, entered the       presidential race in 1986. Marcos claimed victory but was accused of       fraud. That accusation and the withdrawal of United States support for       Marcos led to \"People Power,\" a movement in which the       residents of Manila protested the Marcos regime. The Filipino military       supported Aquino, who was declared president, and the Marcos family went       into exile in Hawaii.\\nThe Aquino years saw the passage of a new constitution with term limits       and the withdrawal of U.S. military forces in 1991, when the government       did not grant a new lease for United States use of military bases.\\nFidel Ramos, the first Protestant president, served from 1991 to 1998.       Major problems included a fall in the value of the peso and the demands of       Muslim groups in Mindanao for self-determination and/or independence. The       government offered self-governance and additional funds, and the movement       quieted.\\nJoseph \"Erap\" Estrada was elected for one six-year term in       1999. The demands of the Muslim rebels escalated, culminating with the       kidnaping of twenty-nine people by the Abu Sayyaf group in April 2000.       Late in the year 2000, impeachment proceedings were brought against       Estrada, who was charged with financial corruption.\\nNational Identity. Filipinos had little sense of national identity until the revolutionary       period of the nineteenth century. The word \"Filipino\" did       not refer to native people until the mid-nineteenth century. Before that       period, the treatment of the islands as a single governmental unit by       Spain and the conversion of the population to Catholicism were the       unifying factors. As a desire for independence grew, a national flag was       created, national heroes emerged, and a national anthem was written. A       national language was designated in 1936. National costumes were       established. The sense of a national identity is fragile, with true       allegiance given to a kin group, a province, or a municipality.\\nEthnic Relations. Ninety-five percent of the population is of Malay ancestry. The other       identifiable group is of Chinese ancestry. Sino-Filipinos are envied for       their success in business. They have maintained their own schools, which       stress Chinese traditions.\\nSeventy to eighty language groups separate people along tribal lines.       Approximately two million residents are designated as cultural minority       groups protected by the government. The majority of those sixty ethnic       groups live in the mountains of northern Luzon. People whose skin is       darker are considered less capable, intelligent, and beautiful.       Descendants of the Negritos tribe are regarded as inferior.\\nUrbanism, Architecture, and the Use of Space\\nThe architecture of the islands shows Spanish influence. Spanish brick       churches built during the colonial era dominate the towns. The churches       are large and different from traditional construction. It is difficult to       imagine how the indigenous population in the seventeenth century was able       to build them.\\nFilipino families enjoy close kin bonds, and extended families             living together are the norm.\\nSeaports and government centers had a larger proportion of Spanish       buildings with wide verandas and tiled roofs. Towns destroyed during the       liberation campaign in World War II, especially in central and northern       Luzon, were rebuilt using wood. Areas of Manila destroyed during World War       II have been restored to their historical Spanish appearance. Newer       buildings in Manila range from standard multistory offices to       Western-style gated housing areas for the affluent, to tenements and       shacks.\\nTraditional houses in rural areas are nipa huts constructed of bamboo and roofed with leaves from palm trees or       corrugated metal. Cinder blocks are the most commonly building material       used. The blocks are plastered and painted on the inside and outside when       funds permit. Plasterers add decorative touches to the exterior. Older       houses have a \"dirty\" open-air kitchen for food preparation.       Newer, larger houses designate a room as a dirty kitchen in contrast to       the \"clean\" kitchen, which has an eating area where utensils       are stored. Enclosed kitchens provide a roof over the cook and keep dogs       and chickens from wandering into the cooking area. The roof is pitched so       that rain will run off. Middle-class houses and commercial buildings have       tiled roofs.\\nFood and Economy\\nFood in Daily Life. Filipinos do not consider it a meal if rice is not served. Plain steamed       rice is the basis of the diet. Three crops a year are harvested to provide       enough rice for the population, and the government keeps surpluses stored       for times of drought. Salt water and freshwater of fish and shellfish are       eaten daily, served either fresh or salted. Fish, chicken and pork are       usually fried, although people are becoming more health-conscious and       often choose alternative methods of cooking. Garlic is added to food       because it is considered healthful. Filipino food is not spicy. All food       is cooked on gas burners or wood or charcoal fires and is allowed to get       cold before it is eaten. Rice is cooked first, since it takes longer. When       it is ready, rice will be placed on the table while the next items of the       meal are prepared and served.\\nTable knives are not used. Forks and spoons are used for dining. The food       is eaten from a spoon. The traditional method of placing food on a banana       leaf and eating with one\\'s hands is also used throughout the       country. It is acceptable to eat food with one\\'s hands at       restaurants as well as in the home.\\nBreakfast is served at 6\\nA.M.\\nand consists of food left over from the night before. It is not reheated.       Eggs and sausage are served on special occasions.         Small buns called pan de sol may be purchased from vendors early in the morning.\\nAt midmorning and in the afternoon, people eat merienda. Since Filipinos are fond of sweet foods, a mixture of instant coffee,       evaporated milk, and sugar may be served. Coca-Cola is very popular. Sweet       rolls, doughnuts, or a noodle dish may be available. Lunch is a light meal       with rice and one other dish, often a fish or meat stew. Fish, pork, or       chicken is served at dinner with a soup made of lentils or vegetables.       Fatty pork is a favorite. Portions of small cubes of browned pork fat are       considered a special dish.\\nFruits are abundant all year. Several kinds of banana are eaten, including       red and green varieties. Mangoes, the national fruit, are sweet and juicy.       A fruit salad with condensed milk and coconut milk is very popular on       special occasions.\\nVegetables are included as part of a soup or stew. Green beans and       potatoes are commonly eaten foods. The leaves of camote, a sweet potato, are used as a salad and soup ingredient. Ube, a bland bright purple potato, is used as a colorful ingredient in cakes       and ice cream. Halo-halo, which means \"mixture,\" is a popular dessert that consists       of layers of corn kernels, ice cream, small gelatin pieces, cornflakes and       shaved ice. Patis, a very salty fish sauce, is placed on the table to be added to any of the       dishes.\\nFast food has become part of the culture, with national and international       chains in many towns. All meals at fast-food restaurant include rice,       although French fries also tend to be on the menu. Banana ketchup is       preferred, although the international chains serve tomato ketchup. A       national chain, Jollibee, has entered the U.S. market with a restaurant in       California, where many Filipino immigrants live. The company plans to       expand to other cities with Filipino populations.\\nFood Customs at Ceremonial Occasions. Léchon, a suckling pig that has been roasted until the skin forms a hard brown       crust, is served at important occasions. The inside is very fatty. Strips       of the skin with attached fat are considered the best pieces. The       importance of the host and the occasion are measured by the amount of léchon. served. Blood drained from the pig is used to make dinuguan\\nSticky rice prepared with coconut milk and sugarcane syrup is wrapped in       banana leaves. Glutinous rice is grown especially for use in this       traditional dessert.\\nGin and beer are available for men and are accompanied by balut, a duck egg with an embryo. Dog meat is a delicacy throughout the country.       It is now illegal to sell dog meat at markets because cases of rabies have       occurred when the brains were eaten.\\nBasic Economy. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing are the occupations of 40 percent of       the thirty million people who are employed. Light manufacturing,       construction, mining and the service industries provide the remainder of       employment opportunities. The unemployment rate is over 9 percent. Fifty       percent of the population lives below the poverty line. The Asian       financial crisis resulted in a lack of jobs, and the drought period of the       El Niño weather cycle has reduced the number of agricultural       positions. It is not uncommon for people to \"volunteer\" as       workers in the health care field in hopes of being chosen to work when a       position becomes available. People work seven days a week and take       additional jobs to maintain or improve their lifestyle or pay for a       child\\'s education. Eight hundred thousand citizens work overseas,       primarily as merchant seamen, health care, household, or factory workers       in Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Over Seas Workers (OSWs) have a       governmental agency that looks after their interests. Laws govern hours of       work, insurance coverage, and vacation time, but workers may be exploited       and mistreated. Recruitment centers are found in all large municipalities.       OSWs send $7 billion home each year, providing 4 percent of the gross       domestic product.\\nLand Tenure and Property. Nineteen percent of the land is arable and 46 percent consists of forests       and woodlands. Deforestation by legal and illegal loggers with no tree       replacement has reduced the number of trees. Large amounts of arable land       remain in the hand of absentee landowners who were given land grants       during the Spanish colonial period. Although land reform legislation has       been passed, loopholes allow owners to retain possession. Those       responsible for enacting and enforcing the legislation often come from the       same families that own the land. Peasant groups such as the HUKs       (People\\'s Liberation Army, or Hukbong Magpapayang Bayan ) in the 1950s and the NPA (New People\\'s Army) at the present time       have resorted to guerrilla tactics to provide land for the poor. There is       an ongoing demand to clear forests to provide farmland. The clearing       technique is slash and burn. Environmentalists are concerned because       timber is destroyed at random, eliminating the homes of endangered species       of plants and animals.\\nCommercial Activities. The local market is a key factor in retail trade. Larger municipalities       have daily markets, while smaller communities have\\nPhilippine children playing on Guimaras Island. Young children             typically live with grandparents or aunts for extended periods.\\nmarkets once or twice a week. Trade at the market is conducted in a       barter system. Suki relationships are established at the marketplace so that the buyer       returns to the same vendor. Markets are divided into \"dry\"       markets where clothing and household items are sold and       \"wet\" markets where food is sold. Sari-sari establishments are small neighborhood stores. They are convenient since       they have packaged products and are in the neighborhood, but no fresh       foods are available there. In larger towns, supermarkets with fixed prices       are adjacent to the market. Electronic equipment, furniture, and clothing       have fixed prices and are sold in stores or at kiosks. Shopping malls are       found in most provincial capitals. Malls with Western shops are found       throughout metropolitan Manila.\\nMajor Industries. Metropolitan Manila is the primary manufacturing area, with 10 percent of       the population living there. Manila and the adjacent ports are the best       equipped to ship manufactured goods. Manufacturing plants produce       electrical and electronic components, chemicals, clothing, and machinery.       The provinces produce processed foods, textiles, tobacco products, and       construction materials. Manufacturing in the home continues to be common       in remote areas.\\nTrade. Rice, bananas, cashews, pineapple, mangoes, and coconut products are the       agricultural products exported to neighboring countries. Exported       manufactured products include electronic equipment, machinery, and       clothing. The United States, members of the European Union, and Japan are       the major trading partners. Imports consists of consumer goods and fuel.       The country has mineral and petroleum reserves that have not been       developed because of the mountainous terrain and a lack of funding.\\nTransportation of products is difficult since the highway system beyond       metropolitan Manila consists of two-lane roads that are under constant       repair and sometimes are washed out by typhoons. Interisland shipping       costs add to the expense of manufacturing. Congress, governmental       agencies, and the financial community are attempting to find solutions to       these problems. The rate of road construction is accelerating and a light       rail system is planned. Filipino membership in the Association of South       East Asian Nations (ASEAN), a regional trade organization, is an important       factor in the development of trade policies.\\nDivision of Labor. In rural areas, lack of mechanization causes the entire family to work in       the rice fields. Planting rice seedlings, separating them, replanting,         and changing water levels in the fields are done by hand and are       labor-intensive. Crops such as tobacco, corn, and sugarcane demand full       family participation for short periods during the planting and harvest       seasons.\\nIn the cities, traditional roles common to industrialized countries are       followed. Men perform heavy physical tasks, while women work as clerks and       teachers and in health care.\\nSocial Stratification\\nClasses and Castes. Filipinos believe in the need for social acceptance and feel that       education can provide upward mobility. Color of skin, beauty, and money       are the criteria that determine a person\\'s social position. Light       coloring is correlated with intelligence and a light-skinned attractive       person will receive advancement before his or her colleagues. Family       position and patron-client associations are useful in achieving success.       Government officials, wealthy friends, and community leaders are sponsors       at hundreds of weddings and baptisms each year. Those connections are of       great importance.\\nThere is a gap between the 2 percent of the population that is wealthy and       the masses who live in poverty. The middle class feels too obligated to       those in power to attempt to make societal changes.\\nThe people of the Philippines enjoy watching professional basketball       played by American professional teams and teams in Filipino professional       leagues. Basketball courts are the only sport-site found in every barangay and school. Cockfights are a popular sport among men. Cocks have metal       spurs attached to the leg just above the foot. The contest continues until       one of the cocks is unable to continue fighting or runs away. Cuneta       Astrodome in metropolitan Manila is used for both professional basketball       and cockfights. Mah-jongg, a Chinese game played with tiles, is very       popular, especially with women.\\nSymbols of Social Stratification. Money to buy consumer goods is an indicator of power. Wealthy people lead       western lifestyles. They travel abroad frequently and pride themselves on       the number of Westerners they have as friends. Since few people outside       Manila have a family car, owning a vehicle is a clear statement of a high       social level. Houses and furnishings show a person\\'s social       position. Upholstered furniture instead of the traditional wooden couches       and beds, rows of electrical appliances that are never used and area rugs       are all important.\\nWomen above the poverty level have extensive wardrobes. Sending       one\\'s children to the best schools is the most important indicator       of social position. The best schools often are private schools and are       quite expensive.\\nPolitical Life\\nGovernment. The country has a republican form of government that was developed during       the commonwealth period. It contains three branches: executive,       legislative, and judicial. The first constitution, based on the United       States Constitution, was written in 1935. When President Marcos declared       martial law in 1972, that constitution was replaced by another one       providing for a head of state, a prime minister, and a unicameral       legislature. The president had the power to dissolve the legislature,       appoint the prime minister, and declare himself prime minister. A new       constitution was approved in a national referendum in 1987. It was similar       to the 1935 constitution but included term limitations. The 221 members of       the House may serve three consecutive three-year terms, which is also the       case for provincial governors. The twenty-four senators, who are elected       at large, may serve two consecutive six-year terms. The president serves       one six-year term, but the vice president may serve two consecutive       six-year terms. The president and vice president do not run on the same       ticket and may be political opponents.\\nThe seventy provinces have governors but no legislative bodies. Over sixty       cities have been created by legislation. Cityhood is desirable since       cities are funded separately from the provinces so that additional federal       money comes into the area. Each province is divided into municipalities.       The smallest unit of government is the barangay, which contains up to two       hundred dwellings and an elementary school. The barangay captain       distributes funds at the local level.\\nLeadership and Political Officials. Charges of corruption, graft, and cronyism are common among government       officials at all levels. People accept cronyism and the diversion of a       small percentage of funds as natural. Rewriting the constitution to       eliminate term limits and establishing a strong two-party system are the       reforms that are discussed most often. Politicians move from party to       party as the needs of their constituencies dictate because the political       parties have no ideologies.\\nMany of the people who are currently active in politics were politically       active in the commonwealth era. Men of rank in the military also move into       the\\nA house belonging to a family of the Igorot tribe in Bontoc. The             Philippines are home to approximately sixty ethnic groups in seventy             to eighty language groups.\\npolitical arena. Joseph Estrada, whose term as president is       1998–2004, entered the public eye as a popular film star. He then       became the mayor of a large city and went on to become vice president in       the Ramos administration. Previous presidents have had political or       military backgrounds, with the exception of Corazon Aquino, the president       from 1986 to 1992, who became politically active after her husband was       assassinated.\\nSocial Problems and Control. The formal system of law mirrors that of the United States. A police       force, which has been part of the army since 1991, and a system of trials,       appeals, and prisons are the components of the apparatus for dealing with       crime. Theft is the most common crime. Because the Philippines has a cash       economy, thieves and pick-pockets can easily gain access to thousands of       pesos. Petty thieves are unlikely to be apprehended unless a theft is       discovered immediately. Another common crime is murder, which often is       committed under the influence of alcohol. Guns are readily available.       Incest is punished severely if the victim is younger than fifteen years       old. Capital punishment by lethal injection was restored during the Ramos       administration. Six executions of men convicted of incest have taken place       since 1998. Illicit drugs are found throughout the archipelago but are       more common in the capital area and the tourist centers. Marijuana and       hashish are exported.\\nAn ongoing concern is the desire for autonomy among tribal groups.       Mindanoao and the Cordilleras Autonomous Region, where indigenous groups       are located, are allowed a greater degree of local control and receive       additional funds from the government. Muslim Mindanao has a strong       separatist movement. Terrorist groups have developed in support of the       movement. In the year 2000, terrorists engaged in acts of kidnaping for       ransom, a crime that is common in the country. The government deployed       additional military forces to attack terrorist strongholds.\\nMilitary Activity. The armed forces consist of an army, a navy, a coast guard, and an air       force. The army includes the Philippines National Police; the navy       includes the marines. Military service is voluntary. Public respect for       the military is high. Military expenditures account for 1.5 percent of the       gross domestic product. Current military activity is focused on terrorist       activity in Mindanao. The oil-rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea       are an area of concern that is monitored by the navy. The Spratlys belong       to the Philippines but are claimed by several other countries, and the       Chinese have unsuccessfully         attempted to establish a base there. In 1998, the Philippines signed a       visiting forces agreement that allows United States forces to enter the       country to participate in joint training maneuvers.\\nSocial Welfare and Change Programs\\nLand reform has been a concern since independence. Spanish and American       rule left arable land concentrated in the hands of 2 percent of the       population and those owners will not give up their land without       compensation. Attempts made to provide land, such as the resettlement of       Christian farmers in Mindanao in the 1950s, have not provided enough land       to resolve the problem. Until land reform takes place, poverty will be the       nation\\'s primary social problem. Eighty percent of the rural       population and half the urban population live in poverty. Governmental       organizations provide health clinics and medical services, aid in       establishing micro businesses such as craft shops and small factories, and       offer basic services for the disabled. The number of beggars increases in       times of high unemployment. People consider it good luck to give money to       a poor person, and so beggars manage to survive.\\nNongovernmental Organizations and Other Associations\\nWhile nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) work throughout the country to       solve social problems, they are most visible in metropolitan Manila, where       they work with squatters. The rural poor gravitate to urban areas, cannot       find a place to live, and settle in public areas, riverbanks and garbage       dumps. It is estimated that one of every four residents of metropolitan       Manila is a squatter. Shanty towns are so large that in 2000, when rains       from two successive typhoons made garbage dumps collapse, over two hundred       people were buried alive as their homes were swept away. Nongovernmental       organizations exert pressure on the government for land on which squatters       can build permanent housing. Forced evictions are another target of NGOs,       since an alternative place to live is not provided.\\nVolunteer agencies from the United States, the United Kingdom, the       Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Japan work with NGOs and governmental       agencies. Projects to help children and meet environmental needs are the       focus of volunteer efforts. Volunteer agencies are supervised by the       Philippine National Volunteer Service Coordinating Agency.\\nA farmhouse overlooks vegetables growing on a terraced field. In             these volcanic islands, mountains are common.\\nGender Roles and Statuses\\nDivision of Labor by Gender. Traditional roles prevail in rural areas, where men cultivate the land       but the entire family is involved in planting and harvesting the crops.       Women work in gardens and care for the house and children as well as       barnyard animals. In urban areas, men work in construction and machine       upkeep and as drivers of passenger vehicles. Women work as teachers,       clerks, owners of sari-sari stores, marketers of produce and health care providers. Occupational       gender lines are blurred since men also work as nurses and teachers. In       the professions, gender lines are less important. Women attorneys, doctors       and lawyers are found in the provinces as well as in urban areas.\\nThe Relative Status of Women and Men. While families desire male children, females are welcomed to supply help       in the house and provide a home in the parents\\' old age.       Women\\'s rights to equality and to share the family inheritance with       male siblings are firmly established and are not questioned. The oldest       daughter is expected to become an OSW to provide money for the education       of younger siblings and for the needs of aging family members. Women are       the familial money managers. The wedding         ceremony can include the gift of a coin from the groom to the bride to       acknowledge this role.\\nSince personal relationships and wealth are considered the road to       success, women have an equal opportunity to achieve. Winners of beauty       pageants are likely to succeed in the business and professional world,       especially if the pageant was at an international level.\\nMarriage, Family and Kinship\\nMarriage. Marriage is a civil ceremony that is conducted city offices. A religious       ceremony also is performed. The ceremony is similar to those in the United       States with the addition of sponsors. Principal sponsors are friends and       relatives who have positions of influence in the community. The number of       principal sponsors attests to the popularity and potential success of a       couple. It also reduces a couple\\'s expenses, since each principal       sponsor is expected to contribute a substantial amount of cash. Members of       the wedding party are secondary sponsors who do not have to provide funds.\\nArranged marriages have not been part of Filipino life. However, men are       expected to marry and if a man has not married by his late twenties,       female relatives begin introducing him to potential brides. The median age       for marriage is twenty-two. Young professionals wait until their late       twenties to marry, and engagements of five to seven years are not       uncommon. During this period, the couple becomes established in jobs, pays       for the education of younger siblings, and acquires household items. A       woman who reaches the age of thirty-two without marrying is considered       past the age for marriage. Women believe that marriage to a wealthy man or       a foreigner will guarantee happiness. Divorce is illegal, but annulment is       available for the dissolution of a marriage. Reasons for annulment include       physical incapacity, physical violence, or pressure to change one\\'s       religious or political beliefs. Interfaith marriages are rare.\\nDomestic Unit. The extended family is the most important societal unit, especially for       women. Women\\'s closest friendships come from within the family.       Mothers and daughters who share a home make decisions concerning the home       without conferring with male family members. One child remains in the       family home to care for the parents and grandparents. This child, usually       a daughter, is not necessarily unmarried. The home may include assorted       children from the extended family, and single aunts and uncles. Several       houses may be erected on the same lot to keep the family together.       Childcare is shared. Fathers carry and play with children but are unlikely       to change diapers. Grandparents who live in the home are the primary care       givers for the children since both parents generally work. Preschool       grandchildren who live in other communities may be brought home for their       grandparents to raise. Indigent relatives live in the family circle and       provide as household and childcare help. Young people may work their way       through college by exchanging work for room and board. Family bonds are so       close that nieces and nephews are referred to as one\\'s own children       and cousins are referred to as sisters and brothers. Unmarried adult women       may legally adopt one of a sibling\\'s children.\\nInheritance. Inheritance laws are based on those in the United States. These laws       provide that all children acknowledged by a father, whether born in or out       of wedlock, share equally in the estate. Females share equally with males.\\nKin Groups. Because of the closeness of the immediate family, all familial ties are       recognized. Anyone who is remotely related is known as a cousin.       Indigenous tribes live in clan groups. Marriage into another clan may mean       that the individual is considered dead to his or her clan.\\nPeople have a strong sense of belonging to a place. A family that has       lived in metropolitan Manila for two generations still regards a       municipality or province as its home. New Year\\'s Day, Easter, and       All Saint\\'s Day are the most important family holidays. Bus traffic       from Manila to the provinces increases dramatically at these times, with       hundreds of extra buses taking people home to their families.\\nSocialization\\nInfant Care. Infants are raised by family members. Young children are sent to live       with their grandparents or aunts for extended periods. People who live       outside the country leave their children with the family for the preschool       years.\\nInfants spend their waking time in someone\\'s arms until they can       walk. They are part of every activity and learn by observation. Someone       will remain in the room with them when they sleep. Infant mortality is       high, and so great care is taken of babies. Helpers and older sisters       assist with the dayto-day care of babies.\\nChild Rearing and Education. Children are seldom alone in a system in which adults desire company\\nWorkers spread rice on palm mats to dry in the midday sun. Filipinos             do not consider a meal complete without rice.\\nand do not understand the need for privacy. Children have no pressure to       become toilet trained or to learn to eat at the table. They are spoon fed       or eat from a parent\\'s plate until the age of six. They must learn       respect for authority, obedience, and religious faith. Self-esteem is       fostered. A child\\'s first birthday is celebrated with a party.\\nFilipinos regard education as the path to upward mobility. Ninety percent       of the population over ten years of age is literate. The Department of       Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) is the largest governmental       department. Approximately twelve million elementary school pupils and five       million secondary students attended school in 1999 and 2000. Education is       compulsory until age twelve. Statistics indicate that children from the       poorest 40 percent of the population do not attend school. Elementary       education is a six-year program; secondary education is a four-year       program. Pre-schools and kindergartens are seldom available in public       schools but are in private schools. Children are grouped homogeneously by       ability. First grade students begin being taught in Filipino; English is       added after two months. In elementary and secondary schools, reading,       science, and mathematics are taught in English while values, social       studies, and health are taught in Filipino. Children learn some Filipino       and English words from the media. \"Linga franca\" is an       experimental approach in which students are taught in the native dialect       and Filipino for the first two years and English in the third grade. This       program came about as a response to concerns that English was being used       more than were the native languages.\\nElementary school, secondary school, and college students are required to       wear uniforms. Girls wear pleated skirts and white blouses. Public school       pupils wear dark blue skirts. Each private school has its own color. Boys       wear white shirts and dark pants. Women teachers are given a government       allowance to purchase four uniforms to wear Monday through Thursday. Men       wear dark pants and a barong, a lightweight cotton shirt, or a polo shirt. Female teachers are       addressed as ma\\'am (pronounced \"mum\"). Male teachers       are addressed as sir. These titles are highly prized and are used by       teachers in addressing one another.\\nClass sizes range from twenty to more than fifty in public schools. The       goal is to keep class size below fifty. Pupils may have to share books and       desks. Schools may lack electricity and have dirt floors or be flooded in       the rainy season. The walls may not be painted. The Japanese, Chinese, and       Australians have provided new classrooms, scientific supplies, and teacher       training for the public schools. Private schools charge fees but have       smaller         class sizes. They have a reputation of providing a better education than       do the public schools.\\nComputers are not readily available in elementary or secondary schools       although DECS is stressing technology. President Estrada met with Bill       Gates of Microsoft to procure computers and software for use in the       schools.\\nClassrooms in both public and private schools have a picture of the Virgin       Mary and the president at the front of the room. Grottoes to the Virgin       Mary or a patron saint are found on school campuses. School days begin and       end with prayer.\\nThe school year runs from June to March to avoid the hot months of April       and May. School starts at seven-thirty and ends at four-thirty with a       break of one and a half hours for lunch. No meals are served at the       school, although the parent-teacher association may run a stand that sells       snacks for break time.\\nDropping out is a serious concern. In 1999 and 2000, the high school       dropout rate increased from 9 percent to 13 percent. The increase is       attributed to the need to provide care for younger siblings or to get a       job to enable the family to survive the high inflation and the currency       devaluation that followed the Asian financial crisis. The DECS has a       Non-Formal Education Division to meet the needs of out-of-school youth as       well as the needs of uneducated adults. Programs include adult literacy,       agriculture and farm training, occupational skills, and training in health       and nutrition. Programs for at-risk youth are being added at the high       school level. The Open High School System Act of 2000 is designed to       provide distance learning via television for youths and uneducated adults.\\nHigher Education. A college degree is necessary to obtain positions that promise security       and advancement. Approximately two million students attend colleges and       universities. Each province has a state college system with several       locations. The University of the Philippines, located in Manila, is a       public university that is regarded as the best in the country. Private       colleges are found in the major municipalities. The University of Santo       Tomas in Manila is a private school that was established in 1611; it is       the oldest site of higher education in the country. English is the primary       language of instruction at the college level. Colleges and universities       have large enrollments for advanced degrees since a four year degree may       not be sufficient to work in the higher levels of government service.\\nEtiquette\\nPeople believe that it is one\\'s duty to keep things operating       smoothly. It is very important not to lose face. Being corrected or       correcting another person in public is not considered acceptable behavior.       People want to grant all requests, and so they often say yes when they       mean no or maybe. Others understand when the request is not fulfilled       because saying no might have caused the individual to lose face. When one       is asked to join a family for a meal, the offer must be refused. If the       invitation is extended a second time, it is permissible to accept. Time       consciousness and time management are not important considerations. A       planned meeting may take place later, much later, or never.\\nFilipinos walk hand in hand or arm in arm with relatives and friends of       either sex as a sign of affection or friendship. Women are expected not to       cross their legs or drink alcohol in public. Shorts are not common wear       for women.\\nPeople pride themselves on hospitality. They readily go out of their way       to help visitors or take them to their destination. It is of the highest       importance to recognize the positions of others and use full titles and       full names when introducing or referring to people. Non-verbal language,       such as pointing to an object with one\\'s lips, is a key element in       communication. One greets friends by lifting the eyebrows. A longer lift       can be used to ask a question.\\nReligion\\nReligious Beliefs. The Philippines is the only Christian nation in Asia. More than 85 percent of the people are Roman Catholic. The rosary is said in the home       at 9\\nP.M.\\n, just before the family retires for the night. Children are introduced to       the statue of \"Mama Mary\" at a very early age.\\nProtestant missionaries arrived in 1901 and followed the Catholic example       of establishing hospitals, clinics, and private schools. The Church of the       Latter Day Saints (Mormons) is currently the most active missionary group.\\nSunni Muslims constitute the largest non-Christian group. They live in       Mindanao and the Sulu Islands but have migrated to other provinces. Muslim       provinces celebrate Islamic religious holidays as legal holidays. Mosques       are located in large cities throughout the country. In smaller       communities, Muslims gather in small buildings for services. Animism, a       belief that natural objects have souls, is the oldest religion in the       country, practiced by indigenous peoples in the mountains of Luzon.\\nA roundabout with a fountain sits between old buildings in Manila.             Some areas of the city were destroyed during World War II, when the             country was invaded by Japan and then liberated by the United             States.\\nFreedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution. The disagreement       between the Muslim population of the southern provinces and the federal       government is not so much about religion as it is about political goals.       Non-Catholics do not object to Catholic symbols or prayer in public       venues.\\nEach barangay has a patron saint. The saint\\'s day is celebrated by       a fiesta that includes a religious ceremony. Large amounts of food are       served at each house. Friends and relatives from other barangays are       invited and go from house to house to enjoy the food. A talent show,       beauty contest, and dance are part of the fun. Carnival rides and bingo       games add to the festivities.\\nReligious Practitioners. Religious leaders are powerful figures. Business and political leaders       court Cardinal Jaime Sin because of his influence with much of the       population. Local priest and ministers are so highly respected that       requests from them take on the power of mandates. A family considers       having a son or daughter with a religious career as a         high honor. Personal friendships with priests, ministers, and nuns are       prized. Clerics take an active role in the secular world. An example is       Brother Andrew Gonzales, the current secretary of DECS.\\nFaith healers cure illness by prayer or touch. \"Psychic\"       healers operate without using scalpels or drawing blood. The several       thousand healers are Christians. They believe that if they ask for a fee,       their power will disappear. Patients are generous with gifts because       healers are greatly respected.\\nRituals and Holy Places. The major rituals are customary Christian or Muslim practices. Sites       where miracles have taken place draw large crowds on Sundays and feast       days. Easter is the most important Christian observance. On Easter       weekend, the entire Christian area of the country is shut down from noon       on Maundy Thursday until the morning of Black Saturday. International       flights continue and hospitals are open, but national television       broadcasts, church services, and shops and restaurants are closed and       public transportation is sparse. People stay at home or go to church.       Special events take place on Good Friday. There are religious processions       such as a parade of the statues of saints throughout the community.\\nDeath and the Afterlife. A twenty-four-hour vigil is held at the deceased person\\'s home,       and the body is escorted to the cemetery after the religious ceremony. The       tradition is for mourners to walk behind the coffin. A mausoleum is built       during the lifetime of the user. The size of the edifice indicates the       position of the builder.\\nMourning is worn for six weeks after the death of a family member. It may       consists of a black pin worn on the blouse or shirt of the mourner or       black clothing. Mourning is put aside after one year. A meal or party is       provided for family members and close friends one year after the burial to       commemorate recognize the memory of the deceased.\\nAll Saint\\'s Day (1 November) is a national holiday to honor the       dead. Grave sites are cleared of debris and repaired. Families meet at the       cemetery and stay throughout the twenty-four hours. Candles and flowers       are placed on the graves. Food and memories are shared, and prayers are       offered for the souls of the dead. When a family member visits a grave       during the year, pebbles are placed on the grave to indicate that the       deceased has been remembered.\\nMedicine and Health Care\\nLife expectancy is seventy years for females and sixty-four years for       males. The Health Care Law of\\nPainted Jeepneys on a city street.\\n1995 provides citizens with basic health care at no cost through       subsidies. The working poor are given financial assistance when necessary.       Children receive inoculations at no cost. The World Health Organization       (WHO) declared the Philippines to be polio-free in 2000. It is the first       nation in the world to be recognized for the elimination of polio.\\nRegional public hospitals provide service to everyone. People who live far       away ride a bus for hours to reach the hospital. Funds for ambulances are       raised by lotteries within each barangay or are provided by congressmen       and are used only for the people who live in that area. Private hospitals       are considered superior to public hospitals. Paying patients are not       discharged from hospitals until the bill is paid in full. Patients have kasamas (companions) who remain with them during the hospital stay. Kasamas       assist with nursing chores by giving baths, getting food trays, taking       samples to the nurses\\' station and questioning the doctor. A bed       but no food is provided for the kasama in the hospital room.\\nThe infant mortality rate is 48.9 percent, and one-third of the children       are malnourished. Over 13 percent of preschool and elementary school       children are underweight. A government program provides nutritious food       for impoverished pupils at the midmorning break. This is only offered to       schools in the         poorest areas. National test scores are examined to see if improvement       has occurred. If the scores are better, the program is expanded.\\nThe most prevalent health problem is \"high blood\"       (hypertension). One in ten persons over the age of fifteen has high blood       pressure. Tuberculosis is another health concern; The country has the       fourth highest mortality rate in the world from that disease. Malaria and       dengue fever are prevalent because there is no effective program for       mosquito control. The number of deaths attributed to dengue increased in       the late 1990s.\\nHerbal remedies are used alone or in conjunction with prescribed       medications. A dog bite treated with antibiotics and rabies shots also may       be treated with garlic applied to the puncture. The study of herbal       remedies is part of the school health curriculum. Many elementary schools       have herb gardens that are planted and cared for by the students.\\nSecular Celebrations\\nNew Year\\'s Day is more of a family holiday than Christmas. It is       combined with Rizal Day on 30 December to provide time for people to go       home to their province. Midnight on New Year\\'s Eve brings an       outburst of firecrackers and gunfire from randomly aimed firearms.\\nOther national secular holidays are Fall of Bataan Day, an observation of       the Bataan Death March in 1942 on 9 April. Labor Day is celebrated on 1       May. Independence Day on 12 June celebrates freedom from Spanish rule. It       is celebrated with fiestas, parades, and fireworks. Sino-Filipinos       celebrate the Chinese New Year, which is not a national holiday, in       January or February. In Manila, fireworks and parades take place       throughout Chinatown. Muslims celebrate Islamic festivals.\\nArts and Humanities\\nSupport for the Arts. The government provides support for institutions such as the National       Museum in Manila. Libraries exists in colleges and universities. The best       collections are in Manila. Museums are located in provincial capitals and       in Manila. The Cultural Center of the Philippines in Manila is a center       for the performing arts that opened in 1970. It is a multibuilding complex       created under the direction of former first lady Imelda Marcos, who       encouraged musicians to enter the international community and receive       additional training. Nongovernmental organizations preserve the folk       heritage of the indigenous groups.\\nLiterature. Literature is based on the oral traditions of folklore, the influence of       the church and Spanish and American literature. Filipino written       literature became popular in the mid-nineteenth century as the middle       class became educated. The greatest historical literature evolved from the       independence movement. José Rizal electrified the country with his       novels. During the early years of American control, literature was written       in English. The English and American literature that was taught in the       schools was a factor in the kind of writing that was produced. Writing in       Filipino languages became more common in the late 1930s and during the       Japanese occupation. Literature is now written in both Filipino and       English. Textbooks contain national and world literature.\\nGraphic Arts. The Filipino Academy of Art, established in 1821, shows early art       reflecting Spanish and religious themes. Juan Luna and Felix Hidalgo were       the first Filipino artists to win recognition in Europe at the end of the       nineteenth century. Contemporary artists use a variety of techniques and       mediums to reflect social and political life. Crafts reflect the national       culture. Each area of the country has specialties that range from the       batik cotton prints of the Muslim areas to the wood carvings of the       mountain provinces of Luzon. Baskets and mats are created from rattan.       Textiles are woven by hand in cooperatives, storefronts, and homes. Banana       and pineapple fiber cloth, cotton, and wool are woven into textiles.       Furniture and decorative items are carved. Silver and shell crafts also       are created\\nSex and violence are major themes in films, which are often adaptations of       American screen productions. American films are popular and readily       available, and so high-quality Filipino films have been slow to develop.\\nPerformance Arts. Drama before Spanish colonization was of a religious nature and was       intended to persuade the deities to provide the necessities of life. The       Spanish used drama to introduce the Catholic religion. Filipino themes in       drama developed in the late nineteenth century as the independence       movement evolved. Current themes are nationalistic and reflect daily life.\\nDance is a mixture of Filipino and Spanish cultures. Professional dance       troupes perform ballet, modern dance, and folk dance. Folk dances are       performed at meetings and conferences and reflect a strong Spanish       influence. Indigenous dances are used in historical pageants. An example       is a bamboo dance relating a story about a bird moving among the reeds.       People enjoy ballroom dancing for recreation.         Dance instructors are available at parties to teach the waltz and the       cha-cha.\\nMusic performance begins in the home and at school. Amateur performances       featuring song and dance occur at fiestas. Popular music tends to be       American. Guitars are manufactured for export; folk instruments such as       the nose flute also are constructed.\\nThe State of the Physical and Social Sciences\\nThe physical sciences focus on the needs of the country. Aquaculture, the       development of fish and shellfish farms in coastal areas, is a rapidly       growing field. Centuries of fishing and dynamiting fish have changed the       balance of nature. Hormonal research to stimulate the growth of fish and       shellfish is a priority. Control of red tide, an infestation that makes       shellfish unsafe to eat, is another area of concentration. Agricultural       research and research into volcano and earthquake control are other areas       of study. The development of geothermal and other energy sources is       ongoing. Other environmental research areas of importance are waste       resource management, water resource management, and forest management. The       social sciences are focused on the needs of the country with the primary       emphasis on resolving the problems of poverty and land reform.\\nBibliography\\nDepartment of Education, Culture and Sports.

Industry leaders say                                the hiring growth rate last year was particularly                                low at 2-4% due to a lack of skilled applicants.                                For every new hire, industry leaders say they                                receive about five \"near-hires\", or applicants who                                must undergo extensive training in oral English                                and keyboarding before they meet minimum job                                requirements.\\nThe future of the industry                                is clearly at stake. \"ITES or cyberservices are                                certainly the future of the Philippines,\" said                                Henry Schumacher, executive director of the                                European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines.                                \"But that will not work unless you have English as                                a communicating base, and we have seen over the last maybe 10 years that the English speaking                                capability [of Filipinos] has declined.

Nowadays, Filipinos\\' widespread use of \"Taglish\"                                often perplexes their international business                                partners, including Norwegian shipping company                                managers, who say that they often cross linguistic                                wires when speaking with their Filipino ship                                crews.

In 2000, there were only four                                call centers in the country, employing 2,400                                call-center agents.

From the 1970s to the 1990s, the bulk                                of Filipino labor exports were composed of                                low-skilled workers, mostly construction workers,                                domestic helpers, and entertainers.\\nBy                                2000, however, officials from the Philippine                                Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), a                                government agency managing the placement of                                overseas Filipino workers, recorded a rising tide                                of fleeing skilled workers and professionals,                                including doctors, nurses, engineers, information                                technology professionals and banking                                professionals, among others. In other words,                                precisely the types of workers outsourcing                                companies would most like to hire.\\nThe                                growing scarcity of English speakers has alarmed                                the Philippines-based outsourcing community, which                                executives say they began to notice shortages as                                early as 2003. Many of these companies have since                                established training programs at private                                universities and human resource consulting companies that train potential recruits.\\nFor instance, outsourcer FuturePerfect is                                helping Mapua Institute of Technology, one of the                                leading engineering and technology schools in                                Manila, to develop their English language                                curriculum and retrain their English instructors.

Perhaps predictably, he played down                                the labor shortage, chalking it up to media hype.                                \"I\\'ve met with several call centers lately, and                                they told me their hiring rate of fresh graduates                                who walk in to apply is now significantly higher                                at 8-10%,\" said Locsin. \"Last year, it was 2-4%.

      "[0.00017028711603273632, '5. Interpersonal Heterosexual Behaviors\\nA. Children\\nIn Filipino society today, it is not unusual for preteenage boys to engage in exploratory \\x93sex\\x94 games with other boys and girls. Such exploratory play allows the child to reassure him/herself of the normality of his or her body. This kind of childhood sexual rehearsal games was more common in the past and in rural areas, when violence and drugs were not as devastating as they are now in the urban areas. In some cases, boys would observe couples kissing and hugging in the park. Occasionally, they sit in the balconies of movie theaters where couples are engaging in heavy petting. In the rural areas and barrios, boys commonly compare their bodies with a friend, relative, or schoolmates. Generally speaking, parents and other adults have a mildly negative response when they discover child sexual play, ranging from warnings to spankings.\\nB. Adolescents\\nOur knowledge of the sexual attitudes and behaviors of the Filipino youth is limited to a very few anecdotal reports, most of which deal with middleand upper-class urban teenagers rather than the rural poor and urban street children. In this very limited context, my personal experience was the basis of my premedical school thesis on \\x93First Night Sexual Experience of Young Boys - 1968.\\x94 This study consisted of personal interviews with 80 adolescents in the rural areas of Cebu during social dances and summer festivals. The majority of these teenagers were interested in obtaining information regarding nocturnal emissions, love, sexual intercourse, and, for women, contraception and pregnancy. Most of the males\\x92 ideas on sexuality were derived from older boys, brothers, and their uncles. On the other hand, the girls were too timid or shy to answer the sexuality questions.\\nDuring the author\\x92s return visit to the Philippines in July 1995 as an invited speaker at a college sociocultural conference, he arranged an impromptu meeting with middle and high school students, grades seven through ten. They informed me that most of their teachers believed that they were too young to hear about sex education. The teachers did not allow questions from their students during the lecture on \\x93family education.\\x94 Most instructors were too insecure and embarrassed, and so were unable to facilitate any in-depth dialogue. In Catholic Filipino society, the Christian dogma still has a strong influence on the teachers\\x92 moral and religious values, so that, despite the presence of a government-mandated educational climate, sexuality remains taboo in public discussion. Unfortunately, these teenagers were afraid to elaborate further, confessing only that it is attitudes like this, repeated in their conservative homes, that make them view society and family cynically.\\nIn Christian colleges and universities, being pregnant out of wedlock can result in expulsion. In most public non-sectarian universities, sex education is still mostly non-existent except for those basic biological courses and family planning programs mandated by the government in 1972. However, in the largest government-run university, the University of the Philippines, sex education courses are more in-depth and liberal, because of the sophistication of the instructors and department heads who are Westernized and comfortable with controversial and sensitive ideas.\\nAlthough still limited, some might say elementary, sexuality courses in most urban medical schools are generally open to updating because of the infusion of new ideas from visiting professors and experts in periodic international forums and conferences. The best medical school students can graduate as doctors at the young age of 23, a factor that makes their communications with patients about sexual issues difficult at best.\\nPubertal Rites for Boys\\nThe anatomical and physiological changes that herald puberty are universal to the human race. However, in Filipino society, the sociocultural pubertal rites are expressed in a variety of customs and traditions depending on the particular subculture and its religious orientation. In the Christian tradition, the custom is to circumcise all males. Male circumcision is performed either by a medical doctor trained in this surgery or by a traditional medicine man. Filipino boys may be circumcised as newborn infants or somewhere around age 8 to 10 years, when they are in the third or fourth grade. City dwellers and the sophisticated elite have their newborn males circumcised before they are discharged from the hospital. Working class and poor families seldom have their newborns circumcised, but usually wait until the boys are 9 or 10 years of age. The medicine man is not a medical doctor, but a man of ordinary skills who has learned the art of circumcision handed down from his father or grandfather.\\nCircumcision is done in two ways. In superincision, a dorsal-mesal cut is made along the length of the upper surface of the penis, from the base to the foreskin, or only on the top of the foreskin. In the coronal technique, the excess foreskin is removed with a circular incision, as is the practice in Europe and North America. When a medical doctor performs either of these types of circumcision, the incision is closed by sutures and oral antibiotics are prescribed to avoid post-operative infection. The medicine man, on the other hand, only performs the dorsal slit circumcision, using a specially \\x93cleaned\\x94 (not sterilized) sharp knife or a modified slender \\x93machete\\x94 as scalpel. The medicine man uses neither antibiotics nor anesthesia.\\nThis pubertal initiation traditionally occurs in the spring or when the schools begin summer recess, somewhere in May or June. The ceremony commences when boys, aged 8 to 12 years old, march in procession, usually in groups of ten to twelve, to the medicine man\\x92s house. The medicine man, with the parents\\x92 knowledge and consent, will then lead the boys to a secluded place, a clearing in a thicket or on a farm to insure privacy. The boy with pants removed, is seated on the edge of a rock or stump of a tree, while the medicine man sharpens and cleans the knife. Despite this tension-producing build-up, the boy must remain calm and composed to show that he is brave and ready to enter the new realm of adulthood and can handle the rigors of manhood. The medicine man places the knife\\x92s sharpest side underneath the tip of the excess prepuce (avoiding the glans penis). He instructs the boy to look up, saying \\x93look for a bird or a plane,\\x94 diverting his attention. In a split second, a piece of wood or a branch is struck down against the knife, resulting in a midline cut or dorsal slit of the prepuce. Bleeding may be profuse or minimal. The juice of a certain tropical palm plant (nipa palm) is squeezed over the wound as a post-surgical anesthetic and caustic agent to stop the bleeding. No wound dressing is applied to cover the fresh and rugged incision. A clamp of cobwebs or a mesh scraped from the underside of a coconut palm branch over the incision serves as a bandage and additional clotting agent (to stop further bleeding). In some parts of the Philippines, the medicine man spits on the wound pre-chewed tobacco or a concoction of guava (a tropical peach-like fruit) leaves to act as a clotting agent. Both the cobwebs and coconut palm scrapings act as mechanical meshes to trap blood platelets in order to stop bleeding. The guava leaves mixed with saliva has papase, a chemical agent that medically can minimize post-operation swelling and sometimes arrest bleeding.\\nAfter circumcision, the boys walk home without a sound of complaint or grimace of pain. It is interesting to note that a particular gait can be discerned before and after the circumcision. The boys naturally walk normally on their way to the medicine man\\x92s house. When they walk back to their homes, their gait is characterized by a \\x93frog-like\\x94 walk, in which the knees are spread away from each other in order to avoid the thighs touching the newly circumcised genitalia. For three to five days, the circumcised boys stay home. Some wear skirts borrowed from their sisters or mothers, not pants, so that clothes do not touch or accidentally hit the sensitive, partially exposed glans (head) penis. Despite daily wound washing in the ocean, a river, or stream, about 90 to 95 percent of these cases of non-sterile circumcision become infected. It takes about six to eight weeks for the wound to heal, usually without ugly scars or deforming penile skin adhesions.\\nIn the 1970s, Muslim boys were not usually circumcised unless their parents were well-educated and health-aware of Westernized attitudes of that time. In the early 1950s, boys of minority families in the north were not circumcised. However, with the arrival of foreign Christian missionaries and their conversion to Christianity, most of the boys are now circumcised either by a medicine man or a physician.\\nPuberty Rites for Young Females\\nChristian girls undergo two phases of social transition to womanhood: ritual ear piercing and a cotillion or debutantes\\x92 ball. Ear piercing is neither a religious nor a pubertal rite. It is just a custom, a traditional \\x93tribal\\x94 rite of socially announcing that the person is a girl. The piercing of the ear is usually done between one month after birth and 2 or 3 years of age. In some parts of the country, the girl is much older. Ear piercing is usually done by a hair stylist, a \\x93medicine woman,\\x94 or medical person. Outpatient procedures by medical personnel use properly sterilized needles. Oftentimes, however, no anesthesia or antibiotic is given when the piercing is done by a hair stylist or a medicine woman. In general, however, infections from ear piercing are not as common as in male circumcisions done by a medicine man with an unsterilized knife. Phase two, the debutante\\x92s ball or cotillion, is a social introduction of young females ages 16 to 18 years in the form of an elaborate party or dinner dance. The hostess of this social event is an 18-year-old female usually from the rich families. Cotillion is an old Spanish tradition, dating back to colonial days, when the daughters of foreign dignitaries or tenured Spanish government officials were introduced to the eligible bachelors of the equally rich in order to secure the daughter\\x92s future financial and sociopolitical status as eligible and eminently suitable future wives.\\nIn the Muslim or Moros community, about 10 percent of the Filipino population, the ear-piercing ritual is the same as among Christians. In the early 1950s, the older girls would wear a veil. At present, young females seldom use veils or cover their faces. Some Muslims include the cotillion in their rite of passage, but for others, dancing or any form of partying is absolutely prohibited and considered sacrilegious.\\nThe minorities, Ifugaos, Kalingas, Igorots, and others, account for 3 to 5 percent of the population. These females, like most Filipinas, have their ears pierced at any early age. However, in some tribes, family wealth and status are demonstrated by the number of earrings or the layers of necklaces worn. No form of female circumcision or genital mutilation has been recorded. Anecdotal reports suggest that during the pre-Hispanic colonial days, some tribal females wore multi-appendage rings, nose, and lip rings. These tribal cultures do not observe the cotillion.\\nPremarital Sexual Activities\\nSexual attitudes and behavior differ from one group of Filipino youth to another, depending on their social class, educational level, and place of residence. In metropolitan and large cities, Manila, Quezon, Cebu, Iloilo, Davao, Dumaquete, and Zamboanga, adolescents and young adults are exposed to the cosmopolitan life and consequently receive more information on sex and sexuality. They are also freer to experience numerous options than are less educated youths. Youth in small towns have narrower and more restricted ideas on sexuality, because of the family\\x92s and Church\\x92s strong control and influence. Furthermore, youngsters in big cities have easy access to adult magazines and entertainment, in which sexuality is openly discussed or shown, even though their parents and the Church try to hide such information from them. The majority of urban youth knows about contraceptives and can acquire these from pharmacies or from friends without problems. Despite the guilt and shame associated with sex, middle- and upper-class urban youth often engage in sexual contacts with girlfriends, household maids, and even prostitutes. For the youths of the poverty belts around the big cities, the situation is compounded by the lack of money and self-control. Even if they would prefer to use a contraceptive, they cannot afford them and there are no places where they can get them free. Oral contraceptives are only given free to married women for family planning purposes by government-run city and municipal health clinics. Although condoms were distributed freely in public high schools in the early 1990s on a mandate from the Secretary of Health as part of an STD and HIV prevention program, this practice was later discontinued because of a public outcry that it was ineffective and because of the Church\\x92s persistent objections.\\nThe situation for rural (barrios) youth is quite different. They learn and receive information about sex and sexual behavior from observing farm animals, from magazines, from clandestine \\x93boys only\\x94 meetings, and from the relations between parents and other family members in homes where there is little privacy. The prevailing Catholic dogma on sexual morality is written deep in the unconsciousness of every boy and girl. Only a few years ago, 98 percent of the youth associated premarital sex with guilt and sin. Only recently has this begun to change. In 1994, the Youth Adult Sexuality Survey (Zablan 1994) revealed that about 18 percent accepted premarital sex, although a majority of 80 percent still believed it was a sin and morally unacceptable.\\nOnly a few general surveys about the sexual life of younger Filipinos exist; most of what is known is based on anecdotal reports. The author\\x92s experiences are with interviews of preselected groups of the youth population conducted during periodic sojourns back to the Philippines. The samples mainly consist of middle-class youth, ages 17 to 22, who were encouraged to bring to the meeting problems related to their sexual lives and development. Repeatedly, they expressed regret that these aspects of their lives that engender so much anguish and fears could not be explicitly discussed in the intimacy of their household.\\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that first premarital sexual activities are initiated at an earlier age, especially for those in metropolitan areas, where the basic family structure often disintegrates because of a lack of parental supervision, with both parents working or the father absent and perhaps working overseas. Young males pursuing college and graduate studies in the city are often detached from parental supervision and frequently succumb to the lure of metropolitan temptations, go-go bars, and adultentertainment houses. Twenty to 25 percent have their first sexual experiences with prostitutes, either out of peer pressure or curiosity. In a few cases, youths in smaller communities who impregnate their girlfriends may be forced to marry them or make an amicable financial arrangement with parental approval. The woman usually keeps the child in her parents\\x92 home instead of giving it up for adoption.\\nIn the Muslim communities, premarital sex is absolutely prohibited. But young girls, ages 14 to 16, can be betrothed through the usual (parental) marriage arrangement, mainly to affluent and much older bridegrooms.\\nAmong girls, the memories of being deflowered were somewhat different from those of the boys. Because of guilt and shame, the majority of young females did not bother to get prior information about sexual intercourse and the possible consequences of their first sexual encounters. They perceived their first intercourse as the fulfillment of young love, motivated by peer pressure to keep their boyfriends, and at the same time as a \\x93challenge\\x94 to parental authority or a gross transgression of a religious or social taboo. For the well-educated and sophisticated city dwellers, it was a calculated act to get rid of the old-fashioned social taboo (virginity), which they perceived as an obstacle to entering into a more mature and fulfilling sexual life, or plainly to catch the men of their dreams. It is interesting to note that, compared with the United States and other industrialized nations, Filipino teenagers are probably less sexually active; thus teenage pregnancy is less of a problem than elsewhere.\\nMost of the children born to single mothers are kept in the teenager\\x92s mother\\x92s home, instead of being given up for adoption. In the 1970s, a pregnant teenager was a social outcast and was subjected to severe parental scorn. However, in the 1990s, because of Western influence and financial difficulties, a pregnant teenager is somewhat more tolerated, and her parents are less condemning and more accepting of any financial help the teenage father might offer.\\nC. Adults\\nCourtship, Dating, and Relationships\\nAs mentioned previously, Chinese influence runs deep and the majority of Filipinas adhere to its simple social dictum, \\x93Get married at a marriageable age.\\x94 Marriage is considered the natural conclusion of a stable heterosexual relationship. Recently, however, Filipinos have started to replace their old-fashioned social concepts with ones that recognize that the right to remain single is as much a personal right as the right to marry. Because of the Western influence on women\\x92s liberation, to be a single older woman is no longer considered a social disgrace or the result of any personal inadequacy.\\nCohabitation\\nThe colonial view of the sacredness of marriage includes a strong social condemnation of cohabitation for unmarried couples. Thus, cohabitation was relatively rare during the 1940s. The social and legal implications of \\x93common-law marriage\\x94 (cohabitation) are not significant in a society of less affluence and resources. Furthermore, the definition of unmarried used in compiling official statistics makes it difficult to estimate the popularity of this behavior in the sense it is understood in the Western Hemisphere. Beginning in the late 1980s, the increased tolerance of non-marital cohabitation in the West began to influence the middle-aged and younger generations. During the author\\x92s 1996 visit in the provinces of Cebu, Leyte, and metropolitan Manila, there was an estimated increase of half a percent and an estimated 340,000 couples in unmarried cohabitation. The majority of cohabiting couples in the provinces are separated from their legal spouses because divorce is illegal and they cannot be civilly or religiously married. The rest are college students, youth, artists, and intellectuals who are attracted to this lifestyle.\\nCourtship is a cherished Filipino tradition with certain specific rules based on religious, sociocultural, and family values. There are five widely shared rules or \\x93commandments\\x94 associated with courtship:\\nSay \\x93yes\\x94 to the first invitation.\\nIt is a prerequisite to have an escort, either a friend or next of kin, on the first date (no escort is necessary for a woman 28 years or older.\\nIt is all right to publicly demonstrate decent affection, such as kissing, touching, and caressing.\\nA young Filipina should reserve criticism after the first date, be discreet about her feelings, and the man must cover (pay for) all expenses.\\nIf dating leads to marriage, one must remember that marrying entails marrying into the spouse\\x92s whole family as a clan.\\nThe majority of young men and women believe that love, physical attraction, similar religious beliefs, and trust are the basic essentials in creating and maintaining a stable relationship.\\nAdults, Marriage, and the Family\\nThe marriage ceremony is usually preceded by an engagement. For the rich and middle class, betrothal is marked with elaborate parties. On the other hand, the low-income class concludes the occasion with a firm handshake and/or a sip of a local wine or homemade ferment. The engagement and wedding are usually a happy, festive occasion. However, if questions of family honor and shame arise, the outcome may be violent and deadly, as happened at the time of this writing, when a male\\x92s family massacred the bride-to-be\\x92s family because she slept with another man two days before the wedding. The community accepted the outcome as a proper punishment for the betrayal and unbearable shame caused to the bridegroom\\x92s family.\\nWhereas the legal age for voting is 21 years for both males and females, the legal age for marriage is 21 for males and 18 for females. In the Muslim community, the parents of a girl between ages 14 and 16 may betroth her to an older man. Generally, in the Christian community, the courts do not consider pregnancy a valid motive to grant permission for the marriage of a minor. Legislation has also abolished the possibility of reparatory marriage; in the past a person accused of rape or forceful abduction could avoid punishment by marrying the victim. In the southern end of the archipelago, where the majority of the Muslims live, a dowry is agreed on before a formal marriage arrangement is signed. The dowry, given by the bride\\x92s parents to the groom, may be a large sum of money, property, or a sizable wedding present.\\nMuslim marriages are conducted by a judge or an imam (a religious cleric), Christian marriages by a priest or pastor. Civil marriages are recognized and accepted in both the Christian and Muslim communities when conducted by judges and commercial chiefs, such as pilots and ship captains.\\nAlthough polygyny had a long history in pre-colonial Filipino civilization and was common in the Muslim community prior to the 1970s, polygynous marriages are the exception today. The majority of sophisticated, highly educated males, whether Muslim or Christian, choose to be monogamous for financial reasons. Middle- and upper-class Filipino families also elect to have fewer children, two on average, as compared to three or more for the less educated and low-income families.\\nWith the advance of information technology, foreigners seeking brides with traditional values can now surf the Internet for a modest fee. Companies also advertise \\x93mail order brides\\x94 in different magazines and specialty journals. There are currently about 100 companies competing to lure mail-order bride customers, such as \\x93Cherry Blossoms,\\x94 \\x93Asian Rose,\\x94 and \\x93Exotic Girls.\\x94 The service charge can range from a basic $150 to upwards of $2,500. For $150, the bridegroom-to-be will receive a brief biographical sketch and a photo or video of the woman. He can correspond with her in letters or even phone calls. He can arrange to go to the Philippines and see her at his own expense. For $2,500, the services include airfare, hotel accommodations, and a two- or three-day tour to personally interact with the candidate bride(s). The client is introduced to different women during a party and the couples can interact socially.\\nA major shortcoming of this venue for finding a mate is that the interested males are not screened properly. These men can be psychopaths, criminals, or worse. In some cases, a syndicate of \\x93Internet bride-merchants\\x94 sells young women aged 14 to 18, oftentimes with fake birth certificates, for a mere $3,000. These women are admitted to the United States on a fianc�e\\x92s visa. Parents with severe income hardship frequently sign the contract believing that their daughters will either be given a job opportunity or be future brides of these unscrupulous foreigners. Recently, a congressman from the state of New Jersey sponsored a bill in the United States Congress to severely restrict the issuing of these \\x93fianc�e\\x92s visas\\x94 and to stop the practice of \\x93bride-to-be/sex slave\\x94 businesses. Newspaper reports and embassy communiqu�s have documented that many young Filipino mailorder and Internet brides are held captive, raped, divorced, and then pressed into prostitution.\\nThere are no credible published data on marital sexual satisfaction or on the status of Filipino marital life. According to the author\\x92s informal survey and radio-talk-show interviews in 1995, 15 to 20 percent of Filipinos are unhappily married. Women, more often than men, reported having sexual intercourse not because they desired it, but to please their spouses. Whereas 35 percent of males would like to increase the frequency of sexual intercourse, especially those in their 20s and 30s, most of the women were satisfied with the frequency of sex; only 5 percent of the females were interested in more frequent sex. These gender differences may be explained as the result of a greater pressure on males for sexual performance to maintain their macho image and maintain total control over women.\\nA majority of women complained of the brief duration of foreplay and premature ejaculation. Sexual intercourse is limited almost exclusively to penetration, which is more common among the less educated, more devotedly religious couples, and the older age groups. The average duration of foreplay is about five minutes, that of coitus about five to six minutes. On the other hand, the more educated, sophisticated, younger age group, and the \\x93unchurched\\x94 have a longer duration of sexual foreplay and coitus, about twenty-two minutes. Although premature ejaculation is not uncommon among males, very few men seek medical help. Husbands generally do not consider premature (early) ejaculation a problem.\\nIn the Christian community, sexual activity is not prohibited during any religious event or celebration. In some cases, Christian women make the personal choice of not having sex during their menstrual period. On the other hand, Muslim custom does not allow any sexual activity during the menstrual period, between sundown Friday and sundown Saturday, and during Ramadan, the month-long period of daytime fasting.\\nIt is difficult to gather data on female orgasm because of religious repression and personal shyness. It is believed that Filipinas\\x92 sexual satisfaction is based on cultural and religious grounds. The husband\\x92s satisfaction is primary and the wife\\x92s orgasm clearly secondary. Young, educated, and less religious or unchurched women have a higher orgasmic rate as compared to their older, less-educated, (oftentimes) more religious, and shy counterparts. It is believed that for a majority of women who experienced orgasms, it was more a result of psychological and religious expectation and not so much because of oral or manual genital stimulation. However, the barrage of media and Western influences has increased the proportion of Filipinas who prefer both psychic and physical stimulation. Filipinas are bombarded by the mass media and performing arts with messages about more openness in sexual matters, greater gender equality, information about new techniques for lovemaking, new roles within the couple, and new opportunities for extramarital relationships. These issues are also conversation matter among friends and families, at business meetings, and at almost any social-civic gatherings.\\nDivorce and Remarriage\\nThe Catholic Church does not allow divorce of any kind, but it will grant annulments, which most Filipinos find socially distasteful. However, generally, we find civil decrees of legal separation, divorce, and annulment are becoming more socially acceptable for Christian and Muslim Filipinos. A civil divorce requires that the ex-husband support the children and provide some assistance to the ex-wife along with household maintenance.\\nSlightly more acceptable are consensual separations. What is popular today is having a court declare a marriage null and void under the Family Code (Executive order 209, article 36). The Family Code has adopted the grounds of \\x93psychological incompatibility\\x94 as a basis for civil annulments. This was the criterion for annulment articulated by the Catholic Church forty years ago after the Vatican II Council, when annulments became much more common. A civil annulment dissolves the marriage and leaves both parties free to remarry. With the incidence of annulments clearly increasing in the mid-1990s, Filipino Senator A. D. (Nikki) Coseteng introduced in the legislature a pro-marriage anti-divorce bill (no. 179), which now legally defines marriage as an inviolable social institution and the foundation of the family.\\nThe incidence of remarriage is not presently known. However, both in the rural and metropolitan areas, cohabitation is on the upswing because of Western influences and financial problems. In major cities, younger, more sophisticated, and affluent women have more chances for remarriage, but priests will not officiate at a second marriage ceremony unless the Catholic Church has annulled the previous marriage. Despite liberalization in the dissolution or annulment of marriages, the main reason why the divorce rate is still relatively low, when compared to the industrialized countries, is most likely the pervasive influence of the Catholic Church and parental moral values. The importance of extended family norms derives, not only as a source of emotional support and the context for the development of profound personal relations, but also for many other aspects of social life, from financial support to finding a job. Legal separation, divorce, and annulment are still frequently perceived as evidence of personal failure and as a \\x93social anomaly.\\x94 The end of the relationship is not viewed as freedom and independence, but as the beginning of a different period in one\\x92s personal life.\\nExtramarital Sexual Activities\\nMost of the causes of legal separation involve extramarital affairs. Adultery or extramarital sex is vehemently condemned by the Catholic Church and is socially detested. However, there is an issue of legal terminology and social definition. Under Filipino penal laws, a man does not commit adultery unless he violates the law against concubinage. To be guilty of concubinage, a man must:\\nkeep a mistress within the conjugal dwelling;\\nhave sexual intercourse with another woman under scandalous circumstances; or\\ncohabit with another woman outside the conjugal dwelling.\\nHaving sexual intercourse with a women who is not one\\x92s wife does not in itself violate the law of concubinage. Nor is the ban on concubinage violated if a man fathers a child with a woman who is not his wife. A wife commits adultery simply by having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband, regardless of the circumstances.\\nThe provisions of the Penal Code on female adultery and male concubinage are glaring examples, not only of the inequality between the sexes, but also of the inequity between erring spouses. The law provides a maximum penalty of four years imprisonment for the erring husband. The concubine shall be meted a penalty of destierro, wherein she is prohibited from setting foot within the man\\x92s residence. A wife found guilty of adultery, on the other hand, may be imprisoned for a maximum period of six years. Some lawmakers have pointed out that it is easier to send a female to jail and that this violates the constitutional provision on equality of the sexes. In simple terms, the law does not criminalize the sexual infidelity of a married man except under certain circumstances. This, some lawmakers point out, seems to imply that the extramarital affairs of men are acceptable as long as they are discreet in handling them - a clear reflection of the double standard mentality of society with regard to sexual infidelity.\\nA 1996 survey conducted by an advertising and research group revealed that out of 485 married men in metropolitan Manila, 51 percent admitted having had extramarital affairs. The survey results reflect the machismo culture in the Philippines, wherein a man\\x92s worth, among other things, is also equated with his ability to lure other women. In an attempt to correct this inequality in 1997, Senator M. Santiago filed a bill simplifying marital infidelity. In her measure, she proposed that the extramarital sex by either the husband or wife be called adultery, whether the extramarital partner is of the other or same sex. The House committee made amendments to her bill and put the marital offense under a single crime called \\x93marital infidelity,\\x94 eliminating the separate provisions on concubinage and adultery, and the consideration of whether the infidelity occurs within the couple\\x92s home or elsewhere. Congress proposed a maximum penalty of six years for all parties concerned. Speaking for the Women\\x92s Legal Bureau, a non-governmental organization (NGO), E. Ursua claimed that imposing criminal liability on the offenders is not the answer. \\x93We do not think criminalizing is the proper solution. We can\\x92t force someone to be faithful.\\x94\\nThe new law penalizes the guilty party with imprisonment, regardless of the reasons behind the infidelity. A woman escaping from an abusive or violent relationship, or one who simply falls out of love and finds growth and fulfillment with another person, is treated no differently than a man who keeps several mistresses. In effect, the law also punishes individuals who get out of marriages that are bereft of love, respect, and trust. Some legal organizations propose a modified \\x93divorce\\x94 law and/or a new bill to decriminalize sexual infidelity. But Senator Santiago countered that this might send a \\x93subliminal message\\x94 to the youth that the state is encouraging \\x93free love.\\x94\\nIn the Muslim world, adultery is severely punished, with the perpetrators either made social outcasts or, in rural villages, stoned to death in public. This \\x93fatal justice\\x94 is carried out clandestinely as an expression of community justice that government magistrates (datu) can do nothing to either prevent or punish. The whole village maintains a \\x93code of silence,\\x94 because this punishment is written in the Muslim moral marital law. There is no witness to interrogate or testify.\\nDuring the Spanish colonial days, 1775 to 1899, rich Filipinos who owned haciendas (estates or a large parcel of land) and employed several female domestic helpers could easily have extramarital relations with their female employees, with or without the knowledge of their wives. Today, we still find married men in all walks of life who maintain a long-standing relationship with a second woman, oftentimes with the knowledge and approval of their spouses, and even of their grown children. In some cases, an extramarital affair can end a politician\\x92s career; in other cases, an affair, even when its makes headlines, may have no political consequences. Some couples find extramarital affairs a solution that keeps their marriage alive. The man may be freed to satisfy sexual needs he does not dare, because of religious restrictions, reveal to his wife, while the wife is relieved of any pressure to change her sexual behavior. Most wives who adopt this compromise have limited horizons in their lives and a very low sexual appetite. Less common is a marriage in which both the husband and wife have extramarital relationships by mutual knowledge and agreement. In such cases, usually the husband has a job that keeps him abroad for long periods of time, with periodic visits to wife and family. Occasionally, Filipinos who married, found employment abroad, immigrated for a few years, and married a second woman while abroad, bring their second wives back when they return and set up a second household in a different dwelling. Discovery of this bigamous affair can be costly if the courts become involved. Legal penalties for bigamy can bring up to four years in prison and fines for moral and psychological damages between $500 and $1,300 US.\\nThese relationships pose a serious problem in Philippine society because many of these men resist the use of condoms, do not practice safe sex, and pay no attention to the possibility that their regular or occasional partner(s) may be HIV-positive.\\nIncidence of Oral and Anal Sex\\nBoth the Christian and Islamic sects abhor oral and anal sex acts. The Muslim tradition specifically requires the husband to enter the wife by natural means in penile-vaginal intercourse. Oral sex, which in the past was condemned as \\x93unnatural,\\x94 is practiced more or less by educated Christians who live in the metropolitan areas. From the 1950s to the 1970s, when there was no constant supply on electricity in many towns and areas of the country, professional couples enhanced their sexual lives by using pornographic and specialty magazines. In the 1970s and 1980s, with electricity more widely available, middle-class and upper-class couples used film projectors, and later videocassette players, to enhance their sexual repertoire and learn about alternatives to penile-vaginal intercourse that could bring renewed vigor to their routine sex lives.\\nAnecdotal reports suggest that oral sex is practiced by 10 to 15 percent and tried by 20 percent of the professional couples (i.e., doctors, lawyers, and businesspersons who travel a lot). The majority of Filipinos, however, still consider oral sex as dirty and unnatural. For the few who engage in oral sex, cunnilingus is acceptable, but Filipinas will only very rarely engage in fellatio. In general, older and lower-class Filipinos have a more negative view of oral and anal sex.\\nModern Filipino youth, however, seem to be taking a new look at Westernized sexual expressions, according to what they said at the author\\x92s impromptu meetings. Although no general survey data are available, a segmental study of metropolitan youths revealed two groups of young women based on their responses. One group accepts and practices oral sex as a way of avoiding the risk of pregnancy, maintaining their technical virginity until marriage, and/or as a form of safer sex. For the second group, oral sex was a more intimate form of sexual relationship, somehow more \\x93romantic\\x94 than genital intercourse. Youths holding the latter view believed that oral sex should be only engaged in with a stable (engaged to be married) partner and not in the first few exploratory encounters or dates. Some other older girls joined some boys in rejecting this way of expressing love, and thought that only prostitutes could practice fellatio on boys.\\nWhereas anal intercourse is not part of the fantasies for the majority of devout Christian women, anecdotal reports revealed that 30 to 40 percent of males fantasized about having anal sex with women other than their wives. Prejudices against anal sex are even stronger in less educated youths. Most of the youths I spoke with do not accept anal sex even after marriage, perhaps influenced by the increasing incidence of AIDS in the Orient. Older boys agreed that a woman will never ask for it.\\nIES - Countries - The Philippines  - Homoerotic, Homosexual, and Ambisexual Behaviors\\n', 134]\n",

Aquino penned Executive Order No. 118 creating the  Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts. Five years later, in 1992, this  presidential directive was enacted into law-- Republic  Act 7356 , creating the National Commission for Culture and the  Arts (NCCA). The original bill was jointly authored by Senators Edgardo Angara,  Heherson Alvarez, Leticia Ramos Shahani, and Congressman Carlos Padilla.\\nThe National Commission for  Culture and the Arts (NCCA), Philippines is the overall policy  making body, coordinating, and grants giving agency for the preservation,  development and promotion of Philippine arts and culture; an executing agency  for the policies it formulates; and task to administering the National  Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA) -- fund exclusively for  the implementation of culture and arts programs and  projects.\\nThe  government’s support for cultural development is particularly highlighted by  the passage of R.A. 7356 that created the NCCA. The  coordination among the cultural agencies was strengthened by the virtue of Executive  Order No. 80, which placed the Cultural  Center of the Philippines , the National Historical Institute (now, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines ), the National Museum , The National Library (now, The National Library of the Philippines ), and the Records, Management, and Archives Office  (now, the National Archives of the Philippines )  under the NCCA umbrella. Further,  through Republic Act No. 9155, administratively attached the earlier  aforementioned five cultural agencies to the NCCA, including now the Komisyon  sa Wikang Filipino / Commission on the Filipino  Language . Thus, the NCCA is responsible for culture and the arts in  the Philippines --- and, if not in the name, the de facto Ministry  of Culture.\\nThe  Commission together with the six cultural agencies works with the principle of  partnership, collaboration and shared responsibility in achieving effectively  and efficiently the implementation of cultural programs as well as maximizing  of resources.\\nThe NCCA was created to serve as the presidential  inter-agency commission to coordinate cultural policies and programs.\\nIV.

      "[0.00015072387266104953, 'Jose Rizal       dedicated his novel, \"El Filibusterismo\" to the three       priests, Mariano Gomez, 85 years, Jose Burgos, 30, and Jacinto       Zamora, 35, executed at Bagumbayan Field on February 17, 1872.\\nHistory books state that with this tragic       event, Philippine nationalism was born. The assumption is that,       before this date, the people did not feel they were one nation,       and any sign of protest against the foreign presence that was       Spain was a localized act of rebellion to which the rest of the       country did not relate.\\nThe execution of three Filipino       priests, one of them an octogenarian, for something nobody believed       they had anything to do with in the first place, stirred a current       of sympathy for the martyrs and of revulsion against the alien       rulers who could bring the ax down on the necks of the innocent.       After three and a half centuries of foreign domination characterized       by unenlightened government, outright exploitation of people       and natural resources, now and then half-hearted attempts at       reform and, on the part of the governed, sporadic and desultory       shows of resistance, the common enemy now took shape and the       people felt as one in their fight for the right to rule themselves,       shape their own destinies, and take the consequences.\\nFather Gomez, Father Burgos and Father       Zamora were summarily tried and sentenced to death by the garrote       for the Cavite arsenal revolt of January 20, 1872. The priests,       who were active in the fight for the secularization (or, in effect,       nationalization) of the clergy were creating trouble for the       despotic Governor Rafael Izquierdo and the powerful regular religious       orders in the country. By linking them with the uprising in the       Cavite arsenal, whether they indeed had anything to do with it       or not, the administration found a convenient way of doing away       with the troublesome trio.\\nWere the three really involved in the uprising?       Establishing the truth of the case will take painstaking investigation       since the records of the trial have disappeared and the star       prosecution witness himself had been ordered executed along with       the three against whom he testified. The question will probably       remain one of the great unsolved mysteries in the Filipinos\\'       fight for freedom. Until he breathed his last, Father Burgos       protested innocence of the crime imputed to him and Rizal, in       dedicating the Filibusterismo to the three condemned men,       underscored the doubt shared by the Filipinos over their guilt.\\nMsgr. Meliton Martinez, Archbishop of Manila,       was served a copy of the death sentences with a request that       the priests be defrocked. In reply, the archbishop said he needed       more convincing proof of their guilt and refused to be instrumental in effecting the crowning touch to their humiliation.\\nThe secrecy which shrouded the alleged       trials, the mysterious way records and papers of the court martial       findings had disappeared, and the suspicious haste with which       the sentences were carried out, contributed to the widespread       belief that the three had been condemned on trumped-up charges.       Sentenced to death on February 15, they were led to the garrote       two days later, on February 17.\\nBut even if irrefutable evidence against       Father Gomez, Burgos and Zamora had been cited, the three \\xad one an octogenarian known for the charities, another turned half-crazed       at the prospect of a ghastly death, and the third widely admired       for his courageous espousal of the rights of the Filipinos, in       particular the clergy \\xad would just the same have been looked       on as martyrs by their compatriots. The time was ripe for revolt       and the fact that the people believed that the executions were       a miscarriage of justice only hastened the march of history.       Public indignation rose to a peak. The job became easier for       those who had by now seen the necessity of uniting. The first       seeds of nationalism were sown and took root. The then constituted       authorities, in deciding to set the priests up as an example       to the populace of what was in the store for them if they continued       being insolent, were fast sealing their doom. The groundwork       for the inevitable revolution that was to come a quarter of a       century later was laid.\\nEdmund Plauchut, a Frenchman residing in       Manila at the time of the revolt, gives a dispassionate account       of it and its causes in an article published in the Revue       des Deux Mondes in 1877. He traced the immediate cause to       a peremptory order from the governor, Izquierdo, exacting personal taxes from the Filipino laborers in the engineering and artillery       corps in the Cavite arsenal, and requiring them to perform forced       labor like ordinary subjects. Until then, these workers in the       arsenal had been enjoying exemptions from both taxes and forced       labor. January 20, the day of the revolt, was payday and the       laborers found the amount of taxes as well as the corresponding       fee in lieu of the forced labor deducted from their pay envelopes.       It was the last straw. That night they mutinied. Forty infantry       soldiers and twenty men from the artillery took over command       of the Fort of San Felipe and fired cannonades to announce to       the world their moment of triumph. It was a short-lived victory.       Apparently, the mutineers had expected to be joined by their       comrades in the 7th infantry company assigned to patrol the Cavite       plaza. They became terror-stricken, however, when they beckoned       to the 7th infantry men from the ramparts of the fort and their       comrades did not make any move to join them. Instead, the company       started attacking them. The rebels decided to bolt the gates       and wait for morning when support from Manila was expected to       come.\\nBut Manila was quiet. What the Cavite rebels       had mistaken for a pre-arranged signal for the uprising coming       from the general direction of the city, turned out to be the       burst of rockets in celebration of the feast of St. Loreto, patron       of Sampaloc. Augustinian Friar Casimiro Herrera, writing a thesis       on the revolt later, was to say this was an \"act of Divine       Providence\", for the Sampaloc fiesta, traditionally celebrated       in December, had been postponed to January 20 that year.\\nInformed of the mutiny, Governor Izquierdo       dispatched two infantry regiments and an artillery brigade with       four cannons, under the command of General Felipe Ginoves Expinar.       General Ginoves arrived in Cavite by sea on the boats of Filipino,       Manila, Isabel I and Isabel II, to find the 7th infantry company       under the command of Lt. Col. Sawa successfully keeping the rebels       at bay in the front. From then on, it was just a matter of hours       before the mutineers, out-numbered, out-armed and ill-prepared       even in the matter of provisions to enable them to weather a       siege, began filing out of the fort waving the white banner of       surrender. But the first to march out were met by a volley of       shots from General Ginoves\\' men. They fell to a man and Gen.       Ginoves then ordered a charge into the fort. The rebels inside       the fort did not offer any resistance. Plauchut mentions a Spanish       friar (Father Antonio Ruffian of San Jose de Dios) whose presence       inside the fort \"has never been explained to date\",       as well as the Filipinos and the suicide of one of them. This       would tend to corroborate reports from other sources that the       Spanish officers in the fort as well as the men under them had       joined with the laborers in the revolt. These reports mention       Spanish Lts. Montesinos and Morquecho, who with a Sgt. Lamadrid,       took charge of the force of 200 marines and artillery men at       the arsenal. When General Ginoves and his soldiers arrived, it       was Sgt. Lamadrid who first tried to repel them. He died in the       attempt. Other accounts, however, conflict with these reports.       They state that the rebels themselves put to death the Spanish       officers inside the fort, as well as the wife of one of them       and her maid.\\nThat those who staged the revolt in the       San Felipe fort were counting on help from comrades in other       military establishments in Cavite and Manila is highly plausible.       The native soldiers in these establishments had long been chafing       from discrimination in treatment. One of Governor\\'s Izquierdo\\'s       first acts on taking over the reins of the government was to       order the fusion of the two artillery battalions in Manila. One       of these was composed of Spaniards (peninsulars) and the       other of mestizos and Filipinos. Before the fusion, the two battalions       were being maintained separately and independently of each other       to avoid clashes that would arise because of the differences       in race. Governor Izquierdo not only ordered the two merged,       but decreed that the peninsulars would form the first       companies and the Filipinos, second. He also filled all vacancies       for the posts of corporals and sergeants with Spaniards. When       the two battalions were being maintained separately, the natives       were blissfully unaware of the fact that their Spanish comrades       in other battalions were getting better pay and better food.       With the merger, the discriminations became obvious. The feeling       of discontent spread. The Cavite uprising was one of the manifestations       of this dissatisfaction over conditions in the army. It could       very well have been part of a concerted plan to revolt among       the native elements in the rest of the military establishments.\\nWhen he quickly quelled the revolt, Governor       Izquierdo demonstrated the futility of mutiny. He should have       rested on his laurels, assured that the other discontented groups       contemplating similar acts of defiance would have learned their       lesson and desisted from resorting to violence. But Governor       Izquierdo had to turn the incident into a terrible example that       the insolent filibusters (as anyone who showed any radical tendencies       was then called) should never forget. Apparently, Governor Izquierdo       had a dossier on who the filibusters were. He had them all rounded       up, their homes searched thoroughly and their letters intercepted.       The Council of War set up a court martial under Manuel Boscasa.       Some seventy people were condemned to death. Later, several of       the death sentences were commuted to exile or imprisonment. Among       those banished to far off and lonely Marianas Islands were Antonio       Maria Regidor, Maximo Paterno. Agustin Mendoza and Joaquin Pardo       de Tavera. Given jail terms were Maximo Inocencio, Enrique Paraiso       and Crisanto de los Reyes. Doomed to the garrote were the three       priests, Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, as well as one Francisco       Saldua. The latter had been the principal informer against the       three priests. His statement had been the main basis for the       convictions and he had been promised pardon in exchange for his       testimony. To his consternation, however, he was condemned along       with the three. His was the first of the heads to roll on February       17.\\nThe court martial proceedings appear to       be highly anomalous. Evidence to support the charges did not       accompany the decision which merely stated that the court had       found them guilty of conspiring to overthrow the government and       proclaim a Republic of the Philippines, with Father Burgos as       president. The defendants were given a counsel chosen by the       court. The counsel, a Dr. Jose Arrieta, on reading his brief,       said it was not possible to defend Father Burgos because he had       already confessed. The priest was surprised on hearing the \"defense\".       He protested, \"That is not my defense. The course has changed       it. I have not confessed and I deny every charge brought against       me as having no foundation in fact or in act.\"\\nThat Governor Izquierdo committed a blunder       when he had the priests executed and the other suspects exiled       or otherwise sentenced for scarcely proved complicity in the       Cavite revolt, is something that most historians admit. If Governor       Izquierdo had desisted from such punitive action, the revolt       would not have attained the importance it was to take on subsequently.       One may not guarantee, however, that otherwise, the fire of nationalism       would not have caught on and spread. As it happened, with the       execution of the three priests, Governor Izquierdo was merely       setting the pattern for his reign of terror, only too well known       in Philippine history. The fuse was ready, all that remained       to be done was set it off.\\nAbroad, events had in fact been working       up to the Cavite revolt. Spain herself had just undergone a revolution.       Four years earlier, in 1868, the queen had been dethroned and       a Republican had been installed. The revolution in the mother       country had repercussions in the Islands. In 1869, the liberal       Governor de la Torre was sent over. All progressive-minded elements       in the country were to enjoy a brief spell of liberalism under       the new governor. There was going to be freedom of speech and       the Governor even encouraged his subjects to visit with him at       his Sta. Potenciana palace and exchange views on how the government       should be run. The loss of Spanish colonies in the Americas at       about this time resulted in the displacements of a great number       of government officials and employees. These were soon to find       their way to the only colony left, the Philippine Islands. The       opening of the Suez Canal was to facilitate this influx of newcomers       who were to bring with them modern ideas of government and the       spirit of reforms then pervading in the mother country as well       as throughout Europe and the new world.\\nOne articulate       historian writes of the period. Not until the nineteenth century       would the Filipino nation present a united, self-conscious front.       The rarefied air from Europe had found its way into the nipa       hut. The red beret of the liberated Frenchman had its counterpart       in the red ribbon worn by the Señora Maria de Sanchez,       hostess of the Manila celebration of the new Spanish constitution.       Pouring in lieu of the invalid wife of the liberal Governor de       la Torre, she presented a strange, exciting sight to the heretofore       repressed Filipino. On the ribbon wound around her hair were       printed the words \"Long Live the Sovereign People\" and around her neck a red tie bore the message \"Long Live       Liberty\" at one end, and \"Long live General la Torre\" on the other. On a frivolous ribbon around a Castillian señora\\'s       hair was the slogan that would send many a Filipino who was present       at the reception, among them Father Jose Burgos, to jail or to       the garrote.\\nBut liberalism was not going to last long       in Spain, and certain circles in the Islands, who looked on the       radical ways of Governor de la Torre as a serious threat to their       existence, were going to conspire to have him removed. These       circles were typified by the Augustinian friar, Herrero, who,       assuming an \"I told you so\" attitude in his thesis       on the Cavite revolt, was to say later, \"The insurrection       at Cavite has the same origin and result as those in France,       Spain, Italy, American and other European countries. They are       all fruits of the corruption of the intelligence and of the heart       . . . The freedom to think and the freedom of the press which       brought bitter fruits in Spain were transported to these islands       and they were encouraged by ambition, passions and ignorance       of men . . . \"\\nOn April 4,, 1871, De la Torre was replaced       by Izquierdo. The moment the new governor took over the reins       of government, he made it clear that the regime he was going       to establish was one of total reaction to De la Torre\\'s liberal       policies. But the seeds of liberalism and of desire for reform       had been sown and these were to thrive, even more so, under Izquierdo\\'s       oppressive rule. It is a lesson of history that revolutionary       movements feed on tyranny.\\nFather Burgos, then a coadjutor in the       Manila Cathedral, had been very active in the fight for the retention       of Filipino curas in parishes. This dispute over parishes       between the seculars (the curas) and the regulars (members of       religious order) is best explained in a letter Archbishop Martinez       of Manila sent the Regent of the King in Madrid at the height       of the dispute, shortly before the Cavite revolt. The archbishop,       as head of the parishes, naturally sided with the seculars and       warned that the controversy had better be resolved to their satisfaction       if it was desired to stave off a deterioration of the situation       with unfortunate results. Because the seculars were native priests, mestizos or creoles, and the regulars were peninsulars,       the dispute over the parishes was eventually to take on racial       overtones.\\nArchbishop Martinez traced the beginnings       of the religious question to the issuance of the Cedula of July       8, 1826. This ecclesiastical order emanation from Madrid authorized       the transfer of administration of the parishes in the Islands       from the seculars to the regulars. The seculars had been occupying       these parishes since fifty years ago, when there was a shortage       of priests from Spain. Few of the Spanish priests like the idea       of coming to the wilds of the Philippines, and the local church       authorities were forced to train natives to become priests and       administer the parishes. The 1826 cedula naturally affected the       seculars adversely, since then they were to be demoted to mere       auxiliaries and sacristanes while the friars were to take       over as heads of the parishes. In almost all instances, however,       there was virtually no transfer of work: the native priests still       carried on the actual work of the curas, while the friars,       enjoying the privileges of curas, only took charge of       the soft job of receiving the moneys due the curates from the       parishioners. A second Cedula issued on March 9, 1849, authorized       the transfer of seven specific parishes in Cavite from the seculars       to the regulars. The last straw was the Royal Order of September       10, 1861 giving all curates in Cavite and Manila to the members       of the Recollect Order. The Royal Order was issued to recompense       the Recollects for loss of benefices in Mindanao which had been       given to the Jesuits, just returned from exile. The Jesuits,       banned from Spain and the Indies (the Philippines included) in       1767, were restored to favor in 1861. There were limited to missionary       work, however, and in the Islands were assigned to Mindanao,       then in the administration of the Recollects. To compensate the       Recollects, they were awarded the lucrative parishes in Manila       and Cavite at the expense of the native clergy which had hitherto       been holding them.\\nThere were other instances of what the       historians of the time called despoliation, which was the awarding       of lush plums to favored parties to the discrimination of underdogs.       When the priest of San Rafael, Bulacan, a native, died, his curate       was given over to the Augustinians. Curates of Zambales, Bataan       and Pampanga, long held by native priests, were given over to       religious corporations. Father Burgos led the protests against       what he charged were intrusions on the part of the regulars into       what properly and legally belonged to the local clergy. He organized       a clerical party to fight for secularization. The party subsidized       the newspaper El Eco Filipino, published in Madrid, which       became the organ of the champions for secularization of the churches       and later of civil reforms. Burgos and his followers argued that       the turning over of the parishes to the regulars contravened       the provisions of the Council of Trent agreement which expressly       prohibited the friars from holding curates. Under the Trent agreement,       only secular priests were supposed to hold parishes and administer       the spiritual needs of the populace while regulars were to live       in their monasteries and devote their time to religious contemplation       and to missionary and educational work.\\nThe regulars on the other hand countered       that the seculars were not competent to hold the parishes and       that, moreover, they had been holding these curates at the indulgence       of the Crown in Madrid which had the right to take away at its       pleasure. What really made the curates such a big bone of contention,       besides of course the fact that they were good sources of revenues,       was the fact that those holding them became spheres of influence,       social and political, in the communities. The regulars, realizing       that they would be reduced to political impotence if they retired       to their monasteries, refused to give up the parishes that they       had maneuvered to get from the native priests through high-powered       and obviously successful lobbying in Madrid. It was this friar       faction which believed to have insisted on laying the extreme       penalty for Father Burgos, his fellow cura del sagrario in the Cathedral, Jacinto Zamora, and the octogenarian Gomez,       for complicity in the Cavite Revolt. In one fell swoop, they       would do away with an annoying threat to the comfortable positions       they had been able to wangle from Madrid, as heads of the most       lucrative parishes in the Islands.\\nBut the stories circulated that the evidence       against the three priests had been fabricated, and that in fact       the revolt had been instigated by the friars (Friar Ruffian\\'s       presence in the besieged fort San Felipe was never satisfactorily       explained) to frame up Burgos, Gomez and Zamora. One take (noted       in Blair and Robertson\\'s The Philippine Islands Vol. 11)       was that some friars had brought from Zambales a native who looked       like Father Gomez, rigged him up in priest attire and thus managed       to implicate the good man in the mutiny.\\nThese stories were to serve as fodder to       the steadily growing fire. Because those put to the garrote for       a crime never satisfactorily proved included a creole (Burgos),       a half-Chinese (Zamora) and a pure-blooded Tagalog (Gomez), the       various elements represented by these three races, saw in the       unjust execution a common cause which was not just creole, or       mestizo, or indio (as natives were then deprecatingly termed).       Up to then, these various groups had held each other in distrust,       a result of the \"divide and rule\" policy maintained       by most despotic regimes and so successfully practiced by the       peninsulars in the Islands. With the executions, Burgos, Zamora       and Gomez emerged as martyrs. The various active groups became       bound in anger over the atrocity and on this union was laid the       foundation for a Filipino nation. Some of the liberal elements       had been advocating mere assimilation with Spain (the country       to take on the status of a province). Now they were asking themselves       whether assimilation, and not complete independence to run their       lives and their country, was what they wanted.\\nAustin Craig in his Lineage, Life and       Labors of Rizal recalls that Father Burgos\\' ante mortem advice       to the Filipinos was for them to seek education abroad because       only through education could they hope for progress. It was advice       that was well taken. Rizal, whose older brother, Paciano, was       a close friend of Burgos, was soon to leave his native shores       for Madrid and other points overseas, where he was to crystallize       his ideas for reform.\\nMeantime,       the laymen who had also been implicated in the revolt and punished       with exile to the Marianas, were to escape to places like London,       Hongkong and Tokyo, where the air was much more progressive.       Here they were to start Filipino communities where many a plot       to liberate the \"patria adorada\" was very likely hatched.       Some of these exiles were to return to their country, and their       contact with liberally-run governments was to open their eyes       wide to the despotism in Manila. These were the men destined       to take historic roles in 1898.\\n\\xa0\\n', 74]\n",

Broad-based economic expansion was achieved in a low inflation environment,\" it said.\\nHefty remittances, which encouraged robust domestic consumption, along with steadfast growth in farm output, compensated for slower exports, economists said.\\n\"We had a very strong first half last year. It has slowed a bit in the second half on uncertainty over the US economy, but robust dollar remittances sustained the growth story,\" said Jonathan Ravelas, an economist at Banco de Oro-EPCI Inc.\\nFrom January to November, dollar remittances by Filipinos working abroad rose 14.1 percent from a year before to $13.1 billion.\\nThe central bank expects remittances coursed through banks to hit $14.3 billion in 2007, 10.8 percent more than the $12.9 billion sent home in 2006.\\nRemittances peak before Christmas as more than eight million Filipinos overseas send more money to their families at home to spend for the holidays.\\nThese inflows are also strengthening the peso, which last year gained 18.8 percent against the US dollar.\\nSTURDY FARM SECTOR\\nThe economy was also boosted by a resilient farm sector, which endured a prolonged dry spell to record 4.7 percent growth, within government\\'s projected growth range of 4.5-5.0 percent.\\nAgriculture accounts for about a fifth of the domestic economy.\\nThe government said agriculture grew 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, faster than the 1.6 percent expansion a year before. The boost came from a late surge in production of rice and corn, the country\\'s major food crops.\\n\"Domestic demand continued to be strong in the last quarter. We expect strong agriculture growth to be the supply-side driver of GDP growth,\" said Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING.\\nThe typical acceleration in exports in the last quarter \"is likely to make net exports less of a drag in GDP growth,\" he said.\\nIn the first 11 months of last year exports rose just 4.8 percent from a year before. The reduced target for the whole year is 8 percent.\\nElectronics exports, which accounted for 61.3 percent of total export earnings in November, fell to 2.42 billion dollars from 2.54 billion dollars a year earlier.\\n\"The steady appreciation of the peso has been hurting the competitiveness of Philippine exports,\" said David Cohen, chief economist at Action Economics Asia in Singapore.\\n\"As a result, China and other Asian exporters are getting more of the export activity.\"\\nWhile the economy breezed though the tumult in the financial markets last year, there will be more headwinds in 2008, some economists said.\\n\"The external environment will be quite challenging. We are seeing a modest deceleration of the economy as a result of slower export growth, a softening of domestic consumption partly due to rising inflation and partly due to a gradual deceleration of remittance growth,\" said Frederic Neumann, an economist of HSBC in Hong Kong.\\nHSBC is projecting 5.9 percent GDP growth in 2008.\\nBut the country\\'s improving fundamentals should cushion some of the external shocks, Neumann said.\\n\"What is remarkable, unlike previous downturns, is that the Philippine economy\\'s sound fundamentals will enable it to better ride out his year\\'s tough environment.\"\\nLOWER EXPORTS\\nEconomists agree that a recession in the US will be a drag on the Philippine economy.\\nThe Philippines, despite having diversified its export markets, still considers the US its main trading partner.\\n\"Exports will likely struggle in the first half as demand for electronics could exhibit a downturn on the back of slowing consumer demand, a consequence of the weakness in the US which, if it continues, will also hit the global economy,\" said Neumann.\\nAside from being a key export market, the US is also home to the lion\\'s share of overseas-based Filipinos who send money home.\\n\"A weakness in global demand will shrink the growth in remittances. It will take a bit of the steam out of remittance growth,\" said Neumann.\\nOther economists have a more positive view.\\n\"The picture is cloudy, but the recent moves by the US government and the Fed should make an impact in the coming months,\" said Cohen of Action Economics.\\nThe Philippine government\\'s push for increased spending this year should mitigate the effects of a global economic downturn, said Ravelas of Banco de Oro-EPCI.\\n\"Fiscal pump-priming activities should help temper the uncertainty because of increased global risks,\" he said.\\nThe peso\\'s strength, the government\\'s healthier finances, a credit rating outlook upgrade and low interest rates should also reduce the vulnerability of the economy.\\nMoody\\'s said Friday its outlook for the Philippines\\' key credit ratings and ceilings has been upgraded to positive from stable because of progress in stabilizing public-sector finances and the government\\'s easing dependence on external financing. Consequently, Moody\\'s also upgraded the outlook for its ratings for eight Philippine banks to positive from stable.\\nThe following are the forecasts for fourth-quarter, 2007 and 2008 GDP growth given by five economists.\\n-- Action Economics - 6.3 percent, 6.9 percent, 5.5 percent\\n-- Banco de Oro-EPCI - 6.5-7.0 percent, 6.5-7.0 percent, 6.5-7.0 percent\\n-- CIMB-GK - 5.8 percent, 6.7 percent, 5.1 percent\\n-- HSBC - 6.4 percent, 6.9 percent, 5.9 percent\\n-- ING Bank - 6.5 percent, 7.0 percent, 6.2 percent\\nCopyright 2011 Thomson Financial.

In 2010, the initiative would need at least P600 million, said a DepEd budget report.\\nCiting the �marked expansion� of the Madrasah, Manaros Boransing, DepEd undersecretary for Muslim affairs, told the recent 5th Mindanao Educators� Congress in Butuan City that �finally, Muslims have a sense of belonging.�\\nHe said: �Before they felt they were only citizens of Mindanao. Along with the lumads and Christians, they now consider themselves citizens of the Philippines.�\\nIn many Muslim schools, �there is no unified curriculum. Many asatidz (teachers) are not professionally trained. Learning materials are insufficient. The quality of instruction is poor. Less than 20 percent of Muslim children are enrolled in the Madrasah. Many Muslim private schools are not recognized by the government,� Boransing said.\\nA DepEd report Boransing furnished the Philippine Daily Inquirer stated that �for years, Muslim education in the country has been dichotomized...On one hand are Muslim children in public schools and those in sectarian madaris on the other. The education received by Muslim children in public schools was not entirely sensitive to Islamic values and practices while the madaris did not follow the basic education curriculum.�\\nBoransing said the dichotomy resulted in problems like non-transferability of private madaris students to public schools and vice versa. Graduates of local Muslim schools were not competitive in the local job market because they lacked communication skills in the English language, technical skills and professional competence, he said.\\nBoransing said Madrasah �would provide Muslim children quality basic education that would be comparable with education given to non-Muslim learners.�\\nMadrasah�s basic components are Arabic language and Islamic values (Alive). The program has been adapted to the differing requirements of public schools, private madaris and Muslim out-of-school youth. Alive textbooks and teachers� manuals were developed in 2005 under a World Bank-Philippine government agreement.\\nTo ensure that asatidz have basic competencies in Arabic and Islamic studies, applicants have to pass qualifying examinations.

      "[0.00010787945081891143, 'Tweet\\nIn Filipino Librarian: The Philippines , Von Totanes asks why we refer to the country as The Philippines and not simply, Philippines.\\nAs a child, I once heard a speech of my grandfather in which he said , “The Philippines are your country and the only country God has given you,” and I asked my dad if this was simply a case of bad English. He said no, members of the older generation used the plural because in those days, the country was viewed as a collection of islands: our official name under the Americans was The Philippine Islands.\\nStarting where the revolutionaries of 1896-1898 had left off, the framers of the 1935 Constitution aimed to create a unitary state, one which emphasized the wholeness of the Philippines as a country, instead of the collection of islands referred to by the Americans. To be sure, the Americans themselves began the process of changing the reference to the Philippines from The Philippine Islands to The Philippines, specifically in the Philippine Autonomy Act or Jones Law, which served as the Organic Act or Constitution of the Philippines from 1916-1935:\\n(from the Jones Law):\\nWHEREAS it was never the intention of the people of the United States in the incipiency of the war with Spain to make it a war of conquest or for territorial aggrandizement; and\\nWHEREAS it is, as it has always been, the purpose of the people of the United States to withdraw their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands and to recognize their independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein; and\\nWHEREAS for the speedy accomplishment of such purpose it is desirable to place in the hands of the people of the Philippines as large a control of their domestic affairs as can be given them without, in the meantime, impairing the exercise of the rights of sovereignty by the people of the United States, in order that, by the use and exercise of popular franchise and governmental powers, they may be the better prepared to fully assume the responsibilities and enjoy all the privileges of complete independence: Therefore\\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the provisions of this Act and the name “The Philippines” as used in this Act shall apply to and include the Philippine Islands ceded to the United States Government by the treaty of peace concluded between the United States and Spain on the eleventh day of April, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, the boundaries of which are set forth in Article III of said treaty, together with those islands embraced in the treaty between Spain and the United States concluded at Washington on the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred.\\nThus, what was used for convenience by the Americans was, for the framers of the 1935 charter, a conscious adoption of a new name, with very definite ideas about what the new reference implied:\\nARTICLE XVIII The Commonwealth and the Republic\\nSection. 1. The government established by this Constitution shall be known as the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Upon the final and complete withdrawal of the sovereignty of the United States and the proclamation of Philippine independence, the Commonwealth of the Philippines shall thenceforth be known as the Republic of the Philippines.\\nIn a sense, this was a reversion to “La Republica Filipina” although because of the change in dominant official languages from Spanish to English, the sense is still different. Under the First Republic, we were “The Philippine Republic,” which is more in keeping with the sense of the Malolos Constitution that the Philippines comprised the political union of The Filipinos:\\nTHE REPUBLIC\\nArticle 1. The political association of all Filipinos constitutes a nation, whose state shall be known as the Philippine Republic.\\nThis is an important distinction first pointed out to me by a French historian. According to him, you have to contrast the Malolos definition of the Philippines with that contained in the 1935 and subsequent Constitutions:\\n1935 Constitution: ARTICLE I The National Territory\\nSection 1. The Philippines comprises all the territory ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris concluded between the United States and Spain on the tenth day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, the limits which are set forth in Article III of said treaty, together with all the islands embraced in the treaty concluded at Washington between the United States and Spain on the seventh day of November, nineteen hundred, and the treaty concluded between the United States and Great Britain on the second day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty, and all territory over which the present Government of the Philippine Islands exercises jurisdiction.\\n1973 Constitution: ARTICLE I The National Territory\\nSection 1. The national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all the other territories belonging to the Philippines by historic or legal title, including the territorial sea, the air space, the subsoil, the sea-bed, the insular shelves, and the submarine areas over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, irrespective of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.\\nThe present Constitution:\\nARTICLE I\\nNATIONAL TERRITORY\\nThe national territory comprises the Philippine archipelago, with all the islands and waters embraced therein, and all other territories over which the Philippines has sovereignty or jurisdiction, consisting of its terrestrial, fluvial and aerial domains, including its territorial sea, the seabed, the subsoil, the insular shelves, and other submarine areas. The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the Philippines.\\nAll of the above, 1935 to the present, according to the French historian, are profoundly Anglo-Saxon definitions of nationhood, defining a country according to boundaries and soil. The Malolos Constitution, on the other hand, basically defines national identity and nationhood by blood, which he says is very German and even very French. So it was that, for example, one of the first reforms prior to the extreme phase of the French revolution was to change Louis XVI’s title to King of the French from King of France. The former was leader of a collective union, the latter, sovereign of a personally-owned fiefdom. This is why, also, Louis-Philippe was named King of the French, and Napoleon III, Emperor of the French; to this day, the sovereign of Belgium is King of the Belgians.\\nSo when the framers of the 1935 Constitution in a sense, named their country, a chance Filipinos hadn’t had since 1898, they decided to view their country in the singular and not the plural: my guess is that an attempt would have been made to drop “The” even later on. In 1940, the Coat of Arms of the Commonwealth was briefly changed, the scroll underneath, for one, which had said “Commonwealth of the Philippines,” changed to simply, “Philippines.” Unfortunately the design (very similar to today’s national coat of arms) was unpopular at the time, and the old Commonwealth arms swiftly restored.\\nYou may wonder why, in Constitutional Conventions, there are Committees on Style. Lawyers who require precision of language know the importance of style, and the ability of the framers of Constitutions to be arbiters of proper (or authorized) usage is clearly shown in the decision to refer to the Philippines in the singular instead of the old plural:\\n1935 Constitution:\\nARTICLE II Declaration of Principles\\nSection 1. The Philippines, is a republican state. Sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.\\nAnyway, that is why we say “The Philippines is…” and not, “The Philippines are…”, the continuation of “the” simply being to keep the language mellifluous: simply “Philippines” would be too abrupt in spoken and written English.\\n', 41]\n",

      "[7.767320458961622e-05, \"Christianisierung[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nAls die Spanier 1565 die Philippinen als ihre Kolonie beanspruchten und es somit Neuspanien angliederten, war der Islam noch nicht tief verwurzelt, so dass es ihnen nicht schwerfiel, auch die muslimische Bevölkerung zum Christentum zu bekehren. Außerdem wurde die Christianisierung der Philippinen weitgehend friedlich durchgeführt, unter anderem wurden animistische Praktiken weitgehend geduldet, von denen einige bis heute überlebt haben. Der Buddhismus, der vermutlich neben dem Islam im 16. Jahrhundert die vorherrschende Religion auf den Philippinen war, wurde bald nur noch von der chinesischen Minderheit praktiziert.\\nAngesichts ihrer Niederlage gegen die Spanier im Jahr 1571 konvertierten die Rajahs von Manila, Rajah Sulayman , Rajah Lakandula und Rajah Matanda zum Katholizismus. Dafür durften sie einige Privilegien behalten und wurden ins koloniale Herrschaftssystem integriert. Durch die weitgehende Einbindung der einheimischen Häuptlinge in das koloniale Herrschaftssystem entstand die soziale Schicht der principialia, die als Mittelsmänner und Nutznießer des Kolonialsystems jenes über Jahrhunderte festigten.\\nDer andere wichtige Machtfaktor in der philippinischen Kolonie waren spanische Mönche und Priester. Aufgrund ihrer Rolle in der Missionierung und in den späteren Gemeinden waren sie oft die einzigen Spanier, die eine einheimische Sprache sprechen konnten. Sie lebten im Gegensatz zu den Kolonialbeamten, die nur auf Zeit im Lande waren, mehrere Jahrzehnte im Land. Sie wurden als Vermittler unverzichtbar und somit sehr mächtig.\\nIm Süden der Philippinen war der Islam zum Zeitpunkt der Ankunft der Spanier bereits tiefer verwurzelt, so dass die dortigen Moslems, von den Spaniern Moros genannt, nicht das Christentum annahmen.\\nKoloniale Wirtschaft[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nIn der frühen Kolonialzeit bildete der Galeonenhandel zwischen Manila und Acapulco die wichtigste Einnahmequelle für die Kolonie. Silber aus den Minen der neuen Welt wurde von Acapulco nach Manila verschifft und dort benutzt, um chinesische Waren wie Seide und Porzellan zu kaufen. Da bis zum 18. Jahrhundert nur die Portugiesen mit Macao das Recht hatten, die chinesische Küste direkt anzusteuern, war man auf chinesische Händler angewiesen, die sich in einem eigenen Viertel vor Manila ansiedelten, dem heutigen Binondo, wo sich auch heute die Chinatown von Manila befindet.\\nIm frühen 19. Jahrhundert änderte sich die wirtschaftliche und politische Situation. Mexiko wurde unabhängig, so dass die Philippinen nicht mehr zu Neuspanien gehörten, sondern zum ersten Mal direkt von Spanien aus verwaltet wurden. Der Galeonenhandel nach Acapulco war nicht mehr möglich und wurde 1815 eingestellt. Die Philippinen wurden nach und nach dem Welthandel geöffnet, so dass für Teile der einheimischen principalia sowie Mestizen sowohl spanischer als auch chinesischer Herkunft Wohlstand ermöglicht wurde, so dass einige ihren Kindern ein Studium, oftmals sogar in Europa, finanzieren konnten. Es entstand die Schicht der ilustrados, die durch neue, freiheitliche Ideen aus Europa beeinflusst wurden.\\nReformen und Revolution[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nJosé Rizal, Nationalheld\\nDie erste große Zäsur in der spanischen Kolonialherrschaft auf den Philippinen war die britische Invasion im Jahr 1762 , die bis 1764 andauern sollte. In deren Folge entwickelten sich Aufstände in der Ilocos-Region und Pangasinan. Diego Silang führte einen Aufstand an und es gelang ihm 1763 die bedeutende Stadt Vigan einzunehmen. Er verbündete sich mit den Briten, doch hielten sich diese nicht an ihre Zusagen, so dass er am 28. Mai 1763 ermordet wurde. Seine Frau Gabriela führte den Aufstand fort, wurde jedoch im September verhaftet und ermordet, was als Hinrichtung dargestellt wurde. Im Jahr 1762 brach in der Provinz Pangasinán der Palaris-Aufstand aus, der zunächst ebenfalls erfolgreich war und erst 1765 niedergeschlagen werden konnte. [48] In der Folge dieser Ereignisse wurde vielen Filipinos klar, dass die spanische Oberhoheit nicht ewig dauern könne.\\nVon besonderer Bedeutung für die Philippinen war die Säkularisierungsbewegung innerhalb der katholischen Kirche, die von Pedro Pelaez in den 1850er Jahren begründet wurde. Die Bewegung forderte die Philippinisierung der Kirche und eine Beschränkung der Macht der spanischen Ordensgemeinschaften. Die Bewegung war von liberalen Ideen geprägt, die die Gleichberechtigung von Filipinos und Spaniern forderte. [49]\\n1868 fand in Spanien eine Revolution statt, so dass der liberale Gouverneur Carlos Maria dela Torre auf die Philippinen geschickt wurde, der liberale Reformen durchführte und unter anderem die Pressezensur abschaffte. 1871 war diese Phase jedoch vorbei. Insbesondere die spanischen Mönchsorden auf den Philippinen entfalteten wieder ihre Macht. Am 20. Januar 1872 brach im Fort San Felipe die Cavite-Meuterei aus, die jedoch schnell niedergeschlagen wurde. In der Folge der Meuterei wurden jedoch die Priester Mariano Gómez, José Burgos und Jacinto Zamora inhaftiert. Die spanischen Kolonialbehörden nutzten das Ereignis, um sich unliebsamer Zeitgenossen, die für ihre fortschrittlichen Ideen bekannt waren, zu entledigen. Drei Priester wurden am 17. Februar 1872 hingerichtet, was einen Aufschrei des Entsetzens in der Bevölkerung auslöste und zur Bewegung der Ilustrados führte. Die drei Priester sind bis heute als GOMBURZA ein Begriff im Gedächtnis der Filipinos.\\nIm letzten Viertel des 19. Jahrhunderts wurden die Rufe der Ilustrados nach Reformen immer lauter. Die Bezeichnung Filipino, die früher nur für spanische Kreolen benutzt wurde, wurde auf alle Einwohner des Landes ausgeweitet. Die Propagandabewegung, die aus Europa von philippinischen Studenten und Exilanten betrieben wurde, sowie die kurzlebige La Liga Filipina , die kurz nach ihrer Gründung durch José Rizal in Manila sofort von den dortigen Behörden verboten wurde, hatten zunächst nicht die Unabhängigkeit der Philippinen zum Ziel, sondern Gleichberechtigung der Filipinos und philippinische Sitze in den spanischen Cortes . Doch für einige ging dies nicht weit genug.\\nVon 1896 bis 1898 fand unter der Führung des Katipunan die Philippinische Revolution statt, die in ihrer Endphase praktisch in den Spanisch-Amerikanischen Krieg überging. Im Verlauf der Revolution wurde im Juli 1897 die erste provisorische Republik ausgerufen, die Republik von Biak-na-Bato , und am 1. November die erste provisorische Verfassung der Philippinen verabschiedet, die am 15. November in Kraft trat. Die Republik wurde jedoch am 15. Dezember 1897 wieder aufgelöst mit der Unterzeichnung des Vertrages von Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel zwischen der philippinischen und der spanischen Partei. [50]\\nBereits zu Beginn dieser Auseinandersetzung zwischen Spanien und den Vereinigten Staaten wurde die spanische Flotte durch amerikanische Schiffe in der Schlacht in der Bucht von Manila vernichtet. Ein Großteil des Landes war jedoch zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits unter philippinischer Kontrolle, worauf am 12. Juni 1898 die philippinische Unabhängigkeitserklärung erfolgte, welche weder von der alten noch der neuen Kolonialmacht anerkannt und vom Rest der Welt gar nicht erst wahrgenommen wurde. 1899 folgte die Konstitution der ersten philippinischen Republik .\\nAmerikanische Kolonialzeit[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nDie USA erkannten die junge philippinische Republik nicht an und bekämpften sie im Philippinisch-Amerikanischen Krieg von 1899 bis 1902 massiv. Etwa eine Million Filipinos (20\\xa0% der Gesamtbevölkerung) kamen während dieser Zeit ums Leben, und das Land wurde zur amerikanischen Kolonie. [51] Unterstützung erhielten die Revolutionäre lediglich vom Hongkong-Komitee , das internationale Verbindungen knüpfte und für die materielle Unterstützung der Filipinos sorgte. [52]\\nBereits am 20. Januar 1900 wurde die Schurman-Kommission von US-Präsident William McKinley berufen. Sie sollte Vorschläge für einen Übergang zu einer zivilen Kolonialverwaltung ausarbeiten, diese Ergebnisse wurden im Januar 1901 vorgelegt. [53] Im März 1901 wurde daraufhin der spätere US-Präsident William Howard Taft zum Vorsitzenden der nach ihm benannten Taft-Kommission berufen und auf die Philippinen entsandt, um eine zivile Kolonialverwaltung zu etablieren. Er baute den Obersten Gerichtshof der Philippinen auf, zu dessen erstem Vorsitzenden Cayetano Arellano 1901 berufen wurde, und es wurde ein öffentliches Bildungswesen etabliert. [54] Es wurden auch Vorbereitungen getroffen, um eine Zweikammer-Legislative zu schaffen. Die Taft-Kommission bildete nach Vorbild des US-Systems das Oberhaus und die Philippinische Versammlung das Unterhaus, erste Wahlen zu Letzterer wurden am 30. Juni 1907 durchgeführt und am 16. Oktober Manila Grand Opera House konstituiert. [55]\\n1904 wurde im Süden der Philippinen, der von den Spaniern nie ganz unterworfen worden war, von den Amerikanern die Moro Province gegründet und militärisch kontrolliert. Dadurch kam es zum Moro-Amerikanischen Krieg , der von 1904 bis 1913/16 andauerte und durch den US-General John Pershing beendet wurde. So wurde aus der in spanischer Zeit eher formellen Zugehörigkeit der Moslemgebiete zu den Philippinen eine faktische. Auf der Insel Mindanao wurden große Monokulturen amerikanischer Konzerne angelegt, wie zum Beispiel Ananasplantagen. Es kam in den 1920er und 1950er Jahren außerdem zu staatlich geförderten Siedlungsprogrammen, bei denen Christen aus dem Norden und aus der Mitte der Philippinen in den Süden gebracht wurden. Der heutige Konflikt im Süden der Philippinen hat seine Wurzeln in dieser Zeit.\\nMit Inkrafttreten des Philippine Autonomy Acts 1916 wurde den Filipinos mehr Aufgaben übertragen, dazu löste die Philippinische Legislative das bisherige Parlamentssystem ab, so dass man ab diesem Zeitpunkt von einem halbautonomen Status der Philippinen sprechen kann. In diesem Zweikammersystem waren nunmehr nur noch Filipinos vertreten. [56]\\n1935 wurde eine Teilautonomie für die Philippinen mit dem Ziel der Unabhängigkeit bis 1945 beschlossen. Kurz darauf wurde die Einwanderung von Filipinos in die USA erheblich eingeschränkt. Manuel Quezon wurde Präsident des Commonwealth der Philippinen . Das Parlament wurde auf ein Einkammersystem reduziert, die Nationalversammlung. 1940 verständigte man sich wieder auf ein Zweikammersystem und der Commonwealth Kongress entstand. 1937 wurde das Frauenwahlrecht durchgesetzt und von diesem Zeitpunkt an konnten sich Frauen auch für politische Ämter bewerben. [57] Quezon holte sich später Douglas MacArthur als Militärberater hinzu, der beim Aufbau eigener philippinischer Streitkräfte half. 1941/42 kämpften philippinische und amerikanische Soldaten vergeblich gegen die eindringende japanische Armee (→ Schlacht um die Philippinen ). Am 8. Mai 1942 kapitulierten die letzten philippinischen und amerikanischen Einheiten.\\nVon 1942 bis 1945 wurden die Philippinen im Zuge des Zweiten Weltkriegs von Japan besetzt. Etwa 1 Million Filipinos starben durch das brutale Besatzungsregime der japanischen Armee, etliche Städte wurden in Schutt und Asche gelegt.\\nAm 4. Juli 1946 wurden die Philippinen offiziell in die Unabhängigkeit entlassen. Die USA behielten einige Jahrzehnte lang wirtschaftliche Sonderrechte und militärische Stützpunkte auf den Philippinen und spielen bis heute eine wichtige Rolle in der philippinischen Politik.\\nMediendatei abspielen\\nFilmaufnahmen der Unabhängigkeitserklärung (englisch)\\nNach der Unabhängigkeit galt zunächst einmal die Verfassung von 1935 weiter, in der die Philippinen eine Präsidialrepublik nach amerikanischem Muster waren. Der Einfluss der USA blieb weiterhin sehr groß, unter anderem ließen sich die USA am 14. März 1947 für die Dauer von 99 Jahren die Hoheitsrechte über 23 Militärstützpunkte garantieren. Die Philippinen entsandten wiederum 1951 fünf Bataillone in den Koreakrieg , um den USA zu helfen.\\nGegen Aufstände durch die kommunistischen Hukbalahap , einer ehemaligen Widerstandsbewegung gegen die japanische Besatzung, gab es von den USA Ausrüstung und amerikanische Militärberater, unter anderem der CIA-Agent Edward Lansdale , der später in Vietnam eine wichtige Rolle spielen sollte. Um den Aufstand zu entschärfen, wurde in den 1950er Jahren die Umsiedlung armer Bauern in den Süden der Philippinen verstärkt gefördert.\\nIm Jahr 1963 kam es zu einem Konflikt mit Malaysia , da die Philippinen Sabah als früheren Bestandteil des Sultanats von Sulu beanspruchten. Diese Problematik ist bis heute offen. So verordnete die philippinische Präsidentin Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, dass Sabah nicht als Teil Malaysias anerkannt wird, 2013 erinnerte das philippinische Außenministerium an die Verordnung. [58]\\nAufgrund von Konflikten zwischen christlichen Siedlern und muslimischen Einheimischen kam es in den 1960er Jahren immer mehr zu Konflikten im Süden der Philippinen. 1968 wurden einige muslimische Armee-Rekruten erschossen, die sich weigerten, an einer Geheimoperation zur Rückeroberung Sabahs teilzunehmen. Als Reaktion auf dieses Massaker bildeten sich die ersten separatistischen Bewegungen auf den Südphilippinen.\\nIm Jahr 1965 wurde der populäre junge Politiker Ferdinand E. Marcos zum Präsidenten gewählt. 1971 wurde Marcos als erster Präsident der Philippinen wiedergewählt, wobei die Wahl als solche sehr umstritten war. Im selben Jahr ließ Marcos eine verfassungsgebende Versammlung einberufen, um die veraltete Verfassung von 1935 zu ersetzen. Gegner von Marcos verdächtigten ihn deshalb des Versuches, die Beschränkung auf zwei Wahlperioden umgehen zu wollen. Ab 1970 hatte es Marcos außerdem sowohl mit dem First Quarter Storm zu tun, einer linken Studentenbewegung, die unter anderem seine Amtsführung, den pro-amerikanischen Kurs geißelte, als auch mit einer neuen maoistischen kommunistischen Guerilla, der New People's Army (NPA) und der Alex Boncayao-Brigade (ABB).\\nMarcos-Diktatur[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nFerdinand Marcos\\nIm Jahr 1972 gab es eine Serie von Bombenanschlägen, von denen man heute vermutet, dass sie von Militärs durchgeführt wurden, um Marcos einen Vorwand für das Kriegsrecht zu liefern. Am 21. September 1972 erklärte Marcos das Kriegsrecht, ließ Oppositionszeitungen und -sender schließen und veranlasste die Inhaftierung zahlreicher Oppositioneller. 1973 ließ er eine neue parlamentarische Verfassung ratifizieren. Das Kriegsrecht wurde zwar 1980 aufgehoben und es kam 1981 sogar zu einer Parlamentswahl, bei der aber massive Wahlfälschung vermutet wurde.\\nWährend der Marcos-Diktatur kam es zu massiven Repressalien gegen Oppositionelle. Manche wurden jahrelang in Untersuchungshaft gehalten, unter anderem der prominente Marcos-Rivale Benigno Aquino, Jr. Im Zuge der Bekämpfung der NPA kam es in manchen Provinzen zu Repressalien gegen die Landbevölkerung. Etliche Oppositionelle oder vermutete Kommunisten verschwanden entweder spurlos oder wurden schwer verstümmelt aufgefunden, eine Praxis, die vom Militär „salvaging“ genannt wurde. Unterdessen bereicherten sich Marcos, seine Frau Imelda und seine Freunde, während die Auslandsschulden der Philippinen immer weiter stiegen. Es wurde viel Geld für Prestigeprojekte ausgegeben, unter anderem für eine Herzklinik und einen Filmpalast.\\nCorazon Aquino (1992)\\nAm 21. August 1983 wurde der Oppositionsführer Benigno Aquino bei dem Versuch, das Land am Flughafen von Manila zu betreten, ermordet. Daraufhin entwickelte sich eine breite Oppositionsbewegung gegen Marcos, der dieser mit vorgezogenen Neuwahlen zu begegnen versuchte. Nach der gefälschten vorgezogenen Präsidentschaftswahl vom Februar 1986 demonstrierten mehr als eine Million Filipinos auf der EDSA-Avenue in Manila und forderten Marcos Rücktritt. Die katholische Kirche unterstützte die Demonstranten, woraufhin die Demonstrationen sich über das gesamte Land ausweiteten und als EDSA-Revolution in die Geschichte eingingen. Durch die Weigerung des Militärs, die Demonstration gewaltsam aufzulösen, sah sich Marcos am 25. Februar 1986 gezwungen, in das US-amerikanische Hawaii zu fliehen. Die Witwe des ermordeten Benigno Aquino und Oppositionsführerin, Corazon Aquino , wurde am selben Tag als die neue Präsidentin vereidigt. [59]\\nPolitik[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nAm 11. Februar 1987 trat eine neue Verfassung in Kraft und seit 1987 sind die Philippinen wieder eine Präsidialrepublik . Der Präsident hat weitreichende exekutive Befugnisse. Er beruft das Kabinett ein. Der Kongress besteht aus Repräsentantenhaus und Senat . Es besteht de jure Wahlpflicht .\\nVom 20. Januar 2001 bis zum 30. Juni 2010 war Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (*\\xa01947) Staatsoberhaupt (zuvor Vizepräsidentin); sie wurde am 30. Juni 2004 trotz verschiedener Vorwürfe massiver Wahlfälschungen, die in der Folgezeit noch bestätigt wurden (Tonbandmitschnitt der Fälschungsvereinbarungen, im weiteren Verlauf auch präzise Aussagen von reuigen Mitgliedern der Wahlkommission) erneut vereidigt. Am 18. November 2011 wurde gegen sie ein Haftbefehl erlassen. Ihr wurde vorgeworfen, die Ergebnisse der Senatswahl 2007 manipuliert zu haben. Macapagal Arroyo ist Nachfolgerin von Joseph E. Estrada , der nach Verlust seiner Machtbasis als Folge von Korruptionsvorwürfen und des Drucks von Demonstrationen seinen Amtssitz vorzeitig verlassen hatte. Die erst 2006 durchgeführten Vernehmungen entlasteten ihn jedoch weitgehend und wiesen vielmehr auf einen engen Vertrauten Arroyos, Chavit Singson, Gouverneur von Ilocos Sur, der für seine Geschäfte im Bereich des illegalen Glücksspiels schon bekannt war. Nach einer Verurteilung durch ein von ihm nicht anerkanntes Sondergericht („Sandiganbayan“) gewährte ihm Arroyo ein „bedingungsloses Pardon“. [60]\\nEine sinnvolle Politik war deshalb zwischenzeitlich kaum möglich. Die Regierung musste sich ständig gegen neue Beweise ihrer Illegitimität wehren. Gleichzeitig war sie mit der Abwehr vermeintlicher oder tatsächlicher Putschversuche beschäftigt. Um beispielsweise eine öffentliche Ansprache an das Volk in Manila (SONA) zu halten, benötigte die Präsidentin 2006 etwa 13.000 Polizisten/Soldaten.\\nAm 10. Mai 2010 wurden Wahlen (u.\\xa0a. für das Präsidentenamt) auf den Philippinen durchgeführt. Dabei wurde in hohem Maß auf Computertechnik zurückgegriffen, um keinen Zweifel an den Ergebnissen der Wahl zuzulassen. Gleichwohl wurde die Bekanntgabe des endgültigen amtlichen Endergebnisses auch dieses Mal durch Vorwürfe der Wahlmanipulation überschattet. Techniker der beteiligten Firma haben die einfachen Eingriffsmöglichkeiten an den Wahlcomputern detailliert dargelegt. [61] Am 30. Juni 2010 wurde Benigno Aquino III. als Präsident vereidigt. [62]\\nDie philippinische Politik ist sehr personenbezogen, so dass Parteien keine so große Rolle spielen. Viele philippinische Politiker gehören einer politischen Dynastie an: So ist zum Beispiel Macapagal-Arroyo die Tochter des ehemaligen Präsidenten Diosdado Macapagal oder der Sohn von Ferdinand Marcos, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. , auch Bong-Bong genannt, Gouverneur der Heimatprovinz seines Vaters, Ilocos Norte , und der Sohn des ehemaligen Präsidenten Ramon Magsaysay , Ramon Magsaysay jr. , ist Senator. Popularität und regionale Zugehörigkeitsgefühle zählen oft viel mehr als Sachthemen. In den letzten Jahren sind viele Schauspieler, ehemalige Basketballstars und ähnliche Medienpersönlichkeiten in die Politik gegangen.\\nDie Philippinen sind Mitglied im Sicherheitsrat der UN , ASEAN , APEC und der Lateinischen Union .\\n2006 wurden die Philippinen für ein Jahr in den UN-Menschenrechtsrat (engl. Council on Human Rights) aufgenommen. Eine Wiederwahl ist möglich, allerdings auch eine Abwahl wegen massiver Menschenrechtsverletzungen im eigenen Land. Der im Dezember 2006 in Cebu geplante ASEAN-Gipfel wurde kurzfristig angeblich wegen des Wetters abgesagt. Von der Opposition wurde jedoch auch die Angst vor Massenprotesten gegen Versuche, die Verfassung ohne entsprechende Verfahren zu ändern, angeführt. Anfang 2007 informierte sich der UN-Beauftragte Philip Alston über die umstrittene Menschenrechtslage. Nach anfänglichem Widerstand erhielt er den unveröffentlichten vorläufigen Bericht der so genannten „Melo-Kommission“. Hier wird zum ersten Mal auch von offizieller Seite die Verwicklung des Militärs, besonders des Generals Palparan, in die politischen Morde an Linken belegt.\\nDemokratiesituation[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nSeit dem Ende der Marcosdiktatur hat es immer wieder politische Unruhen auf den Philippinen gegeben, so dass keineswegs von einer stabilen Demokratie die Rede sein kann. Im August 1987 und Dezember 1989 gab es Putschversuche des Oberst Gregorio „Gringo“ Honasan . Im Jahr 2003 kam es zu einer Meuterei von Marinesoldaten unter Leutnant Antonio Trillanes, bei der ein Hotel besetzt wurde. Die Soldaten gaben jedoch friedlich auf und wurden vor ein Militärgericht gestellt. Im Jahr 2006 gab es einen angeblichen Putschversuch, der zur Ausrufung eines Notstandes durch Präsidentin Arroyo und zu einigen Verhaftungen führte (siehe Artikel Putschversuch auf den Philippinen 2006 ).\\nSowohl Arroyo als auch Aquino kamen jeweils 2001 und 1986 aufgrund von Demonstrationen und durch Überlaufen führender Militärs an die Macht, so dass formal gesehen die Rechtsstaatlichkeit verletzt wurde. Im Jahr 2001 kam es zu Demonstrationen und zu Krawallen von Estrada-Anhängern, die die neue Präsidentin durch Militär niederschlagen ließ. Es gab Tote und Verletzte. Bis heute ist die politische Situation sehr stark polarisiert. Die offensichtlich gefälschten Wahlen von 2004 und in der Folge zahlreiche politisch motivierte Morde an „Linken“, aber auch Menschenrechtsaktivisten und Ähnliches haben die Situation zusätzlich erschwert.\\nDie Wahlen 2007 brachten trotz massiver Einschüchterungs- und Fälschungsversuche einen Erdrutschsieg für die Opposition. Der wegen des Putschversuchs immer noch inhaftierte Trillanes gewann ohne jeden Wahlkampf einen Senatssitz.\\nAm 29. November 2007 gelang es den Verantwortlichen des Putschversuches von 2003, während einer Anhörung das Gerichtsgebäude von Manila zu verlassen und sich nach einem Marsch durch die Innenstadt von Makati in einem Hotel zu verschanzen. Angeführt wurde die Gruppe von Antonio Trillanes und dem Brigadegeneral Danilo Lim. Ein Aufruf an Soldaten, sich ihnen anzuschließen, blieb aber ohne Wirkung, und die Putschisten ergaben sich schließlich den Sicherheitskräften, als diese drohten, das Hotel zu stürmen. [63]\\nAm 23. November 2009 kam es in der Provinz Maguindanao zu einem Massaker an Zivilisten, bei dem 57 Menschen ermordet wurden. Das Massaker stand im Zusammenhang mit den Wahlen vom 10. Mai 2010. Der Hauptverdächtige aus dem Ampatuanclan hatte angeblich für die damalige Präsidentin Macapagal Arroyo in den Jahren 2004 (Präsidentschaftswahlen) und 2007 (Senatswahlen, Zubiri) die Wahlen massiv gefälscht bzw. fälschen lassen. Die Opposition bekam jeweils 0 Stimmen.\\nDer frühere Botschafter der Philippinen in den USA, Ernesto Maceda, verweist in einem Beitrag der oppositionellen Zeitung „The Daily Tribune“ vom 11. Dezember 2009 [64] [65] darauf, dass schon zuvor 200 Morde und andere Gräueltaten von den Ampatuans in der Gegend verübt wurden, ohne bisher juristische Konsequenzen zu haben.\\nDer Regierung Arroyo wurde 2006 vorgeworfen, über 800 politisch motivierte Morde nicht aufgeklärt zu haben. [66]\\nDie Folge dieser politischen Situation war, dass in den Präsidentschaftswahlen von 2016 der Kandidat der Partei PLP, Rodrigo Duterte , eine Mehrheit erhielt. Er hatte in erster Linie mit einer drakonischen Verfolgung und Bestrafung der Drogenkriminalität geworben.\\nMinderheitenkonflikte[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nVor der Ankunft der Spanier bestanden die Philippinen aus Barangays (Gemeinden) verschiedener Völker und Stämme, die vielfältig untereinander vernetzt waren. Spanien kolonisierte den größten Teil des Archipels und in 300 Jahren entstand eine Philippinische Mehrheitsidentität. In einigen Gebieten, wie in den Philippinischen Kordilleren mit den Stämmen der Igorot im Norden und den Gebieten der Moro und Lumad im Süden, wurden die Menschen kaum beeinflusst.\\nDie spanische Kolonialzeit prägte die unter ihrer Kontrolle stehenden Menschen: die erlittene Ausbeutung, das feudale Wirtschaftssystem, später das halbfeudale Hazienda-System, die zentralisierte Regierung, die christlichen und spanischen Einflüsse. Und sie schaffte die Minderheiten: die Menschen, die an der Peripherie der wirtschaftlichen, kulturellen und politischen Veränderungen lebten und ihre indigenen Traditionen bewahrten. [67]\\nTerror und Konflikt[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nVor allem im Süden Mindanaos kommt es immer wieder zu bewaffneten Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Rebellen der separatistischen MNLF ( Nationale Befreiungsfront der Moros ), der islamistischen MILF ( Islamische Befreiungsfront der Moros ) und Regierungstruppen. Die MNLF regiert heute die Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (deutsch: autonome Region im muslimischen Mindanao), während die islamistische MILF sich weiter für einen eigenständigen Moslem-Staat einsetzt, der aus den Inseln Mindanao, Palawan , Basilan und dem Sulu-Archipel bestehen soll. Die Abu Sayyaf sind wiederum eine terroristische Gruppe, die durch Entführungen und Anschläge bekannt wurde.\\nIm Zuge dieser Auseinandersetzungen kommt es auch immer wieder zu terroristischen Angriffen, wie etwa den Bombenanschlägen auf den internationalen Flughafen in Davao City im Frühjahr 2003 sowie auf ein Hafenterminal in Davao etwa zur selben Zeit. Beide Anschläge forderten mehrere Todesopfer. Des Weiteren kommt es immer wieder zu religiös begründeten Anschlägen auf christliche Kirchen. Aufgrund dieser Gefährdungssituation wurden unter anderem vom deutschen Auswärtigen Amt in der Vergangenheit mehrmals Reisewarnungen für die Philippinen herausgegeben und es wurde insbesondere von Reisen nach Mindanao abgeraten.\\nEs handelt sich nur oberflächlich betrachtet um einen reinen Religionskonflikt. Eine andere der zugrunde liegenden Ursachen ist beispielsweise das von den Vereinigten Staaten durchgesetzte Landgesetz von 1903, das Christen gestattete, bis zu 23\\xa0ha Land zu besitzen, während der Landbesitz für die muslimische und nichtchristliche Bevölkerung auf 10\\xa0ha begrenzt war. Dieses Gesetz bildete nur einen Baustein einer andauernden systematischen Enteignungskampagne. In den 1950er Jahren wurde die systematische Einwanderung christlicher Siedler nach Mindanao durch die philippinische Zentralregierung in Manila gefördert. Die muslimischen Einwohner wurden damit in ihren angestammten Gebieten zur Minderheit.\\nDiese Faktoren führten letztlich zu einem der größten vergessenen Kriege unserer Zeit: Der Bürgerkrieg auf Mindanao forderte von den 1970er Jahren bis 2002 nach Angaben der Weltbank mindestens 120.000 Opfer, die Mehrzahl von ihnen Zivilisten. Zahlreiche Versuche zu ernsthaften Friedensabschlüssen zu gelangen scheiterten bisher, unter anderem an einer fehlenden langfristigen Perspektive für die Region, die einen fairen Interessenausgleich aller Beteiligten und Betroffenen bietet.\\nAm 27. März 2014 unterzeichneten die philippinische Regierung und die islamische Befreiungsfront der Moros (MILF) das Friedensabkommen zur Schaffung der politisch selbständigen Region Bangsamoro im Süden der Philippinen. [68]\\nEnde Mai 2017 verhängte Präsident Duterte das Kriegsrecht über Mindanao, nachdem in der Stadt Marawi etwa 100 islamistische Rebellen Angriffe durchgeführt hatten. [69] (Siehe hierzu auch: Schlacht um Maute 2017 ). Dieser Konflikt führte zu einem stärkeren Engagement Chinas, das der Regierung Duterte im Sommer 2017 Militärhilfe im Wert von mehreren Millionen Dollar zukommen liess. [70]\\nMenschenrechte[ Bearbeiten | Quelltext bearbeiten ]\\nSeit Ende der 1960er Jahre schwelt in den Philippinen ein bewaffneter Konflikt zwischen muslimischen Guerillatruppen (insbesondere MILF , MNLF , Abu Sayyaf ), linksgerichteten Guerillatruppen (insbesondere New People's Army (NPA)), Paramilitärs insbesondere den legalen Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) und der regulären philippinischen Armee. Sämtliche beteiligte Parteien machten und machen sich schwersten Menschenrechtsverletzungen schuldig. Die Opfer stammen mehrheitlich aus der Zivilbevölkerung. Besonders gefährdet sind Umweltaktivisten , Journalisten , Menschenrechtler , Gewerkschaftsvertreter , Kleinbauern , indigene Gemeinschaften und vermeintlich linksgerichtete NGOs . Sehr viele Menschen wurden während dieser Konflikte aus ihren angestammten Orten gewaltsam vertrieben, insbesondere aus Mindanao, dort mussten rund eine halbe Million Menschen während der letzten großen militärischen Auseinandersetzung 2008/2009 aus ihren Dörfern fliehen.\\nDie philippinische Regierung verabschiedete 2011 einen „Internal Peace and Security Plan“ (IPSP) oder „Operationsplans Nachbarschaftshilfe“ (Oplan Bayanihan), um die Aufstandsbekämpfung weiter voranzutreiben. Die Erfolge sind jedoch mager, führten vielmehr zu einer verstärkten Militarisierung der Gesellschaft. [71] [72] [73]\\nDie Lage der Menschenrechte verbesserte sich deutlich nach dem Ende der Marcos-Diktatur. Unter der Präsidentin Macapagal-Arroyo (2001 bis 2010) verschlechterte sich die Situation erheblich und erreichte das Niveau der überwundenen Diktaturzeit. Insbesondere erreichte die Anzahl von außergerichtlichen Hinrichtungen und dem erzwungenen Verschwindenlassen einen Negativrekord, dazu kommt die übliche Folterpraxis von Regierungsgegnern. Während ihrer Amtszeit dokumentierte die philippinische Menschenrechtsorganisation Karapatan 1.206 Fälle politischer Morde, 206 weitere Personen wurden Opfer von erzwungenem Verschwindenlassen. Diese Entwicklung wurde von nationalen und internationalen staatlichen und nicht-staatlichen Organisation sowie der UN dokumentiert und scharf kritisiert. Die Interpretationen unterscheiden sich sehr stark zwischen der Bewertung der nationalen Melo-Kommission und dem UN-Sonderberichterstatter.\\nDie wichtigsten Schattenberichte dieser Entwicklung von wichtigen nationalen und internationalen NGOs:\\nAmnesty International (2006): Philippinen: Politische Morde, Menschenrechte und der Friedensprozess.

Doch die in ihn gesetzten Hoffnungen als Sohn der ehemaligen Präsidentin Corazon Aquino und des ermordeten vormaligen Senators Benigno Aquino, Jr. blieben aus, nach wie vor kommt es zu schweren Menschenrechtsverletzungen: Karapatan zählt seit der Amtsübernahme von Aquino III 238 außergerichtliche Hinrichtungen (davon knapp die Hälfte sind Vertreter von Organisationen), 26 Mal erzwungenes Verschwindenlassen und 110 Folteropfer. [84] Weiterhin kennzeichnend für die problematische Menschenrechtslage ist das Klima der Straflosigkeit, die Kriminalisierung von Menschenrechtsverteidigern und dem Red-Baiting von zivilgesellschaftlichen Gruppen (Stigmatisierung als vermeintliche Kommunisten, die verfolgt werden). [85] [86] Die Anzahl an ermordeten Journalisten ist hoch, trotz formaler Pressefreiheit: Reporter ohne Grenzen führen seit 2013 die Philippinen in der Liste der fünf gefährlichsten Länder. „Auf den Philippinen schießen immer öfter Bewaffnete von Motorrädern aus Journalisten auf offener Straße nieder, ohne Strafen fürchten zu müssen.“ 2013 wurden acht Journalisten getötet. [87] Seit dem Massaker in Maguindanao 2009 mit allein 30 getöteten Journalisten sind weitere 33 ermordet worden. [88] Der amtierende Präsident Rodrigo Duterte bekräftigte bereits in seinem Wahlkampf, dass er die Kriminalität auf den Philippinen ausrotten und Drogendealer erschießen lassen will. Er befürwortete auch eine Lynchjustiz gegen Drogenabhängige. Menschenrechtler werfen Duterte vor, zahlreiche Todesschwadronen geduldet zu haben, die Hunderte Drogendealer umbrachten. Zahlreiche Medien berichteten, dass seit dem Amtsantritt von Duterte bereits 465 mutmaßliche Rauschgifthändler umgebracht worden seien. [89] [90] [91] [92] Mehr als 160 Richtern, Polizisten, und Militärs wirft Duterte unter anderem Mittäterschaft vor da sie, laut seinen Angaben, direkte Verbindungen zur Drogenmafia pflegen. In einer Rede, die er am 7. August 2016 in Davao hielt, nannte er namentlich neun Richter sowie mehr als 50 amtierende oder ehemalige Abgeordnete, Bürgermeister und andere Politiker, die angeblich in den Rauschgifthandel verwickelt seien. Auch im Ruhestand befindliche Polizisten und Militärs wurden aufgefordert, sich beim Obersten Gericht oder ihren Vorgesetzten zu melden. In seiner Rede gab er in derselben Weise bekannt, dass er mit zahlreichen Beschuldigungen auch falsch liegen könnte. Der Sekretär der Presidential Communications Group , Martin Andanar , gab bekannt, dass gegen die Verdächtigen ein Strafverfahren eingeleitet werden würde. [93]\\n\", 105]\n",

Dozens of trucks, bearing the logo of a local contractor, lined up at the mine site to cart the stolen nickel ore away.\\n\"The brazenness is incredible,\" Rusina Mining\\'s managing director, Robert Gregory,  said.\\nBy mid-April, more nickel ore had been removed from the property by the illegal miners than Rusina\\'s own operations. Gregory estimates that 50,000 tons of ore, valued at about $4.5 million, had been taken by his unlawful competition.\\nThree other miners, with concessions adjacent to Rusina\\'s in Zambales Province, 250 kilometers, or 150 miles,  north of Manila, had experienced the same fate. Nine container ships had already sailed from the nearby port of Santa Cruz with an estimated 450,000 tons of ore. Another 200,000 tons was waiting on the dock.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nA 2005 decision by the Philippine Supreme Court to uphold the constitutional validity of a law allowing 100 percent foreign ownership of mines should have opened the floodgates of investment.\\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision, the administration of the President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo identified mining as one of the key drivers of future economic growth.  It estimates that  as much as $9 billion in new investment could flow into the industry by 2011.\\nBut miners and mining analysts say the money is still only trickling in to exploration and the opening of new mines. Excessive and slow regulatory procedures, laws that give local governments significant power over the exploitation of mineral resources, the invasion of mining concessions by illegal miners or small-scale mining operators,  and security problems surrounding many mines in remote regions are all blamed for discouraging investment.\\nThe Fraser Institute, one of the leading international mining research groups, ranks the Philippines as one of the five most mineral-rich countries in the world, but, in an annual survey, places it near the bottom of the 65 mining regions and countries as an investment destination, only slightly better than Zimbabwe.\\nThe Philippines government estimates mineral wealth of $1 trillion. It is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after South Africa, and one of the largest copper deposits in the world. It is also rich in nickel, chromite and zinc.\\n\"Philippine resources are among the best in the world,  so miners have to take an interest,\" said Peter Wallace, a Manila-based business consultant, who has written extensively on the country\\'s mining industry.\\n\"But there are other places for miners to put their money, so they don\\'t have to come here,\" he said. \"What we are seeing is small miners come in, take the exploration risk  and then try to sell on to the majors. But we have not had a lot of investment from the majors yet.\"\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nSome major companies, like BHP Billiton and Anglo-American, have carried out exploration, but have been wary about committing to new projects.\\nThe president of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, Benjamin Philip Romualdez,  said that the legal impediments to foreign investment had been resolved, and that  all that remained was for \"companies to work through the process under the mining law to push their investments through to commercial operation.\"\\nMining in the Philippines also suffers a significant domestic image problem.  Mining  in the past has caused serious environmental damage, antagonizing local communities and powerful interest groups, like the Catholic Church, to which 85 percent of Filipinos belong.\\nThe worst environmental disaster occurred in 1996,  when an earthquake caused a drainage tunnel to collapse at a copper mine on Marinduque Island, contaminating a river. A United Nations assessment mission described the situation as an \"environmental disaster.\"\\nThe owner, Marcopper Mining, was a joint venture between Placer Dome, of Canada, and a Filipino businessman. In an attempted rehabilitation, Placer Dome paid $70 million in compensation to affected villagers. The Boac River was considered biologically dead soon after the spillage.\\nThis incident and others hardened attitudes among environmentalists and communities against multinational miners. The Marcopper disaster was followed by a legal challenge to a 1995 mining law that allowed foreign interests to wholly own a mining operation. The effect was to halt almost all new foreign investment in the industry for a decade.\\nNewsletter Sign Up\\nPlease verify you\\'re not a robot by clicking the box.\\nInvalid email address.

Arroyo set up a high-powered committee,  the Mineral Development Council,  to help coordinate policy and respond to the industry\\'s needs.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nMiners say they are particularly concerned by the slow pace at which the government issues mining permits, the lack of coordination between local governments and the national  government and an often poor security situation around mine sites.\\nBut in an interview, Arroyo said the miners  have to do more to ensure they win over the communities in which they operate. She said environmental and community relations problems surrounding some mining projects in the past \"contributes to the skepticism\" of many Filipinos toward mining.\\n\"I want to cut down on red tape, including in the mining bureaucracy, but having said that,  I also want to make sure that we are able to ferret out the responsible miners from the fly-by-nighters,\" Arroyo said.\\n\"It\\'s really very important that we make sure that the mining investor works not only for the company but also for the community,\"  she said.\\nBig miners say it is local communities that have been losing out from the way mining has been managed in the past. A 1991 Small-Scale Mining Act allows provincial governments to issue permits to almost anyone who can afford a pick and a shovel. The small operators in theory sell ore to contractors to ship or refine.\\nBut in practice a lot of small miners are backed by highly organized syndicates. They have used locally issued permits to invade concessions owned by other miners, failed to effectively exploit the mineral wealth of an area, caused environmental damage without cleaning up and paid few taxes back to the communities, analysts and foreign miners say.\\nSome areas, like the Diwalwal gold field on the southern island of Mindanao, have become gun-totting no-go zones.\\n\"Even the police won\\'t go there,\" said Gregory, the Rusina manager. \"Millions of ounces are squandered, recoveries are way down. Money is not spent on communities and pollution and rehabilitation are a problem.\"\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nConcerns over lawlessness have been aggravated because of threats against miners by communist and Islamic insurgents. This year, insurgents with the communist New People\\'s Army threatened to attack foreign mines and  then launched several small raids.\\nThe Canadian miner TVI Resource Development was on the sharp end of that problem in 2002 when 15 local people were killed on their way to a market when two vehicles owned by the miner were ambushed by Islamic insurgents.\\nTVI, which operates a mine near Zamboanga,  in Mindanao,  that has deposits of gold, sliver, copper and zinc, was itself subject to criticism for heavy-handed security and alleged human rights abuses by guards.\\nJohn Risdel, the company\\'s managing director, said a legacy of hostility has been reversed by intense efforts at consultation to win over the local community and the dearming of most of its guard force. It will still rely on the military for some protection, but depends more on the good will of local people to provide information and prevent attacks on the mine.\\nTo help rebut criticism of the human rights record, Risdel hired the former deputy head of Amnesty International in the Philippines as a community relations adviser.\\n\"We have learned so much about the culture and the people of Zamboanga,\" he said. \"We are working with the people and gaining the social license to operate.\"\\nA version of this article appears in print on May 14, 2008, in The International Herald Tribune.

ERIK DE CASTROREUTERS\\nTwitter\\n@iaranau\\n09/05/2016 20:59\\nRodrigo Duterte , el controvertido político de 71 años que ha prometido acabar con la inseguridad y la corrupción en Filipinas, se ha alzado este lunes con la Presidencia del país al conseguir casi el 40% de los votos emitidos, con una ciudadanía que ha optado por un líder visto como fuerte pese al riesgo que su elección implica para los derechos humanos y las libertades civiles.\\nEl que fuera durante 22 años alcalde de Davao, la tercera ciudad de país, se ha convertido en el 16º presidente de esta pujante nación asiática de 100 millones de habitantes, imponiéndose con holgura en una jornada precedida por una campaña pródiga en salidas de tono y acusaciones de todo tipo. El propio Duterte fue protagonista de varios de estos episodios, como cuando se burló de la violación y muerte de una misionera en un motín carcelario, llamó \"hijo de puta\" al Papa en una de las naciones más católicas del planeta o alardeó de su animada vida sexual y su afición por tomar viagra.\\nA falta de contabilizar el 15% de votos, la Comisión Electoral de Filipinas ha informado de que Duterte había conseguido 14,2 millones de votos, un 38,6% del total. En segundo lugar se sitúa Manuel Roxas con el 23%, mientras que la tercera posición es para la senadora Grace Poe, que obtiene el 21%. Además, los 55 millones de electores han decidido este lunes la suerte de otros 18.000 cargos públicos.\\nApodado \\'Duterte el sucio\\', \\'el castigador\\' o \\'el Donald Trump filipino\\', sus detractores han avisado de que su estilo autoritario corre el riesgo de hacer que el país vuelva a convertirse en una dictadura como las sufridas en el pasado. De hecho, el propio Duterte amenazó durante la campaña con disolver el Congreso e imponer un \"Gobierno revolucionario\" si sus reformas encuentran resistencia. \"¿Si soy un dictador? Sí, es cierto\", aseguró en respuesta a las acusaciones de la oposición en uno de sus actos.\\nPero, a pesar de las críticas y las acusaciones, este hombre ha sido capaz de encandilar, con su estilo marrullero y sus promesas de justicia y de reparto de riqueza, a una población harta de ver cómo el espectacular crecimiento que desde hace años vive la economía del archipiélago no se traduce en mejoras tangibles en su vida diaria.\\nEn Filipinas, 40 familias controlan el 76% de la fortuna nacional, y unas docenas de dinastías politicoeconómicas manejan las riendas del Estado desde hace generaciones. Frente a esta oligarquía, Duterte se presentó como un hombre sencillo independiente de la élite gobernante lo que, sumado a sus promesas de mano dura contra el crimen que azota el país, lo auparon hace semanas a lo más alto de las encuestas.\\nDuterte se ha comprometido a terminar con la criminalidad en seis meses, aunque para ello tenga que ejecutar a unos 100.000 delincuentes. No en vano, en sus años como alcalde, al ahora presidente se le relacionó con los escuadrones de la muerte que acabaron a tiro limpio con camellos y violadores de la sureña Davao y convirtieron la ciudad más peligrosa del país en la más segura de todas. \"Olvidaos de las leyes de derechos humanos\" declaró al cierre de su campaña.\"Si llego al palacio presidencial, haré como hice de alcalde. Traficantes, ladrones y maleantes, haríais mejor en iros\" aseguró farruco.\\nSu estilo encaja con una campaña en la que la violencia ha jugado un papel muy destacado, algo por otra parte típico en Filipinas. Durante los meses previos, hasta 15 personas fueron asesinadas en relación con el proceso electoral, y este lunes otras 10 han perdido la vida en diferentes incidentes.\\nAdemás de las deficiencias en las infraestructuras o la arraigada corrupción, Duterte también deberá tomar las riendas del proceso de paz en el conflicto que padece el Sur, mayoritariamente musulmán, desde hace lustros, en el que han muerto unas 150.000 personas en la lucha entre guerrilleros y ejército; o las disputas territoriales que mantiene con la vecina China , cuyas reclamaciones de soberanía en el Mar de China Meridional chocan con las pretensiones filipinas.\\nEn la apretada carrera por hacerse con la Vicepresidencia, Ferdinand \\'Bongbong\\' Marcos Jr., hijo del antiguo dictador y s u esposa Imelda , aventaja en tan sólo 0,2% puntos a Maria Leonor Robredo, por lo que hay que esperar hasta contar el 100% de los votos para saber quién será el segundo en la jerarquía del país asiático.\\nNoticias relacionadas\\n', 132]\n",

Many of its senior figures are clerics.\\nBased in central Mindanao, the MILF has broad popular support in rural areas, where the lack of economic development has encouraged dissent.\\nThe 12,500-strong group was subject to a crackdown in 2000 under the army of then-president Joseph Estrada.\\nRebels groups in Mindanao\\nMILF: 12,000 members, 9,000 firearms\\nCPP/NPA: 3,400 members, 2,300 firearms\\nAbu Sayyaf: 450 members, 350 firearms\\nMisuari followers: 450 members, 450 firearms\\nPentagon group: 200 members, 40 firearms\\nSource: Army intelligence figures 2003\\nBut the mood turned when Gloria Arroyo took power, after Mr Estrada was deposed amid popular protests in 2001.\\nTalks between Manila and the rebels were revived, although they stumbled to a halt a couple of years later when the group was accused of harbouring a gang accused of kidnapping foreigners.\\nMILF was also accused of being behind a bomb blast at Davao City airport in March 2003 which killed 21 people - and multiple murder charges were filed against the group\\'s founder and then leader, Salamat Hashim.\\nBut as 2003 wore on, there were signs of a breakthrough in relations between Manila and the MILF.\\nShortly before his death from a heart attack in July 2003, Salamat Hashim issued a statement renouncing terrorism and underlining the MILF\\'s commitment to achieving a peace settlement.\\nA ceasefire was agreed that year, and both sides have since been engaged in trying to negotiate a peace deal.\\nOne factor which is complicating this process is the allegation that MILF has links with foreign terrorists - including Jemaah Islamiah, the South East Asian group blamed for the 2002 Bali bombings. The MILF denies the claims.\\nDespite the truce, skirmishes continue between troops and MILF militants.\\nIn July 2007, MILF fighters were involved in clashes on Basilan island that left 14 Philippine troops dead, 10 of them reportedly beheaded.\\nMILF said the military had violated the ceasefire agreement by entering its territory without permission, but denied beheading the soldiers or kidnapping the Italian priest which the troops were searching for.\\nAbu Sayyaf\\nAbu Sayyaf is the smallest and most radical of the Islamic separatist groups in the southern Philippines.\\nIt is best-known for a series of kidnappings of Western nationals and Filipinos, for which it has received several large ransom payments.\\nGloria Arroyo restarted negotiations with the MILF\\nIn June 2002, US-trained Philippine commandos tried to rescue three hostages being held on Basilan island. Two of the hostages - one an American citizen - were killed in the resulting shootout.\\nThe group has also claimed responsibility for a series of bomb attacks over the years - including an attack on a passenger ferry in Manila Bay in February 2004 that killed 100 people.\\nAbu Sayyaf\\'s stated goal is an independent Islamic state in Mindanao and the Sulu islands, but the government views the rebels as little more than criminals, and refuses to hold any form of talks with them.\\nAbu Sayyaf - which means \"Sword of God\" in Arabic - split from the MNLF in 1991, under the leadership of Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani, who was killed in a clash with Philippine police in December 1998.\\nHis younger brother, Khadafi Janjalani, took over as leader, although he was killed by Philippines troops in September 2006.\\nNationwide support for Abu Sayyaf is limited, but analysts say many locals in its stronghold areas of Jolo and Basilan tolerate the rebels and even work for them, attracted by the prospect of receiving lucrative ransom payments.\\nBoth the MNLF and MILF have condemned the Abu Sayyaf\\'s activities, and the US has included the group in its list of \"terrorist\" organisations, saying it has links with Osama Bin Laden\\'s al-Qaeda network.\\nUS troops have been helping the Philippines military fight Abu Sayyaf, although they are limited to a training and advisory position as the Philippine constitution bans foreign troops from taking part in actual combat.\\nSince launching a major operation in August 2006, Manila has claimed a series of successes - including the deaths of Janjalani and another senior Abu Sayyaf leader, Abu Sulaiman, also known as Jainal Antal Sali, in January 2007.\\nReports in June 2007 said Abu Sayyaf had chosen Yasser Igasan, one of the group\\'s founders, to succeed Janjalani as leader.\\nBut military chiefs believe Abu Sayyaf\\'s numbers have now fallen to around 200, and they talk confidently of one day wiping out the rebel group entirely.\\nNew People\\'s Army (NPA)\\nThe New People\\'s Army is the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), and has been in existence for more than 30 years.\\nThe group, based on the island of Mindanao, has an estimated 10,000 members according to a presidential adviser on the peace process.\\nGovernment troops have been told to hunt down the Abu Sayyaf\\nPeace talks between the CPP and the Philippine Government stalled in June 2001, after the NPA admitted killing a Filipino congressman.\\nThe CPP/NPA was added to Washington\\'s list of foreign \"terrorist\" organisations in August 2002.\\nShortly afterwards, at a request from the Americans, the Dutch Government cancelled benefit payments to group members living in the Netherlands.\\nMany of the NPA\\'s senior figures, including its founder Jose Maria Sison, live in self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and direct operations from there.\\nUnlike the Americans, the Philippine Government does not class the Maoist group as a terrorism organisation.\\nIn February 2004 a peace process was revived, with representatives of the NPA meeting government officials in the Norwegian capital Oslo.\\nThe two sides agreed a series of measures to move towards a formal peace deal.\\nThese included setting up a joint commission to examine human rights abuses on both sides, and working together for the removal of the NPA from the US and EU\\'s list of terrorist organisations.\\n', 145]\n",

Development of San Vicente, a 13- to 14-kilometer strip of white sand compared to Boracay’s four, is to be led by the private sector, which is currently scrambling over plots of land.\\nTourism’s pocket “ace”\\nThe Philippine tourism industry has become the recipient of greater attention thanks to an effective advertising campaign – “It’s more fun in the Philippines” – boosting arrival numbers like never before. Asian markets remain the fastest growing source of tourists, prompting analysts to purchase interests in the high potential of the sector’s gaming and entertainment segment.\\nAccording to DOT figures, arrivals to the Philippines from Malaysia grew 24 per cent in 2012, followed by the 10.46 per cent increase from Taiwan to 216,500 and 3.86 per cent from Japan to 412,400.\\nTo meet the spike in demand from entertainment-seeking arrivals, four mixed entertainment complexes are slated to come up in the National Capital Region by end-2013, including the Solaire Resort & Casino, a high-end complex in Parañaque City.\\n“Ever since the [It’s more fun in the Philippines] campaign came out, people have been noticing the Philippines a lot more, and coincidentally the gaming industry has been opening better casinos,” Certified Securities Representative Liam Ong at Accord Capital told Inside Investor.\\n“Solaire is opening on March 16, and for now I think that’s the ace in the gaming industry.”\\nThe state-led project will open with 500 rooms, taking on an additional 800 rooms by 2014, and growing to over 2,000 rooms by 2016.\\n\\xa0\\n', 179]\n",

      "[4.167528453269205e-05, \"History\\nHistorical Perspective of the Philippine Educational System\\nEducation in the Philippines has undergone several stages of development from the pre-Spanish times to the present. In meeting the needs of the society, education serves as focus of emphases/priorities of the leadership at certain periods/epochs in our national struggle as a race.\\nAs early as in pre-Magellanic times, education was informal, unstructured, and devoid of methods. Children were provided more vocational training and less academics (3 Rs) by their parents and in the houses of tribal tutors.\\nThe pre-Spanish system of education underwent major changes during the Spanish colonization. The tribal tutors were replaced by the Spanish Missionaries. Education was religion-oriented. It was for the elite, especially in the early years of Spanish colonization. Access to education by the Filipinos was later liberalized through the enactment of the Educational Decree of 1863 which provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town under the responsibility of the municipal government; and the establishment of a normal school for male teachers under the supervision of the Jesuits. Primary instruction was free and the teaching of Spanish was compulsory. Education during that period was inadequate, suppressed, and controlled.\\nThe defeat of Spain by American forces paved the way for Aguinaldo's Republic under a Revolutionary Government. The schools maintained by Spain for more than three centuries were closed for the time being but were reopened on August 29, 1898 by the Secretary of Interior. The Burgos Institute in Malolos, the Military Academy of Malolos, and the Literary University of the Philippines were established. A system of free and compulsory elementary education was established by the Malolos Constitution.\\nAn adequate secularized and free public school system during the first decade of American rule was established upon the recommendation of the Schurman Commission. Free primary instruction that trained the people for the duties of citizenship and avocation was enforced by the Taft Commission per instructions of President McKinley. Chaplains and non-commissioned officers were assigned to teach using English as the medium of instruction.\\nA highly centralized public school system was installed in 1901 by the Philippine Commission by virtue of Act No. 74. The implementation of this Act created a heavy shortage of teachers so the Philippine Commission authorized the Secretary of Public Instruction to bring to the Philippines 600 teachers from the U.S.A. They were the Thomasites.\\nYear\\nSuperior Commission of Primary Instruction\\nChairman\\nAct.

In 1908, the Philippine Legislature approved Act No. 1870 which created the University of the Philippines.\\nThe Reorganization Act of 1916 provided the Filipinization of all department secretaries except the Secretary of Public Instruction.\\nJapanese educational policies were embodied in Military Order No. 2 in 1942. The Philippine Executive Commission established the Commission of Education, Health and Public Welfare and schools were reopened in June 1942. On October 14, 1943, the Japanese - sponsored Republic created the Ministry of Education. Under the Japanese regime, the teaching of Tagalog, Philippine History, and Character Education was reserved for Filipinos. Love for work and dignity of labor was emphasized. On February 27, 1945, the Department of Instruction was made part of the Department of Public Instruction.\\nIn 1947, by virtue of Executive Order No. 94, the Department of Instruction was changed to Department of Education. During this period, the regulation and supervision of public and private schools belonged to the Bureau of Public and Private Schools.\\nIn 1972, it became the Department of Education and Culture by virtue of Proclamation 1081 and the Ministry of Education and Culture in 1978 y virtue of P.D. No. 1397. Thirteen regional offices were created and major organizational changes were implemented in the educational system.\\nThe Education Act of 1982 created the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports which later became the Department of Education, Culture and Sports in 1987 by virtue of Executive Order No. 117. The structure of DECS as embodied in EO No. 117 has practically remained unchanged until 1994 when the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), and 1995 when the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) were established to supervise tertiary degree programs and non-degree technical-vocational programs, respectively.\\nThe Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) report provided the impetus for Congress to pass RA 7722 and RA 7796 in 1994 creating the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), respectively.\\nThe trifocal education system refocused DECS’ mandate to basic education which covers elementary, secondary and nonformal education, including culture and sports. TESDA now administers the post-secondary, middle-level manpower training and development while CHED is responsible for higher education.\\nIn August 2001, Republic Act 9155, otherwise called the Governance of Basic Education Act, was passed transforming the name of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) to the Department of Education (DepEd) and redefining the role of field offices (regional offices, division offices, district offices and schools). RA 9155 provides the overall framework for (i) school head empowerment by strengthening their leadership roles and (ii) school-based management within the context of transparency and local accountability. The goal of basic education is to provide the school age population and young adults with skills, knowledge, and values to become caring, self-reliant, productive and patriotic citizens.\\nDepEd Management Structure\\nTo carry out its mandates and objectives, the Department is organized into two major structural components. The Central Office maintains the overall administration of basic education at the national level. The Field Offices are responsible for the regional and local coordination and administration of the Department’s mandate. RA 9155 provides that the Department should have no more than four Undersecretaries and four Assistant Secretaries with at least one Undersecretary and one Assistant Secretary who are career service officers chosen among the staff of the Department. (See DepEd Organizational Chart.)\\nAt present, the Department operates with four Undersecretaries in the areas of: (1) Programs and Projects; (2) Regional Operations; (3) Finance and Administration; and (4) Legal Affairs; four Assistant Secretaries in the areas of: (1) Programs and Projects; (2) Planning and Development; (3) Budget and Financial Affairs; and (4) Legal Affairs.\\nBackstopping the Office of the Secretary at the Central Office are the different services, bureaus and centers. The five services are the Administrative Service, Financial and Management Service, Human Resource Development Service, Planning Service, and Technical Service. Three staff bureaus provide assistance in formulating policies, standards, and programs related to curriculum and staff development. These are the Bureau of Elementary Education (BEE), Bureau of Secondary Education (BSE), and the Bureau of Nonformal Education (BNFE). By virtue of Executive Order No. 81 series of 1999, the functions of a fourth bureau, the Bureau of Physical Education and School Sports (BPESS), were absorbed by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) last August 25, 1999.\\nSix centers or units attached to the Department similarly provide technical and administrative support towards the realization of the Department’s vision. These are the National Education Testing and Research Center (NETRC), Health and Nutrition Center (HNC), National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), Educational Development Projects Implementing Task Force (EDPITAF), National Science Teaching Instrumentation Center (NSTIC), and Instructional Materials Council Secretariat (IMCS). There are four special offices under OSEC: the Adopt-a-School Program Secretariat, Center for Students and Co-curricular Affairs, Educational Technology Unit, and the Task Force Engineering Assessment and Monitoring.\\nOther attached and support agencies to the Department are the Teacher Education Council (TEC), Philippine High School for the Arts, Literacy Coordinating Council (LCC), and the Instructional Materials Council (IMC).\\nAt the sub-national level, the Field Offices consist of the following:\\nSixteen (16) Regional Offices, including the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM*), each headed by a Regional Director (a Regional Secretary in the case of ARMM);\\nOne hundred fifty-seven (157) Provincial and City Schools Divisions, each headed by a Schools Division Superintendent.

Except for the 1942-45 Japanese occupation during World War II, the Philippines had been under U.S. administration since the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898.\\nThe U.S.-Philippine Bilateral Strategic Dialogue advances discussion and cooperation on bilateral, regional, and global issues. U.S.-Philippine relations are based on strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and human rights. The United States has designated the Philippines as a Major Non-NATO Ally, and there are close and abiding security ties between the two nations. The Manila Declaration signed in 2011 reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty as the foundation for a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. There is also a focus on economic, commercial, and people-to-people ties. There are an estimated four million U.S. citizens of Philippine ancestry in the United States, and more than 220,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines, including a large presence of United States veterans. An estimated 650,000 U.S. citizens visit the Philippines each year. Many people-to-people programs exist between the United States and the Philippines, including Fulbright, International Visitor Leadership Program, and the Kenney-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study program.\\nManila is home to the only VA benefits office and healthcare clinic outside the United States, and the American Cemetery in Manila is the largest American military cemetery outside the United States.\\nU.S. Assistance to Philippines\\nThe U.S. government’s goal in the Philippines is to partner with the country to become a stable and prosperous nation. The 2011 Partnership for Growth Statement of Principles reinforced a shared interest in promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth in the Philippines. U.S. assistance to the Philippines fosters broad-based economic growth; improves the health and education of Filipinos; promotes peace and security; advances democratic values, good governance, and human rights; and strengthens regional and global partnerships. Department of State, Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao aim to strengthen the foundation for peace and stability in the area. U.S. assistance, including from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, seeks to intensify cooperation through a whole-of-government approach, using a wide range of assistance and other foreign policy tools. The United States has had a Peace Corps program in the Philippines for over 50 years.\\nOver the last decade, disaster relief and recovery has also become an increasingly important area of assistance to the Philippines. The United States has provided over $143 million in assistance to date to the people of the Philippines in relief and recovery efforts after Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda devastated the country in 2013. The United States continues to support long-term reconstruction and rebuilding efforts.\\nBilateral Economic Relations\\nThe United States and the Philippines have a strong trade and investment relationship, with over $25 billion in goods and services traded. The United States is one of the largest foreign investors in the Philippines, and is the Philippines’ third-largest trading partner. The Philippines has been among the largest beneficiaries of the Generalized System of Preferences program for developing countries, which provides preferential duty-free access to the U.S. market.\\nKey imports from the Philippines are semiconductor devices and computer peripherals, automobile parts, electric machinery, textiles and garments, wheat and animal feeds, coconut oil, and information technology/business process outsourcing services. Key U.S. exports to the Philippines are machinery, cereals, raw and semi-processed materials for the manufacture of semiconductors, electronics, and transport equipment. The two countries have a bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, signed in 1989, and a tax treaty.\\nThe Embassy is working to advance several key Environment, Science, Technology, and Health issues. The Philippines is an important partner on climate change and submitted an “intended nationally determined contribution” (INDC) prior to the December 2015 COP 21 meetings in Paris. USAID is providing key technical assistance to help ensure the Philippines’ INDC is meaningful and science-based.\\nPhilippines's Membership in International Organizations\\nThe Philippines and the United States belong to a many of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN Regional Forum, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. The Philippines is also an observer to the Organization of American States. The Philippines serves as chair and host of ASEAN for 2017.\\nBilateral Representation\\nThe U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines is Sung Y.

Days are for indulging in such activities as        strolling, biking, and trekking. Evenings are for        campfire chats at a village or warm indoor cosseting at        the lodges and inns.\\nA leading tourism destination in Asia, the Banaue rice        terraces start from the base of the Cordilleras and        reach up to several thousand feet high. Its length, if        stretched from end to end, could encircle half of the        globe.\\nThe rice paddies are fed by mountain springs and streams        that are channeled into an irrigation canal that runs        downhill through the terraces.\\nIn the village of Batad, the terraces take the shape of        an amphitheater and can be reached by a 12-kilometer        ride from Banaue Hotel and a 2-hour hike through        mountain trails.\\nAfter trekking through the terraces, cool retreats indeed are the        spring-fed stream of Guihob and the magnificent Tappiya        Waterfalls which has an enormous basin for swimming.\\nShopping takes a different twist in Banaue. While        souvenir items are offered by curio stores, the more        exciting way to shop, however, is to go on a village        visit, watch a family demonstrate their native craft and        then haggle for a better price on their product.\\nAwesome Hills\\nChocolate Hills is a series of 1,268 perfectly       symmetrical, haycock-shaped hills that rise some 30 meters       above the ground.

And from dusk to      dawn, Boracay turns into one big party place where everyone is      welcome to join in…But first, let\\'s toast that sunset cocktail!\\nDiversions are certainly no problem in this tropical eden with      leisure activities calendared throughout the year and amenities      offered by some 350 tourist establishments.\\nThe Isle of Your Tropical Dreams\\nCebu is the traveler\\'s fantasy of a tropical island come       true - balmy weather, pristine beaches, crystalline waters,       and luxurious resorts with all the frills of modern living.\\nThe island-province of Cebu was where the Portuguese       navigator Ferdinand Magellan planted the Cross of       Christianity in the name of Spain in 1521. But even before       Cebu became the Occidental gateway to the Orient, it was       already a popular entry point among Asian merchants.\\nCebu has since blossomed into a choice tourist       destination, with many leisure establishments taking full       advantage of its sea-valley-and-mountain location.\\nMetropolitan Cebu, the country\\'s second biggest metropolis,       is the political, economic, educational and cultural center       of the Visayas. Hotels, shopping malls, entertainment halls,       casinos and golf fairways are ever present in the metro to       cater to every tourist\\'s whim.\\nThe rest of Cebu\\'s 166 islands and islets are fringed       with sandy beaches and sapphire-clear waters teeming with       marine life, perfect for divers.\\n\\xa0\\nLand of Plenty\\n\"Kadayawan sa Dabaw\" is Davao City\\'s premier festival and       showcases the natural and cultural bounty of the land.\\nA movable feast in August, the week-long merrymaking       highlights the manifold tribal cultures of the region which       are vividly expressed in traditional songs, dances, games       and crafts. It is also on this occasion when a lively trade       fair, capped by a flower-and-fruit float parade, takes       place. Street dancing and popular entertainment complete the       celebration.\\nAgriculture-based industries thrive in the Davao region. A       major exporter of bananas, citrus, mangosteen and other       tropical fruits, it is also the biggest producer of cultured       flowers in the country. Its surrounding waters are rich       sources for commercial fishing.\\nThe world\\'s largest city in terms of land area, Davao covers       all of 244,000 hectares.\\nManila\\nThe capital of the Philippines - its heart and soul -- is       Manila. It sets the rhythm of life in this archipelago and       is a pulsating hub that blends the Oriental with the       Occidental, the quaint with the modern, the mundane with the       extraordinary.\\nManila was born out of the ashes of a once flourishing       Malay settlement by the banks of the Pasig River. In 1571,       Miguel Lopez de Legazpi established the Ever Loyal City of       Manila which, until 1898, was the seat of Spanish colonial       rule in Asia. He built the city within walls and called it       Intramuros.\\nAn anchor tourist destination, Manila is the very core of       the 7,000 times more islands that make up the Philippines.       It is a center for the performing arts in Asia.\\nThe Last Frontier\\nUnique to Palawan is its megadiversity.\\nFor a long time, Palawan\\'s bountiful resources, abundant wildlife and    extraordinary natural beauty are known only to the many ethnic    communities that thrive in these islands and a few other daring settlers    who wanted to live in unpolluted surroundings.\\nThe island-province first attracted foreign attention in the 1970\\'s when    it became a United Nations Vietnamese Refugee Center. At this time, a    disturbance in Kenya also saw the transport of endangered animals from    its savannas to the plains of Calauit Island.\\nHowever, it was only a sea accident in 1979 that eventually led to the    opening of Palawan into tourism big time.\\nAs the story goes, a tuna line disabled a dive boat\\'s propeller in the    middle of the night forcing it to drop anchor in an inlet. The following    morning, the divers woke up to an amazing scenery of skyscraping dark    cliffs, thick green forest, white-sand beach, sparkling water and,    rising above it, a series of magnificently sculpted jade islands. And    thus was how El Nido was discovered.\\nEcology awareness is at a high level throughout the province. Puerto    Princesa prides itself as the cleanest city in the Philippines. To    protect its megadiversity, only eco-friendly programs are adhered to by    tourist establishments. And there are strict ordinances against dynamite    fishing, with only net and line fishing allowed.\\nPalawan may have opened itself to tourism but it has also taken serious    efforts to preserve this last frontier.\\nOld World City\\nVigan, with its centuries-old edifices, is a breathing       reminder of what was once a royal city.\\nOne of the earliest Spanish settlements in the country,       Vigan was founded in 1572 by Juan de Salcedo who patterned       its design to that of Intramuros (Old Manila). It became the       seat of the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia and was called       Ciudad Fernandina in honor of King Ferdinand.\\nToday, Vigan retains much of the patina of 18th century       Castillan architecture as seen in some 150 stone houses       which stand in the town\\'s Mestizo District, notably Mena       Crisologo Street. Many of these ancestral homes are still in       good condition and some have been turned into cozy inns,       museums, and souvenir shops.\\nAlong with the homes are other vestiges of the town\\'s       colonial past:\\nThe majestic St. Paul\\'s Cathedral was built by the       Augustinian friars along the distinct \"Earthquake Baroque\" style of the Ilocos region and features Neo-Gothic and       pseudo Romanesque motifs. Standing on an elevation west of       the cathedral is Plaza Salcedo, the oldest monument in       Northern Luzon. The Archbishop\\'s Palace is a rich repository       of religious artifacts from the Ilocos region. Plaza Burgos       was built in honor of Fr. Jose Burgos, one of three Filipino       priests who were garroted by the Spaniards for espousing       church reforms.\\nBut it is not only edifices which are preserved in this town       inscribed in the World Heritage List. Viganos also remain       steadfast in their traditional crafts, notably pottery       (burnay) and handloom weaving (inabel).\\nThe horse-drawn calesa (rig) is as much a presence in the       streets as motor vehicles.\\nCopyright © 2009\\n', 181]\n",

      "[1.8164436074383737e-05, \"Last Laugh for the Philippines; Onetime Joke Economy Avoids Much of Asia's Turmoil\\nBy EDWARD A. GARGAN\\nContinue reading the main story\\nChristmas roars into the Philippines with sacks of red ribbons and plastic fir trees festooned in frosted and sequined glass bulbs. Streets are lathered in glowing stars, six-foot candles and light displays of Santa's sleigh dashing through the tropical humidity.\\nDetermined not to be left out, the central bank on Roxas Boulevard has draped its office block in a lighted display of its own: four mammoth line charts tracking the country's inflation, foreign exchange reserves, economic growth and the rate on 91-day Treasury bills.\\nMerry Christmas.\\nIndeed, in the Philippines, long regarded as a comedic, boisterously democratic laggard, the turmoil afflicting other Asian economies has left many people feeling a bit merrier than usual at this time of year. The thunder of collapsing banks and the cracking of economic hubris elsewhere are even making Filipinos a bit smug.\\nThe Philippines has been hit by a fall in its own currency and stock market in recent months, yet it has not experienced the more damaging banking and real estate chaos that has afflicted other countries in East Asia.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nUnlike Bangkok and Jakarta, where cranes stand frozen over dozens of abandoned building sites, Manila is a hive of construction; with occupancy rates in the business districts at 98 to 99 percent, the thirst for new buildings remains strong. And while Bangkok's projected light-rail line is just a procession of silent concrete pillars, workers swarm over the site of Manila's new overhead light-rail line, work that has turned one of the city's main arteries, Edsa Boulevard, into a monumental traffic jam.\\nContinue reading the main story\\nThe Philippines has proved the exception mainly because it has not tried to leap ahead as suddenly as its neighbors, taking a conservative tack at least partly mandated by the International Monetary Fund.\\n''There's a bit of truth to the case of the turtle and the hare,'' laughed Washington SyCip, the 75-year-old founder of SGV Group, the country's largest insurance conglomerate, and widely regarded as the dean of the country's financial sector. By moving slowly, he said, the nation did not ''make all the mistakes of our neighbors.''\\nForeign investors, rather than shying away in alarm, as they have elsewhere in the region, are still coming in. Acer, Taiwan's largest computer maker, is building a huge manufacturing center at Subic Bay. Intel, already the country's largest exporter, is expanding its production. And Seagate, an American maker of hard-disk drives, is planning to open a plant here.\\nIndeed, while countries across Asia, from Thailand to Indonesia to South Korea, are begging the I.M.F. to rescue them, the Philippines is toying with the notion of leaving I.M.F. supervision this month after 34 years, having successfully met the fund's targets for economic stability.\\n''We learned our lessons much earlier, and the past five years have been a time of resolute and pervasive correction and reform,'' President Fidel Ramos said during a visit to the United States last month. ''In the Philippines, we have felt the lash of the turmoil, although we have not been guilty of the mistakes'' made by other Asian countries.\\n''The Philippines,'' Mr. Ramos argued, ''has passed third base and is heading for home plate, meaning an exit from our I.M.F. program.''\\nIn a sense, it hardly matters whether Manila leaves fund supervision; the mere discussion of such a step sets the country apart from its neighbors and provides evidence of an economy distinctly better off than the savaged economies nearby.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\n[Indeed, the Philippine central bank announced on Wednesday that its economy is stable enough to allow it to cut its key overnight borrowing rate to 11 percent, the lowest level since the currency turmoil began sweeping through the region in July.]\\nIn some ways. to be sure, the Philippines has mimicked the problems that have sparked the Asian crisis. The peso has plunged nearly 30 percent in value, and the Manila stock market, perhaps because many outsiders fail to distinguish it from its neighbors, has tumbled about 35 percent since July.\\nBut the Philippines has resisted the impulse to erect the world's tallest building, to make a ''national'' car (while imposing high tariffs on competitors), to build a ''national'' airplane or to create a new capital. In short, it has eschewed the hubris that has infected many Asian tigers.\\n''We've gotten away from trying to devise a national car, or steel plant, or an aircraft industry,'' argued Victor S. Limlingan, a senior professor at the Asian Institute of Management, a leading business school. ''We have liberalized the economy. There are virtually no tariff protections. What's saving us is the liberalization program. Growth has spread out.''\\nDecades of I.M.F. supervision have, virtually all economists concur, set the country's economy firmly on rails leading to steady but unostentatious growth. In the last six years, under President Ramos, the Government has divested itself of everything from the national airline to electric power systems, banks to water supplies -- or is in the process of doing so. The Government's budget is in surplus, and sweeping reforms that would simplify the tax code while increasing revenues are on the brink of passage. And unlike Thailand, where banks are straining under a rate of bad loans over 20 percent, Philippine banks boast a rate of only 3.4 percent.\\nNewsletter Sign Up\\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\\nInvalid email address.

''Monetary policy wasn't too bold. And the structure of the economy is not like Thailand, for example, which borrowed huge amounts externally.''\\nMatthew S. Sutherland, head of Philippine research at Paribas Asia Equity, added: ''I don't think we have the systemic problems of the rest of Asia. The property sector is not overblown; banking is not in trouble; there has not been a lot of borrowing in U.S. dollars. We don't need three years of a tighter belt and severe austerity.''\\nAfter the collapse of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, a lot of the flagrant cronyism and corruption he nurtured died as well. And though corruption still exists, the privatization of much of the economy and an increasing openness in economic decision-making have wiped out a fair amount of the cronyism in business and government.\\nIn part, it is from the factories of people like Victoria Reyes that the Philippines is drawing its strength. From a desire to earn enough to carpet her house, Ms. Reyes built a large textile business, Remerco Garments Manufacturing Inc., which at its height employed more than 800 people. And all her production was exported.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nNorth and east of Manila, in Quezon City, in what used to be rice paddies and is now a warren of cement-block-walled factory compounds, Ms. Reyes and her children live and work on land that has been in the family for generations. Under a corrugated roof, with the walls open to the languid humidity of the tropics, 250 women hunch over Taiwan-made sewing machines churning out Chicago Bulls jackets, children's dresses, multicolored flannel jackets and denim children's pants.\\n''Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka are our big competitors,'' Ms. Reyes said. ''Of course China is big, too. In 1980, with China taking off, our European buyers dropped us like a sack of potatoes. But when they didn't get deliveries they came crawling back. I said no.'' In those days, the waning days of Marcos's martial law regime, days when the country's economy was stagnant, Ms. Reyes was one of the top 10 exporters in the Philippines.\\nA strike by workers in 1990 almost destroyed the business, and even Ms. Reyes acknowledged that she shared some blame. ''Our pride got the better of us,'' she confessed. But by 1995,  she was back, buoyed by the firm support of her two major American buyers and a Hong Kong garment house. Today, she said, ''it's a big small operation.''\\nThe operation is more efficient than ever. ''We're doing production levels we had with 600 people,'' she said. Still, as at all businesses in the Philippines, the falling peso and often usurious interest rates have required fast footwork. ''We had about a $1 million loan in pesos,'' explained her son, Rufino A. Reyes Jr., the company's vice president. ''Loan interest was 30 percent. It was too much for us to pay. I went to the bank and said I wanted to swap the peso loan to a dollar loan, since all our income is in dollars. So they did, and the interest rate is now 11 percent -- still high, but we can make it.''\\nWith $7 million to $8 million in sales, Remerco is relatively small next to the electronics giants -- electronics constitute about 51 percent of the total exports of the Philippines -- and competition remains fierce throughout the region. ''Right now we're banking on our long-term relationship with our buyers,'' Mr. Reyes said. ''But we have to be realistic that competition will be more.''\\nAnd with companies from Remerco to Intel expanding, Philippine exports have climbed more than 25 percent in the last year. Many analysts expect foreign and domestic investment to continue to grow.\\n''A lot is going on in industrial zones,'' said Jose Mario I. Cuyegkeng, research director at ING Baring Securities. ''And while we have one of the highest wages in the region, we have the higher productivity. Many people here speak English, and we have one of the cheapest middle-management salary structures anywhere.''\\nFor companies with domestic markets, things are likely to be tougher in the coming year. One tile maker, who insisted on anonymity, explained that with domestic business loan rates so high, he would have to put off his expansion plans for a while.\\nAdvertisement\\nContinue reading the main story\\nThere are already signs that consumer spending is waning. The most recent data available indicate that sales of many larger items began to fall in July, particularly televisions, fans and washing machines.\\nEven so, Roberto C. Benares, who runs a small investment bank here, the Asian Alliance Investment Corporation, said that while he foresaw  more mergers and acquisitions as some companies faced difficulties (there have been almost no initial public offerings on the Manila exchange since July), he remained confident that the country's fundamentals and its corporate base were sound. ''If you look at the property groups, they're slowing down a bit,'' he said. ''But they will survive. The banking sector is going to be O.K. They have been through so many troughs, they're overcautious, unlike Thai banks. Everybody is still upbeat.''\\nMost frustrating, said Mr. SyCip of SGV, is the tendency of bankers and investors outside Asia to lump the region into one pot. ''All countries in the region do have problems,'' he said, ''but not serious enough for 50 percent declines in stock markets -- except for Thailand. Here, building is still going on. Our banking system is much more transparent. Our export figures are comfortably up, and a lot of plants are coming on line. It's a failure to distinguish one country from another.''\\n\", 8]\n",
      "[1.8058905399930165e-05, 'MACASSAR TO THE ARU ISLANDS IN A NATIVE PRAU\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(DECEMBER, 1856)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0IT was the beginning of December, and the rainy season at Macassar had just set in. For nearly three months had beheld the sun rise daily above the palm-groves, mount to the zenith, and descend like a globe of fire into the ocean, unobscured for a single moment of his course. Now dark leaden clouds had gathered over the whole heavens, and seemed to have rendered him permanently invisible. The strong east winds, warm and dry and dust-laden, which had hitherto blown as certainly as the sun had risen, were now replaced by variable gusty breezes and heavy rains, often continuous for three days and nights together; and the parched and fissured rice stubbles which during the dry weather had extended in every direction for miles around the town, were already so flooded as to be only passable by boats, or by means of a labyrinth of paths on the top of the narrow banks which divided the separate properties.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Five months of this kind of weather might be expected in Southern Celebes, and I therefore determined to seek some more favourable climate for collecting in during that period, and to return in the next dry season to complete my exploration of the district. Fortunately for me I was in one of the treat emporiums of the native trade of the archipelago. Rattans from Borneo, sandal-wood and bees\\'-was from Flores and Timor, tripang from the Gulf of Carpentaria, cajputi-oil from Bouru, wild nutmegs and mussoi-bark from New Guinea, are all to be found in the stores of the Chinese and Bugis merchants of Macassar, along with the rice and coffee which are the chief products of the surrounding country. More important than all these however is the trade to Aru, a group of islands situated on the south-west coast of New Guinea, and of which almost the whole produce comes to Macassar in native vessels. These islands are quite out of the track of all European trade, and are inhabited only by black mop-headed savages, who yet contribute to the luxurious tastes of the most civilized races. Pearls, mother-of-pearl, and tortoiseshell find their way to Europe, while edible birds\\' nests and \"tripang\" or sea-slug are obtained by shiploads for the gastronomic enjoyment of the Chinese.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The trade to these islands has existed from very early times, and it is from them that Birds of Paradise, of the two kinds known to Linnaeus were first brought The native vessels can only make the voyage once a year, owing to the monsoons. They leave Macassar in December or January at the beginning of the west monsoon, and return in July or August with the full strength of the east monsoon. Even by the Macassar people themselves, the voyage to the Aru Islands is looked upon as a rather wild and romantic expedition, fall of novel sights and strange adventures. He who has made it is looked up to as an authority, and it remains with many the unachieved ambition of their lives. I myself had hoped rather than expected ever to reach this \"Ultima Thule\" of the East: and when I found that I really could do so now, had I but courage to trust myself for a thousand miles\\' voyage in a  Bugis prau, and for six or seven months among lawless traders and ferocious savages, I felt somewhat as I did when, a schoolboy, I was for the first time allowed to travel outside the stage-coach, to visit that scene of all that is strange and new and wonderful to young imaginations-London!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0By the help of some kind friends I was introduced to the owner of one of the large praus which was to sail in a few days. He was a Javanese half-caste, intelligent, mild, and gentlemanly in his manners, and had a young and pretty Dutch wife, whom he was going to leave behind during his absence. When we talked about passage money he would fix no sum, but insisted on leaving it entirely to me to pay on my return exactly what I liked. \"And then,\" said he, \"whether you give me one dollar or a hundred, I shall he satisfied, and shall ask no more.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The remainder of my stay was fully occupied in laying in stores, engaging servants, and making every other preparation for an absence of seven months from even the outskirts of civilization. On the morning of December 13th, when we went on board at daybreak, it was raining hard. We set sail and it came on to blow. Our boat was lost astern, our sails damaged, and the evening found us hack again in Macassar harbour. We remained there four days longer, owing to its raining all the time, thus rendering it impossible to dry and repair the huge mat sails. All these dreary days I remained on board, and during the rare intervals when it didn\\'t rain, made myself acquainted with our outlandish craft, some of the peculiarities of which I will now endeavour to describe.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It was a vessel of about seventy tons burthen, and shaped something like a Chinese junk. The deck sloped considerably downward to the bows, which are thus the lowest part of the ship. There were two large rudders, but instead of being planed astern they were hung on the quarters from strong cross beams, which projected out two or three feet on each side, and to which extent the deck overhung the sides of the vessel amidships. The rudders were not hinged but hung with slings of rattan, the friction of which keeps them in any position in which they are placed, and thus perhaps facilitates steering. The tillers were not on deck, but entered the vessel through two square openings into a lower or half deck about three feet high, in which sit the two steersmen. In the after part of the vessel was a low poop, about three and a half feet high, which forms the captain\\'s cabin, its furniture consisting of boxes, mats, and pillows. In front of the poop and mainmast was a little thatched house on deck, about four feet high to the ridge; and one compartment of this, forming a cabin six and a half feet long by five and a half wide, I had all to myself, and it was the snuggest and most comfortable little place I ever enjoyed at sea. It was entered by a low sliding door of thatch on one side, and had a very small window on the other. The floor was of split bamboo, pleasantly elastic, raised six inches above the deck, so as to be quite dry. It was covered with fine cane mats, for the manufacture of which Macassar is celebrated; against the further wall were arranged my guncase, insect-boxes, clothes, and books; my mattress occupied the middle, and next the door were my canteen, lamp, and little store of luxuries for the voyage; while guns, revolver, and hunting knife hung conveniently from the roof. During these four miserable days I was quite jolly in this little snuggery more so than I should have been if confined the same time to the gilded and uncomfortable saloon of a first-class steamer. Then, how comparatively sweet was everything on board--no paint, no tar, no new rope, (vilest of smells to the qualmish!) no grease, or oil, or varnish; but instead of these, bamboo and rattan, and coir rope and palm thatch; pure vegetable fibres, which smell pleasantly if they smell at all, and recall quiet scenes in the green and shady forest.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our ship had two masts, if masts they can be called c which were great moveable triangles. If in an ordinary ship you replace the shrouds and backstay by strong timbers, and take away the mast altogether, you have the arrangement adopted on board a prau. Above my cabin, and resting on cross-beams attached to the masts, was a wilderness of yards and spars, mostly formed of bamboo. The mainyard, an immense affair nearly a hundred feet long, was formed of many pieces of wood and bamboo bound together with rattans in an ingenious manner. The sail carried by this was of an oblong shape, and was hung out of the centre, so that when the short end was hauled down on deck the long end mounted high in the air, making up for the lowness of the mast itself. The foresail was of the same shape, but smaller. Both these were of matting, and, with two jibs and a fore and aft sail astern of cotton canvas, completed our rig.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The crew consisted of about thirty men, natives of Macassar and the adjacent coasts and islands. They were  mostly young, and were short, broad-faced, good-humoured looking fellows. Their dress consisted generally of a pair of trousers only, when at work, and a handkerchief twisted round the head, to which in the evening they would add a thin cotton jacket. Four of the elder men were \"jurumudis,\" or steersmen, who had to squat (two at a time) in the little steerage before described, changing every six hours. Then there was an old man, the \"juragan,\" or captain, but who was really what we should call the first mate; he occupied the other half of the little house on deck. There were about ten respectable men, Chinese or Bugis, whom our owner used to call \"his own people.\" He treated them very well, shared his meals with them, and spoke to them always with perfect politeness; yet they were most of them a kind of slave debtors, bound over by the police magistrate to work for him at mere nominal wages for a term of years till their debts were liquidated. This is a Dutch institution in this part of the world, and seems to work well. It is a great boon to traders, who can do nothing in these thinly- populated regions without trusting goods to agents and petty dealers, who frequently squander them away in gambling and debauchery. The lower classes are almost all in a chronic state of debt. The merchant trusts them again and again, till the amount is something serious, when he brings them to court and has their services allotted to him for its liquidation. The debtors seem to think this no disgrace, but rather enjoy their freedom from responsibility, and the dignity of their position under a wealthy and well-known merchant. They trade a little on their own account, and both parties seem to get on very well together. The plan seems a more sensible one than that which we adopt, of effectually preventing a man from earning anything towards paying his debts by shutting him up in a jail.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My own servants were three in number. Ali, the Malay boy whom I had picked up in Borneo, was my head man. He had already been with me a year, could turn his hand to anything, and was quite attentive and trustworthy. He was a good shot, and fond of shooting, and I had taught him to skin birds very well. The second, named Baderoon, was a Macassar lad; also a pretty good boy, but a desperate gambler. Under pretence of buying a house for his mother, and clothes, for himself, he had received four months\\' wages about a week before we sailed, and in a day or two gambled away every dollar of it. He had come on board with no clothes, no betel, or tobacco, or salt fish, all which necessary articles I was obliged to send Ali to buy for him. These two lads were about sixteen, I should suppose; the third was younger, a sharp little rascal named Baso, who had been with me a month or two, and had learnt to cook tolerably. He was to fulfil the important office of cook and housekeeper, for I could not get any regular servants to go to such a terribly remote country; one might as well ask a chef de cuisine to go to Patagonia.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the fifth day that I had spent on board (Dec. 15th) the rain ceased, and final preparations were made for starting. Sails were dried and furled, boats were constantly coming and going, and stores for the voyage, fruit, vegetables, fish, and palm sugar, were taken on board. In the afternoon two women arrived with a large party of friends and relations, and at parting there was a general noserubbing (the Malay kiss), and some tears shed. These were promising symptoms for our getting off the next day; and accordingly, at three in the morning, the owner came on board, the anchor was immediately weighed, and by four we set sail. Just as we were fairly off and clear of the other praus, the old juragan repeated some prayers, all around responding with \"Allah il Allah,\" and a few strokes on a gong as an accompaniment, concluding with all wishing each other \"Salaamat jalan,\" a safe and happy journey. We had a light breeze, a calm sea, and a fine morning, a prosperous commencement of our voyage of about a thousand miles to the far-famed Aru Islands.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The wind continued light and variable all day, with a calm in the evening before the land breeze sprang up, were then passing the island of \"Tanakaki \"(foot of the land), at the extreme south of this part of Celebes. There are some dangerous rocks here, and as I was standing by the bulwarks, I happened to spit over the side; one of the men begged I would not do so just now, but spit on deck, as they were much afraid of this place. Not quite comprehending, I made him repeat his request, when, seeing he was in earnest, I said, \"Very well, I suppose there are \\'hantus\\' (spirits) here.\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"and they don\\'t like anything to be thrown overboard; many a prau has been lost by doing it.\" Upon which I promised to be very careful. At sunset the good Mahometans on board all repeated a few words of prayer with a general chorus, reminding me of the pleasing and impressive \"Ave. Maria\" of Catholic countries.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 20th. - At sunrise we were opposite the Bontyne mountain, said to be one of the highest in Celebes. In the afternoon we passed the Salayer Straits and had a little squall, which obliged us to lower our huge mast, sails, and heavy yards. The rest of the evening we had a fine west wind, which carried us on at near five knots an hour, as much as our lumbering old tub can possibly go.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 21st. - A heavy swell from the south-west rolling us about most uncomfortably. A steady wind was blowing however, and we got on very well.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 22cd. - The swell had gone down. We passed Boutong, a large island, high, woody, and populous, the native place of some of our crew. A small prau returning from Bali to the, island of Goram overtook us. The nakoda (captain) was known to our owner. They had been two years away, but were full of people, with several black Papuans on board. At 6 P.M. we passed Wangiwangi, low but not flat, inhabited and subject to Boutong. We had now fairly entered the Molucca Sea. After dark it was a beautiful sight to look down on our rudders, from which rushed eddying streams of phosphoric light gemmed with whirling sparks of fire. It resembled (more nearly than anything else to which I can compare it) one of the large irregular nebulous star-clusters seen through a good telescope, with the additional attraction of ever-changing form and dancing motion.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 23rd. - Fine red sunrise; the island we left last evening barely visible behind us. The Goram prau about a mile south of us. They have no compass, yet they have kept a very true course during the night. Our owner tells me they do it by the swell of the sea, the direction of which they notice at sunset, and sail by it during the night. In these seas they are never (in fine weather) more than two days without seeing land. Of course adverse winds or currents sometimes carry them away, but they soon fall in with some island, and there are always some old sailors on board who know it, and thence take a new course. Last night a shark about five feet long was caught, and this morning it was cut up and cooked. In the afternoon they got another, and I had a little fried, and found it firm and dry, but very palatable. In the evening the sun set in a heavy bank of clouds, which, as darkness came on, assumed a fearfully black appearance. According to custom, when strong wind or rain is expected, our large sails -were furled, and with their yards let down on deck, and a small square foresail alone kept up. The great mat sails are most awkward things to manage in rough weather. The yards which support them are seventy feet long, and of course very heavy, and the only way to furl them being to roll up the sail on the boom, it is a very dangerous thing to have them standing when overtaken by a squall. Our crew; though numerous enough for a vessel of 700 instead of one of 70 tons, have it very much their own way, and there seems to be seldom more than a dozen at work at a time. When anything important is to be done, however, all start up willingly enough, but then all think themselves at liberty to give their opinion, and half a dozen voices are heard giving orders, and there is such a shrieking and confusion that it seems wonderful anything gets done at all.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Considering we have fifty men of several tribes and tongues onboard, wild, half-savage looking fellows, and few of them feeling any of the restraints of morality or education, we get on wonderfully well. There is no fighting or quarrelling, as there would certainly be among the same number of Europeans with as little restraint upon their actions, and there is scarcely any of that noise and excitement which might be expected. In fine weather the greater part of them are quietly enjoying themselves- -some are sleeping under the shadow of the sails; others, in little groups of three or four, are talking or chewing betel; one is making a new handle to his chopping-knife, another is stitching away at a new pair of trousers or a shirt, and all are as quiet and well-conducted as on board the best-ordered English merchantman. Two or three take it by turns to watch in the bows and see after the braces and halyards of the great sails; the two steersmen are below in the steerage; our captain, or the juragan, gives the course, guided partly by the compass and partly by the direction of the wind, and a watch of two or three on the poop look after the trimming of the sails and call out the hours by the water-clock. This is a very ingenious contrivance, which measures time well in both rough weather and fine. It is simply a bucket half filled with water, in which floats the half of a well-scraped cocoa-nut shell. In the bottom of this shell is a very small hole, so that when placed to float in the bucket a fine thread of water squirts up into it. This gradually fills the shell, and the size of the hole is so adjusted to the capacity of the vessel that, exactly at the end of an hour, plump it goes to the bottom. The watch then cries out the number of hours from sunrise and sets the shell afloat again empty. This is a very good measurer of time. I tested it with my watch and found that it hardly varied a minute from one hour to another, nor did the motion of the vessel have any effect upon it, as the water in the bucket of course kept level. It has a great advantage for a rude people in being easily understood, in being rather bulky and easy to see, and in the final submergence being accompanied with a little bubbling and commotion of the water, which calls the attention to it. It is also quickly replaced if lost while in harbour.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Our captain and owner I find to be a quiet, good-tempered man, who seems to get on very well with all about him. When at sea he drinks no wine or spirits, but indulges only in coffee and cakes, morning and afternoon, in company with his supercargo and assistants. He is a man of some little education, can read and write well both Dutch and Malay, uses a compass, and has a chart. He has been a trader to Aru for many years, and is well known to both Europeans and natives in this part of the world.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 24th. - Fine, and little wind. No land in sight for the first time since we left Macassar. At noon calm, with heavy showers, in which our crew wash their clothes, anti in the afternoon the prau is covered with shirts, trousers, and sarongs of various gay colours. I made a discovery to-day which at first rather alarmed me. The two ports, or openings, through which the tillers enter from the lateral rudders are not more than three or four feet above the surface of the water, which thus has a free entrance into the vessel. I of course had imagined that this open space from one side to the other was separated from the hold by a water-tight bulkhead, so that a sea entering might wash out at the further side, and do no more harm than give the steersmen a drenching. To my surprise end dismay, however, I find that it is completely open to the hold, so that half-a-dozen seas rolling in on a stormy night would nearly, or quite, swamp us. Think of a vessel going to sea for a month with two holes, each a yard square, into the hold, at three feet above the water-line,-holes, too, which cannot possibly be closed! But our captain says all praus are so; and though he acknowledges the danger, \"he does not know how to alter it--the people are used to it; he does not understand praus so well as they do, and if such a great alteration were made, he should be sure to have difficulty in getting a crew!\" This proves at all events that praus must be good sea-boats, for the captain has been continually making voyages in them for the last ten years, and says he has never known water enough enter to do any harm.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec.25th. - Christmas-day dawned upon us with gusts of wind, driving rain, thunder and lightning, added to which a short confused sea made our queer vessel pitch and roll very uncomfortably. About nine o\\'clock, however, it cleared up, and we then saw ahead of us the fine island of Bouru, perhaps forty or fifty miles distant, its mountains wreathed with clouds, while its lower lands were still invisible. The afternoon was fine, and the wind got round again to the west; but although this is really the west monsoon, there is no regularity or steadiness about it, calms and breezes from every point of the compass continually occurring. The captain, though nominally a Protestant, seemed to have no idea of Christmas-day as a festival. Our dinner was of rice and curry as usual, and an extra glass of wine was all I could do to celebrate it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 26th. - Fine view of the mountains of Bouru, which we have now approached considerably. Our crew seem rather a clumsy lot. They do not walk the deck with the easy swing of English sailors, but hesitate and stagger like landsmen. In the night the lower boom of our mainsail broke, and they were all the morning repairing it. It consisted of two bamboos lashed together, thick end to thin, and was about seventy feet long. The rigging and arrangement of these praus contrasts strangely with that of European vessels, in which the various ropes and spars, though much more numerous, are placed so as not to interfere with each other\\'s action. Here the case is quite different; for though there are no shrouds or stays to complicate the matter, yet scarcely anything can be done without first clearing something else out of the way. The large sails cannot be shifted round to go on the other tack without first hauling down the jibs, and the booms of the fore and aft sails have to be lowered and completely detached to perform the same operation. Then there are always a lot of ropes foul of each other, and all the sails can never be set (though they are so few) without a good part of their surface having the wind kept out of them by others. Yet praus are much liked even by those who have had European vessels, because of their cheapness both in first cost and in keeping up; almost all repairs can be done by the crew, and very few European stores are required.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 28th. - This day we saw the Banda group, the volcano first appearing,--a perfect cone, having very much the outline of the Egyptian pyramids, and looking almost as regular. In the evening the smoke rested over its summit like a small stationary cloud. This was my first view of an active volcano, but pictures and panoramas have so impressed such things on one\\'s mind, that when we at length behold them they seem nothing extraordinary.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 30th. - Passed the island of Teor, and a group near it, which are very incorrectly marked on the charts. Flying-fish were numerous to-day. It is a smaller species than that of the Atlantic, and more active and elegant in its motions. As they skim along the surface they turn on their sides, so as fully to display their beautiful fins, taking a flight of about a hundred yards, rising and falling in n most graceful manner. At a little distance they exactly resemble swallows, and no one who sees them can doubt that they really do fly, not merely descend in an oblique direction from the height they gain by their first spring. In the evening an aquatic bird, a species of booby (Sula fiber.) rested on our hen-coop, and was caught by the neck by one of my boys.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dec. 31st. - At daybreak the Ké Islands (pronounced Kay) were in sight, where we are to stay a few days. About noon we rounded the northern point, and endeavoured to coast along to the anchorage; but being now on the leeward side of the island, the wind came in violent irregular gusts, and then leaving us altogether, we were carried back by a strong current. Just then two boats-load of natives appeared, and our owner having agreed with them to tow us into harbour, they tried to do so, assisted by our own boat, but could make no way. We were therefore obliged to anchor in a very dangerous place on a rocky bottom, and we were engaged till nearly dark getting hawsers secured to some rocks under water. The coast of Ké along which we had passed was very picturesque. Light coloured limestone rocks rose abruptly from the water to the height of several hundred feet, everywhere broken into jutting peaks and pinnacles, weather-worn into sharp points and honeycombed surfaces, and clothed throughout with a most varied and luxuriant vegetation. The cliffs above the sea offered to our view screw-pines and arborescent Liliaceae of strange forms, mingled with shrubs and creepers; while the higher slopes supported a dense growth of forest trees. Here and there little bays and inlets presented beaches of dazzling whiteness. The water was transparent as crystal, and tinged the rock-strewn slope which plunged steeply into its unfathomable depths with colours varying from emerald to lapis-lazuli. The sea was calm as a lake, and the glorious sun of the tropics threw a flood of golden light over all. The scene was to me inexpressibly delightful. I was in a new world, and could dream of the wonderful productions hid in those rocky forests, and in those azure abysses. But few European feet had ever trodden the shores I gazed upon its plants, and animals, and men were alike almost unknown, and I could not help speculating on what my wanderings there for a few days might bring to light.\\nTHE KÉ ISLANDS\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(JANUARY 1857)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0THE native boats that had come to meet us were three or four in number, containing in all about fifty men.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0They were long canoes, with the bow and stern rising up into a beak six or night feet high, decorated with shells and waving plumes of cassowaries hair. I now had my first view of Papuans in their own country, and in less than five minutes was convinced that the opinion already arrived at by the examination of a few Timor and New Guinea slaves was substantially correct, and that the people I now had an opportunity of comparing side by side belonged to two of the most  distinct and strongly marked races that the earth contains. Had I been blind, I could have been certain that these islanders were not Malays. The loud, rapid, eager tones, the incessant motion, the intense vital activity manifested in speech and action, are the very antipodes of the quiet, unimpulsive, unanimated Malay These Ké men came up singing and shouting, dipping their paddles deep in the water and throwing up clouds of spray; as they approached nearer they stood up in their canoes and increased their noise and gesticulations; and on coming alongside, without asking leave, and without a moment\\'s hesitation, the greater part of them scrambled up on our deck just as if they were come to take possession of a captured vessel. Then commenced a scene of indescribable confusion. These forty black, naked, mop-headed savages seemed intoxicated with joy and excitement. Not one of them could remain still for a moment. Every individual of our crew was in turn surrounded and examined, asked for tobacco or arrack, grinned at and deserted for another. All talked at once, and our captain was regularly mobbed by the chief men, who wanted to be employed to tow us in, and who begged vociferously to be paid in advance. A few presents of tobacco made their eyes glisten; they would express their satisfaction by grins and shouts, by rolling on deck, or by a headlong leap overboard. Schoolboys on an unexpected holiday, Irishmen at a fair, or mid-shipmen on shore, would give but a faint idea of the exuberant animal enjoyment of these people.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Under similar circumstances Malays could not behave as these Papuans did. If they came on board a vessel (after asking permission), not a word would be at first spoken, except a few compliments, and only after some time, and very cautiously, world any approach be made to business. One would speak at a time, with a low voice and great deliberation, and the mode of making a bargain would be by quietly refusing all your offers, or even going away without saying another word about the matter, unless advanced your price to what they were willing to accept. Our crew, many of whom had not made the voyage before, seemed quite scandalized at such unprecedented bad manners, and only very gradually made any approach to fraternization with the black fellows. They reminded me of a party of demure and well-behaved children suddenly broken in upon by a lot of wild romping, riotous boys, whose conduct seems most extraordinary and very naughty. These moral features are more striking and more conclusive of absolute diversity than oven the physical contrast presented by the two races, though that is sufficiently remarkable. The sooty blackness of the skin, the mop-like head of frizzly hair, and, most important of all, the marked form of countenance of quite a different type from that of the Malay, are what we cannot believe to result from mere climatal or other modifying influences on one and the same race. The Malay face is of the Mongolian type, broad and somewhat flat. The brows are depressed, the mouth wide, but not projecting, and the nose small and well formed but for the great dilatation of the nostrils. The face is smooth, and rarely develops the trace of a beard; the hair black, coarse, and perfectly straight. The Papuan, on the other hand, has a face which we may say is compressed and projecting. The brows are protuberant and overhanging, the mouth large and prominent, while the nose is very large, the apex elongated downwards, the ridge thick, and the nostrils large. It is an obtrusive and remarkable feature in the countenance, the very reverse of what obtains in the Malay face. The twisted beard and frizzly hair complete this remarkable contrast. Hero then I had reached a new world, inhabited by a strange people. Between the Malayan tribes, among whom I had for some years been living, and the Papuan races, whose country I had now entered, we may fairly say that there is as much difference, both moral and physical, as between the red Indians of South America and the negroes of Guinea on the opposite side of the Atlantic.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Jan. 1st, 1857. - This has been a day of thorough enjoyment. I have wandered in the forests of an island rarely seen by Europeans. Before daybreak we left our anchorage, and in an hour reached the village of Har, where we were to stay three or four days. The range of hills here receded so as to form a small bay, and they were broken up into peaks and hummocks with intervening flats and hollows. A broad beach of the whitest sand lined the inner part of the bay, backed by a mass of cocoa-nut palms, among which the huts were concealed, and surmounted by a dense and varied growth of timber. Canoes and boats of various sizes were drawn up on the beach and one or two idlers, with a few children and a dog, gazed at our prau as we came to an anchor.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When we went on shore the first thing that attracted us was a large and well-constructed shed, under which a long boat was being built, while others in various stages of completion were placed at intervals along the beach.  Our captain, who wanted two of moderate size for the trade among the islands at Aru, immediately began bargaining for them, and in a short tine had arranged the nuns number of brass guns, gongs, sarongs, handkerchiefs, axes, white plates, tobacco, and arrack, which he was to give for a hair which could be got ready in four days. We then went to the village, which consisted only of three or four huts, situated immediately above the beach on an irregular rocky piece of ground overshadowed with cocoa-nuts, palms, bananas, and other fruit trees. The houses were very rude, black, and half rotten, raised a few feet on posts with low sides of bamboo or planks, and high thatched roofs. They had small doors and no windows, an opening under the projecting gables letting the smoke out and a little light in. The floors were of strips of bamboo, thin, slippery, and elastic, and so weak that my feet were in danger of plunging through at every step. Native boxes of pandanus-leaves and slabs of palm pith, very neatly constructed, mats of the same, jars and cooking pots of native pottery, and a few European plates and basins, were the whole furniture, and the interior was throughout dark and smoke-blackened, and dismal in the extreme.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Accompanied by Ali and Baderoon, I now attempted to make some explorations, and we were followed by a train of boys eager to see what we were going to do. The most trodden path from the beach led us into a shady hollow, where the trees were of immense height and the undergrowth scanty. From the summits of these trees came at intervals a deep booming sound, which at first puzzled us, but which we soon found to proceed from some large pigeons. My boys shot at them, and after one or two misses, brought one down. It was a magnificent bird twenty inches long, of a bluish white colour, with the back wings and tail intense metallic green, with golden, blue, and violet reflexions, the feet coral red, and the eyes golden yellow. It is a rare species, which I have named Carpophaga concinna, and is found only in a few small islands, where, however, it abounds. It is the same species which in the island of Banda is called the nutmeg-pigeon, from its habit of devouring the fruits, the seed or nutmeg being thrown up entire and uninjured. Though these pigeons have a narrow beak, yet their jaws and throat are so extensible that they can swallow fruits of very large size. I had before shot a species much smaller than this one, which had a number of hard globular palm-fruits in its crop, each more than an inch in diameter.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A little further the path divided into two, one leading along the beach, and across mangrove and sago swamps the other rising to cultivated grounds. We therefore returned, and taking a fresh departure from the village, endeavoured to ascend the hills and penetrate into the interior. The path, however, was a most trying one. Where there was earth, it was a deposit of reddish clay overlying the rock, and was worn so smooth by the attrition of naked feet that my shoes could obtain no hold on the sloping surface. A little farther we came to the bare rock, and this was worse, for it was so rugged and broken, and so honeycombed and weatherworn into sharp points and angles, that my boys, who had gone barefooted all their lives, could not stand it. Their feet began to bleed, and I saw that if I did not want them completely lamed it would be wise to turn lack. My own shoes, which were rather thin, were but a poor protection, and would soon have been cut to pieces; yet our little naked guides tripped along with the greatest ease and unconcern, and seemed much astonished at our effeminacy in not being able to take a walk which to them was a perfectly agreeable one. During the rest of our stay in the island we were obliged to confine ourselves to the vicinity of the shore and the cultivated grounds, and those more level portions of the forest where a little soil had accumulated and the rock had been less exposed to atmospheric action.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The island of Ké (pronounced exactly as the letter K, but erroneously spelt in our maps Key or Ki) is long and narrow, running in a north and south direction, and consists almost entirely of rock and mountain. It is everywhere covered with luxuriant forests, and in its bays and inlets the sand is of dazzling whiteness, resulting from the decomposition of the coralline limestone of which it is entirely composed. In all the little swampy inlets and valleys sago trees abound, and these supply the main subsistence of the natives, who grow no rice, and have scarcely any other cultivated products but cocoa-nuts, plantains, and yams. From the cocoa-nuts, which surround every hut, and which thrive exceedingly on the porous limestone soil and under the influence of salt breezes, oil is made which is sold at a good price to the Aru traders, who all touch here to lay in their stuck of this article, as well as to purchase boats and native crockery. Wooden bowls, pans, and trays are also largely made here, hewn out of solid blocks of wood with knife and adze; and these are carried to all parts of the Moluccas. But the art in which the natives of Ké pre-eminently excel is that of boat building. Their forests supply abundance of fine timber, though, probably not more so than many other islands, and from some unknown causes these remote savages have come to excel in what seems a very difficult art. Their small canoes are beautifully formed, broad and low in the centre, but rising at each end, where they terminate in high-pointed beaks more or less carved, and ornamented with a plume of feathers. They are not hollowed out of a tree, but are regularly built of planks running from ego to end, and so accurately fitted that it is often difficult to find a place where a knife-blade can be inserted between the joints. The larger ones are from 20 to 30 tons burthen, and are finished ready for sea without a nail or particle of iron being used, and with no other tools than axe, adze, and auger. These vessels are handsome to look at, good sailers, and admirable sea-boats, and will make long voyages with perfect safety, traversing the whole Archipelago from New Guinea to Singapore in seas which, as every one who has sailed much in them can testify, are not so smooth and tempest-free as word- painting travellers love to represent them.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The forests of Ké produce magnificent timber, tall, straight, and durable, of various qualities, some of which are said to be superior to the best Indian teak. To make each pair of planks used in the construction of the larger boats an entire tree is consumed. It is felled, often miles away from the shore, cut across to the proper length, and then hewn longitudinally into two equal portions. Each of these forms a plank by cutting down with the axe to a uniform thickness of three or four inches, leaving at first a solid block at each end to prevent splitting. Along the centre of each plank a series of projecting pieces are left, standing up three or four inches, about the same width, and a foot long; these are of great importance in the construction of the vessel. When a sufficient number of planks have been made, they are laboriously dragged through the forest by three or four men each to the beach, where the boat is to be built. A foundation piece, broad in the middle and rising considerably at each end, is first laid on blocks and properly shored up. The edges of this are worked true and smooth with the adze, and a plank, properly curved and tapering at each end, is held firmly up against it, while a line is struck along it which allows it to be cut so as to fit exactly. A series of auger holes, about as large as one\\'s finger, are then bored along the opposite edges, and pins of very hard wood are fitted to these, so that the two planks are held firmly, and can be driven into the closest contact; and difficult as this seems to do without any other aid than rude practical skill in forming each edge to the true corresponding curves, and in poring the holes so as exactly to match both in position and direction, yet so well is it done that the best European shipwright cannot produce sounder or closer- fitting joints. The boat is built up in this way by fitting plank to plank till the proper height and width are obtained. We have now a skin held together entirely by the hardwood pins connecting the edges of the planks, very strong and elastic, but having nothing but the adhesion of these pins to prevent the planks gaping. In the smaller boats seats, in the larger ones cross- beams, are now fixed. They are sprung into slight notches cut to receive them, and are further secured to the projecting pieces of the plank below by a strong lashing of rattan. Ribs are now formed of single pieces of tough wood chosen and trimmed so as exactly to fit on to the projections from each plank, being slightly notched to receive them, and securely bound to them by rattans passed through a hole in each projecting piece close to the surface of the plank. The ends are closed against the vertical prow and stern posts, and further secured with pegs and rattans, and then the boat is complete; and when fitted with rudders, masts, and thatched covering, is ready to do battle with, the waves. A careful consideration of the principle of this mode of construction, and allowing for the strength and binding qualities of rattan (which resembles in these respects wire rather than cordage), makes me believe that a vessel carefully built in this manner is actually stronger and safer than one fastened in the ordinary way with nails.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0During our stay here we were all very busy. Our captain was daily superintending the completion of his two small praus. All day long native boats were coming with fish, cocoa-nuts, parrots and lories, earthen pans, sirip leaf, wooden bowls, and trays, &c. &e., which every one of the fifty inhabitants of our prau seemed to be buying on his own account, till all available and most unavailable space of our vessel was occupied with these miscellaneous articles: for every man on board a prau considers himself at liberty to trade, and to carry with him whatever he can afford to buy.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Money is unknown and valueless here--knives, cloth, and arrack forming the only medium of exchange, with tobacco for small coin. Every transaction is the subject of a special bargain, and the cause of much talking. It is absolutely necessary to offer very little, as the natives are never satisfied till you add a little more. They are then far better pleased than if you had given them twice the amount at first and refused to increase it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I, too, was doing a little business, having persuaded some of the natives to collect insects for me; and when they really found that I gave them most fragrant tobacco for worthless black and green beetles, I soon had scores of visitors, men, women, and children, bringing bamboos full of creeping things, which, alas! too frequently had eaten each other into fragments during the tedium of a day\\'s confinement. Of one grand new beetle, glittering with ruby and emerald tints, I got a large quantity, having first detected one of its wing-cases ornamenting the outside of a native\\'s tobacco pouch. It was quite a new species, and had not been found elsewhere than on this little island. It is one of the Buprestidae, and has been named Cyphogastra calepyga.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Each morning after an early breakfast I wandered by myself into the forest, where I found delightful occupation in capturing the large and handsome butterflies, which were tolerably abundant, and most of them new to me; for I was now upon the confines of the Moluccas and New Guinea,--a region the productions of which were then among the most precious and rare in the cabinets of Europe. Here my eyes were feasted for the first time with splendid scarlet lories on the wing, as well as by the sight of that most imperial butterfly, the \"Priamus \"of collectors, or a closely allied species, but flying so high that I did not succeed in capturing a specimen. One of them was brought me in a bamboo, bored up with a lot of beetles, and of course torn to pieces. The principal drawback of the place for a collector is the want of good paths, and the dreadfully rugged character of the surface, requiring the attention to be so continually directed to securing a footing, as to make it very difficult to capture active winged things, who pass out of reach while one is glancing to see that the next step may not plunge one into a chasm or over a precipice. Another inconvenience is that there are no running streams, the rock being of so porous a nature that the surface- water everywhere penetrates its fissures; at least such is the character of the neighbourhood we visited, the only water being small springs trickling out close to the sea-beach.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the forests of Ke, arboreal Liliaceae and Pandanaceae abound, and give a character to the vegetation in the more exposed rocky places. Flowers were scarce, and there were not many orchids, but I noticed the fine white butterfly-orchis, Phalaenopsis grandiflora, or a species closely allied to it. The freshness and vigour of the vegetation was very pleasing, and on such an arid rocky surface was a sure indication of a perpetually humid climate. Tall clean trunks, many of them buttressed, and immense trees of the fig family, with aerial roots stretching out and interlacing and matted together for fifty or a hundred feet above the ground, were the characteristic features; and there was an absence of thorny shrubs and prickly rattans, which would have made these wilds very pleasant to roam in, had it not been for the sharp honeycombed rocks already alluded to. In damp places a fine undergrowth of broadleaved herbaceous plants was found, about which swarmed little green lizards, with tails of the most \"heavenly blue,\" twisting in and out among the stalks and foliage so actively that I often caught glimpses of their tails only, when they startled me by their resemblance to small snakes. Almost the only sounds in these primeval woods proceeded from two birds, the red lories, who utter shrill screams like most of the parrot tribe, and the large green nutmeg-pigeon, whose voice is either a loud and deep boom, like two notes struck upon a very large gong, or sometimes a harsh toad-like croak, altogether peculiar and remarkable. Only two quadrupeds are said by the natives to inhabit the island--a wild pig and a Cuscus, or Eastern opossum, of neither of which could I obtain specimens.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The insects were more abundant, and very interesting. Of butterflies I caught thirty-five species, most of them new to me, and many quite unknown in European collections. Among them was the fine yellow and black Papilio euchenor, of which but few specimens had been previously captured, and several other handsome butterflies of large size, as well as some beautiful little \"blues,\" and some brilliant dayflying moths. The beetle tribe were less abundant, yet I obtained some very fine and rare species. On the leaves of a slender shrub in an old clearing I found several fine blue and black beetles of the genus Eupholus, which almost rival in beauty- the diamond beetles of South America. Some cocoa-nut palms in blossom on the beach were frequented by a fine green floral beetle (Lomaptera which, when the flowers were shaken, flew off like a small swarm of bees. I got one of our crew to climb up the tree, and he brought me a good number in his hand; and seeing they were valuable, I sent him up again with my net to shake the flowers into, and thus secured a large quantity. My best capture, however, was the superb insect of the Buprestis family, already mentioned as having been obtained from the natives, who told me they found it in rotten trees in the mountains.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the forest itself the only common and conspicuous coleoptera were two tiger beetles. One, Therates labiata, was much larger than our green tiger beetle, of a purple black colour, with green metallic glosses, and the broad upper lip of a bright yellow. It was always found upon foliage, generally of broad-leaned herbaceous plants, and in damp and gloomy situations, taking frequent short flights from leaf to leaf, and preserving an alert attitude, as if always looking out for its prey. Its vicinity could be immediately ascertained, often before it was seen, by a very pleasant odour, like otto of roses, which it seems to emit continually, and which may probably be attractive to the small insects on which it feeds. The other, Tricondyla aptera, is one of the most curious forms in the family of the Cicindelidae, and is almost exclusively confined to the Malay islands. In shape it resembles a very large ant, more than an inch long, and of a purple black colour. Like an ant also it is wingless, and is generally found ascending trees, passing around the trunks in a spiral direction when approached, to avoid capture, so that it requires a sudden run and active fingers to secure a specimen. This species emits the usual fetid odour of the ground beetles. My collections during our four days\\' stay at Ké were as follow:-- Birds, 13 species; insects, 194 species; and 3 kinds of land- shells.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There are two kinds of people inhabiting these islands--the indigenes, who have the Papuan characters strongly marked, and who are pagans; and a mixed race, who are nominally Mahometans, and wear cotton clothing, while the former use only a waist cloth of cotton or bark. These Mahometans are said to have been driven out of Banda by the early European settlers. They were probably a brown race, more allied to the Malays, and their mixed descendants here exhibit great variations of colour, hair, and features, graduating between the Malay and Papuan types. It is interesting to observe the influence of the early Portuguese trade with these countries in the words of their language, which still remain in use even among these remote and savage islanders. \"Lenco\" for handkerchief, and \"faca\" for knife, are here used to the exclusion of the proper Malay terms. The Portuguese and Spaniards were truly wonderful conquerors and colonizers. They effected more rapid changes in the countries they conquered than any other nations of modern times, resembling the Romans in their power of impressing their own language, religion, and manners on rode and barbarous tribes.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The striking contrast of character between these people and the Malays is exemplified in many little traits. One day when I was rambling in the forest, an old man stopped to look at me catching an insect. He stood very quiet till I had pinned and put it away in my collecting box, when he could contain himself no longer, but bent almost double, and enjoyed a hearty roar of laughter. Every one will recognise this as a true negro trait. A Malay would have stared, and asked with a tone of bewilderment what I was doing, for it is but little in his nature to laugh, never heartily, and still less at or in the presence of a stranger, to whom, however, his disdainful glances or whispered remarks are less agreeable than the most boisterous open expression of merriment. The women here were not so much frightened at strangers, or made to keep themselves so much secluded as among the Malay races; the children were more merry and had the \"nigger grin,\" while the noisy confusion of tongues among the men, and their excitement on very ordinary occasions, are altogether removed from the general taciturnity and reserve of the Malay.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The language of the Ké people consists of words of one, two, or three syllables in about equal proportions, and has many aspirated and a few guttural sounds. The different villages have slight differences of dialect, but they are mutually intelligible, and, except in words that have evidently been introduced during a long-continued commercial intercourse, seem to have no affinity whatever with the Malay languages.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Jan. 6th. - The small boats being finished, we sailed for Aru at 4 P.M., and as we left the shores of Ké had a line view of its rugged and mountainous character; ranges of hills, three or four thousand feet high, stretching southwards as far as the eye could reach, everywhere covered with a lofty, dense, and unbroken forest. We had very light winds, and it therefore took us thirty hours to make the passage of sixty miles to the low, or flat, but equally forest-covered Aru Islands, where we anchored in the harbour of Dobbo at nine in the evening of the next day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My first voyage in a prau being thus satisfactorily terminated, I must, before taking leave of it for some months, bear testimony to the merits of the queer old-world vessel. Setting aside all ideas of danger, which is probably, after all, not more than in any other craft, I must declare that I have never, either before or since, made a twenty days\\' voyage so pleasantly, or perhaps, more correctly speaking, with so little discomfort. This I attribute chiefly to having my small cabin on deck, and entirely to myself, to having my own servants to wait upon me, and to the absence of all those marine-store smells of paint, pitch, tallow, and new cordage, which are to me insupportable. Something is also to be put down to freedom from all restraint of dress, hours of meals, &c., and to the civility and obliging disposition of the captain. I had agreed to have my meals with him, but whenever I wished it I had them in my own berth, and at what hours I felt inclined. The crew were all civil and good-tempered, and with very little discipline everything went on smoothly, and the vessel was kept very clean and in pretty good order, so that on the whole I was much delighted with the trip, and was inclined to rate the luxuries of the semi-barbarous prau as surpassing those of the most magnificent screw-steamer, that highest result of our civilisation.\\nNATIVES OF ARU SHOOTING THE GREAT BIRD OF PARADISE\\nTHE ARU ISLANDS - RESIDENCE IN DOBBO\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(JANUARY TO MARCH  1857)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 8th of January, 1857, I landed at Dobbo, the trading settlement of the Bugis and Chinese, who annually visit the Aru Islands. It is situated on the small island of Wamma, upon a spit of sand which projects out to the north, and is just wide enough to contain three rows of houses. Though at first sight a most strange and desolate-looking place to build a village on, it has many advantages. There is a clear entrance from the west among the coral reefs that border the land, and there is good anchorage for vessels, on one side of the village or the other, in both the east and west monsoons. Being fully exposed to the sea-breezes in three directions it is healthy, and the soft sandy heath offers great facilities for hauling up the praus, in order to secure them from sea-worms and prepare them for the homeward voyage. At its southern extremity the sand-bank merges in the beach of the island, and is backed by a luxuriant growth of lofty forest. The houses are of various sizes, but are all built after one pattern, being merely large thatched sheds, a small portion of which, next the entrance, is used as a dwelling, while the rest is parted oft; and often divided by one or two floors, in order better to stow away merchandise and native produce.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As we had arrived early in the season, most of the houses were empty, and the place looked desolate in the extreme--the whole of the inhabitants who received us on our landing amounting to about half-a-dozen Bugis and Chinese. Our captain, Herr Warzbergen, had promised to obtain a house for me, but unforeseen difficulties presented themselves. One which was to let had no roof; and the owner, who was building it on speculation, could not promise to finish it in less than a month. Another, of which the owner was dead, and which I might therefore take undisputed possession of as the first comer, wanted considerable repairs, and no one could be found to do the work, although about four times its value was offered. The captain, therefore, recommended me to take possession of a pretty good house near his own, whose owner was not expected for some weeks; and as I was anxious to be on shore, I immediately had it cleared out, and by evening had all my things housed, and was regularly installed as an inhabitant of Dobbo. I had brought with me a cane chair, and a few light boards, which were soon rigged up into a table and shelves. A broad bamboo bench served as sofa and bedstead, my boxes were conveniently arranged, my mats spread on the floor, a window cut in the palm-leaf wall to light my table, and though the place was as miserable and gloomy a shed as could be imagined, I felt as contented as if I had obtained a well-furnished mansion, and looked forward to a month\\'s residence in it with unmixed satisfaction.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next morning, after an early breakfast, I set off to explore the virgin forests of Aru, anxious to set my mind at rest as to the treasures they were likely to yield, and the probable success of my long-meditated expedition. A little native imp was our guide, seduced by the gift of a German knife, value three- halfpence, and my Macassar boy Baderoon brought his chopper to clear the path if necessary.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We had to walk about half a mile along the beach, the ground behind the village being mostly swampy, and then turned into the forest along a path which leads to the native village of Wamma, about three miles off on the other side of the island. The path was a narrow one, and very little used, often swampy and obstructed by fallen trees, so that after about a mile we lost it altogether, our guide having turned back, and we were obliged to follow his example. In the meantime, however, I had not been idle, and my day\\'s captures determined the success of my journey in an entomological point of view. I had taken about thirty species of butterflies, more than I had ever captured in a day since leaving the prolific banks of the Amazon, and among them were many most rare and beautiful insects, hitherto only known by a few specimens from New Guinea. The large and handsome spectre butterfly, Hestia durvillei; the pale-winged peacock butterfly, Drusilla catops; and the most brilliant and wonderful of the clear-winged moths, Cocytia durvillei, were especially interesting, as well, as several little \"blues,\" equalling in brilliancy and beauty anything the butterfly world can produce. In the other groups of insects I was not so successful, but this was not to be wondered at in a mere exploring ramble, when only what is most conspicuous and novel attracts the attention. Several pretty beetles, a superb \"bug,\" and a few nice land- shells were obtained, and I returned in the afternoon well satisfied with my first trial of the promised land.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next two days were so wet and windy that there was no going out; but on the succeeding one the sun shone brightly, and I had the good fortune to capture one of the most magnificent insects the world contains, the great bird-winged butterfly, Ornithoptera Poseidon. I trembled with excitement as I saw it coming majestically towards me, and could hardly believe I had really succeeded in my stroke till I had taken it out of the net and was gazing, lost in admiration, at the velvet black and brilliant green of its wings, seven inches across, its bolder body, and crimson breast. It is true I had seen similar insects in cabinets at home, but it is quite another thing to capture such oneself-to feel it struggling between one\\'s fingers, and to gaze upon its fresh and living beauty, a bright gem shirring out amid the silent gloom of a dark and tangled forest. The village of Dobbo held that evening at least one contented man.\\nDOBBO, IN THE TRADING SEASON\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Jan. 26th. -- Having now been here a fortnight, I began to understand a little of the place and its peculiarities. Praus continually arrived, and the merchant population increased almost daily. Every two or three days a fresh house was opened, and the necessary repairs made. In every direction men were bringing in poles, bamboos, rattans, and the leaves of the nipa palm to construct or repair the walls, thatch, doors, and shutters of their houses, which they do with great celerity. Some of the arrivals were Macassar men or Bugis, but more from the small island of Goram, at the east end of Ceram, whose inhabitants are the petty traders of the far East. Then the natives of Aru come in from the other side of the islands (called here \"blakang tana,\" or \"back of the country\") with the produce they have collected during the preceding six months, and which they now sell to the traders, to some of whom they are most likely in debt.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Almost all, or I may safely say all, the new arrivals pay me a visit, to see with their own eyes the unheard-of phenomenon of a person come to stay at Dobbo who does not trade! They have their own ideas of the uses that may possibly be made of stuffed birds, beetles, and shells which are not the right shells--that is, \"mother-of-pearl.\" They every day bring me dead and broken shells, such as l can pick up by hundreds on the beach, and seem quite puzzled and distressed when I decline them. If, however, there are any snail shells among a lot, I take them, and ask for more--a principle of selection so utterly unintelligible to them, that they give it up in despair, or solve the problem by imputing hidden medical virtue to those which they see me preserve so carefully.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0These traders are all of the Malay race, or a mixture of which Malay is the chef ingredient, with the exception of a few Chinese. The natives of Aru, on the other hand, are, Papuans, with black or sooty brown skims, woolly or frizzly hair, thick- ridged prominent noses, and rather slender limbs. Most of them wear nothing but a waist-cloth, and a few of them may be seen all day long wandering about the half-deserted streets of Dobbo offering their little bit of merchandise for sale.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Living in a trader\\'s house everything is brought to me as well as to the rest,--bundles of smoked tripang, or \"beche de mer,\" looking like sausages which have been rolled in mud and then thrown up the chimney; dried sharks\\' fins, mother-of-pearl shells, as well as birds of Paradise, which, however, are so dirty and so badly preserved that I have as yet found no specimens worth purchasing. When I hardly look at the articles, and make no offer for them, they seem incredulous, and, as if fearing they have misunderstood me, again offer them, and declare what they want in return--knives, or tobacco, or sago, or handkerchiefs. I then have to endeavour to explain, through any interpreter who may be at hand, that neither tripang nor pearl oyster shells have any charms for me, and that I even decline to speculate in tortoiseshell, but that anything eatable I will buy- -fish, or turtle, or vegetables of any sort. Almost the only food, however, that we can obtain with any regularity, are fish and cockles of very good quality, and to supply our daily wants it is absolutely necessary to be always provided with four articles--tobacco, knives, sago-cakes, and Dutch copper doits-- because when the particular thing asked for is not forthcoming, the fish pass on to the next house, and we may go that day without a dinner. It is curious to see the baskets and buckets used here. The cockles are brought in large volute shells, probably the Cymbium ducale, while gigantic helmet-shells, a species of Cassis, suspended by a rattan handle, form the vessels in which fresh water is daily carried past my door. It is painful to a naturalist to see these splendid shells with their inner whorls ruthlessly broken away to fit them for their ignoble use.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My collections, however, got on but slowly, owing to the unexpectedly bad weather, violent winds with heavy showers having been so continuous as only to give me four good collecting days out of the first sixteen I spent here. Yet enough had been collected to show me that with time and fine weather I might expect to do something good. From the natives I obtained some very fine insects and a few pretty land-shells; and of the small number of birds yet shot more than half were known New Guinea species, and therefore certainly rare in European collections, while the remainder were probably new. In one respect my hopes seemed doomed to be disappointed. I had anticipated the pleasure of myself preparing fine specimens of the Birds of Paradise, but I now learnt that they are all at this season out of plumage, and that it is in September and October that they have the long plumes of yellow silky feathers in full perfection. As all the praus return in July, I should not be able to spend that season in Aru without remaining another whole year, which was out of the question. I was informed, however, that the small red species, the \"King Bird of Paradise,\" retains its plumage at all seasons, and this I might therefore hope to get.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As I became familiar with the forest scenery of the island, (perceived it to possess some characteristic features that distinguished it from that of Borneo and Malacca, while, what is very singular and interesting, it recalled to my mind the half- forgotten impressions of the forests of Equatorial America. For example, the palms were much more abundant than I had generally found them in the East, more generally mingled with the other vegetation, more varied in form and aspect, and presenting some of those lofty and majestic smooth-stemmed, pinnate-leaved species which recall the Uauassu (Attalea speciosa) of the Amazon, but which I had hitherto rarely met with in the Malayan islands.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In animal life the immense number and variety of spiders and of lizards were circumstances that recalled the prolific regions of south America, more especially the abundance and varied colours of the little jumping spiders which abound on flowers and foliage, and are often perfect gems of beauty. The web-spinning species were also more numerous than I had ever seen them, and were a great annoyance, stretching their nets across the footpaths just about the height of my face; and the threads composing these are so strong and glutinous as to require much trouble to free oneself from them. Then their inhabitants, great yellow-spotted monsters with bodies two inches long, and legs in proportion, are not pleasant to o run one\\'s nose against while pursuing some gorgeous butterfly, or gazing aloft in search of some strange-voiced bird. I soon found it necessary not only to brush away the web, but also to destroy the spinner; for at first, having cleared the path one day, I found the next morning that the industrious insects had spread their nets again in the very same places.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The lizards were equally striking by their numbers, variety, and the situations in which they were found. The beautiful blue- tailed species so abundant in Ké was not seen here. The Aru lizards are more varied but more sombre in their colours--shades of green, grey, brown, and even black, being very frequently seen. Every shrub and herbaceous plant was alive with them, every rotten trunk or dead branch served as a station for some of these active little insect-hunters, who, I fear, to satisfy their gross appetites, destroy many gems of the insect world, which would feast the eyes and delight the heart of our more discriminating entomologists. Another curious feature of the jungle here was the multitude of sea-shells everywhere met with on the ground and high up on the branches and foliage, all inhabited by hermit- crabs, who forsake the beach to wander in the forest. I lave actually seen a spider carrying away a good-sized shell and devouring its (probably juvenile) tenant. On the beach, which I had to walls along every morning to reach the forest, these creatures swarmed by thousands. Every dead shell, from the largest to the most minute, was appropriated by them. They formed small social parties of ten or twenty around bits of stick or seaweed, but dispersed hurriedly at the sound of approaching footsteps. After a windy night, that nasty-looking Chinese delicacy the sea-slug was sometimes thrown up on the beach, which was at such times thickly strewn with some of the most beautiful shells that adorn our cabinets, along with fragments and masses of coral and strange sponges, of which I picked up more than twenty different sorts. In many cases sponge and coral are so much alike that it is only on touching them that they can be distinguished. Quantities of seaweed, too, are thrown up; but strange as it may seem, these are far less beautiful and less varied than may be found on any favourable part of our own coasts.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The natives here, even those who seem to be of pare Papuan race, were much more reserved and taciturn than those of Ke. This is probably because I only saw them as yet among strangers and in small parties, One must see the savage at home to know what he really is. Even here, however, the Papuan character sometimes breaks out. Little boys sing cheerfully as they walk along, or talk aloud to themselves (quite a negro characteristic); and try all they can, the men cannot conceal their emotions in the true Malay fashion. A number of them were one day in my house, and having a fancy to try what sort of eating tripang would be, I bought a couple, paying for them with such an extravagant quantity of tobacco that the seller saw I was a green customer. He could not, however, conceal his delight, but as he smelt the fragrant weed, and exhibited the large handful to his companions, he grinned and twisted and gave silent chuckles in a most expressive pantomime. I had often before made the same mistake in paying a Malay for some trifle. In no case, however, was his pleasure visible on his countenance--a dull and stupid hesitation only showing his surprise, which would be exhibited exactly in the same way whether he was over or under paid. These little moral traits are of the greatest interest when taken in connexion with physical features. They do not admit of the same ready explanation by external causes which is so frequently applied to the latter. Writers on the races of mankind have too often to trust to the information of travellers who pass rapidly from country to country, and thus have few opportunities of becoming acquainted with peculiarities of national character, or even of ascertaining what is really the average physical conformation of the people. Such are exceedingly apt to be deceived in places where two races have long, intermingled, by looking on intermediate forms and mixed habits as evidences of a natural transition from one race to the other, instead of an artificial mixture of two distinct peoples; and they will be the more readily led into this error if, as in the present case, writers on the subject should have been in the habit of classing these races as mere varieties of one stock, as closely related in physical conformation as from their geographical proximity one might suppose they ought to be. So far as I have yet seen, the Malay and Papuan appear to be as widely separated as any two human races that exist, being distinguished by physical, mental, and moral characteristics, all of the most marked and striking kind.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Feb 5th. -- I took advantage of a very fine calm day to pay a visit to the island of Wokan, which is about a mile from us, and forms part of the \"canna busar,\" or mainland of Aru. This is a large island, extending from north to south about a hundred miles, but so low in many parts as to be intersected by several creeks, which run completely through it, offering a passage for good- sized vessels. On the west side, where we are, there are only a few outlying islands, of which ours (Wamma) is the principal; but on the east coast are a great number of islands, extending some miles beyond the mainland, and forming the \"blakang tang,\" or \"back country,\" of the traders, being the principal seat of the pearl, tripang, and tortoiseshell fisheries. To the mainland many of the birds and animals of the country are altogether confined; the Birds of paradise, the black cockatoo, the great brush- turkey, and the cassowary, are none of them found on Wamma or any of the detached islands. I did not, however, expect in this excursion to see any decided difference in the forest or its productions, and was therefore agreeably surprised. The beach was overhung with the drooping branches of lame trees, loaded with Orchideae, ferns, and other epiphytal plants. In the forest there was more variety, some parts being dry, and with trees of a lower growth, while in others there were some of the most beautiful palms I have ever seen, with a perfectly straight, smooth, slender stem, a hundred feet high, and a crown of handsome drooping leaves. But the greatest novelty and most striking feature to my eyes were the tree-ferns, which, after seven years spent in the tropics, I now saw in perfection for the first time. All I had hitherto met with were slender species, not more than twelve feet high, and they gave not the least idea of the supreme beauty of trees bearing their elegant heads of fronds more than thirty feet in the air, like those which were plentifully scattered about this forest. There is nothing in tropical vegetation so perfectly beautiful.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My boys shot five sorts of birds, none of which we had obtained during a month\\'s shooting in Wamma. Two were very pretty flycatchers, already known from New Guinea; one of them (Monarcha chrysomela), of brilliant black and bright orange colours, is by some authors considered to be the most beautiful of all flycatchers; the other is pure white and velvety black, with a broad fleshy ring round the eye of are azure blue colour; it is named the \"spectacled flycatcher\" (Monarcha telescopthalma), and was first found in New Guinea, along with the other, by the French naturalists during the voyage of the discovery-ship Coquille.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Feb. 18th. -- Before leaving Macassar, I had written to the Governor of Amboyna requesting him to assist me with the native chiefs of Aru. I now received by a vessel which had arrived from Amboyna a very polite answer informing me that orders had been sent to give me every assistance that I might require; and I was just congratulating myself on being at length able to get a boat and men to go to the mainland and explore the interior, when a sudden check carne in the form of a piratical incursion. A small prau arrived which had been attacked by pirates and had a man wounded. They were said to have five boats, but more were expected to be behind and the traders were all in consternation, fearing that their small vessels sent trading to the \"blakang tana\" would be plundered. The Aru natives were of course  dreadfully alarmed, as these marauders attack their villages, burn and murder, and carry away women and children for slaves. Not a man will stir from his village for some time, and I must remain still a prisoner in Dobbo. The Governor of Amboyna, out of pure kindness, has told the chiefs that they are to be responsible for my safety, so that they have au excellent excuse for refusing to stir.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Several praus went out in search of the pirates, sentinels were appointed, and watch-fires lighted on the beach to guard against the possibility of a night attack, though it was hardly thought they would be bold enough to attempt to plunder Dobbo. The next day the praus returned, and we had positive information that these scourges of the Eastern seas were really among us. One of Herr Warzbergen\\'s small praus also arrived in a sad plight. It had been attacked six days before, just as it was returning, from the \"blakang tana.\" The crew escaped in their small boat and hid in the jungle, while the pirates came up and plundered the vessel. They took away everything but the cargo of mother-of- pearl shell, which was too bulky for them. All the clothes and boxes of the men, and the sails and cordage of the prau, were cleared off. They had four large war boats, and fired a volley of musketry as they came up, and sent off their small boats to the attack. After they had left, our men observed from their concealment that three had stayed behind with a small boat; and being driven to desperation by the sight of the plundering, one brave fellow swam off armed only with his parang, or chopping- knife, and coming on them unawares made a desperate attack, killing one and wounding the other two, receiving himself numbers of slight wounds, and then swimming off again when almost exhausted. Two other prams were also plundered, and the crew of one of them murdered to a man. They are said to be Sooloo pirates, but have Bugis among them. On their way here they have devastated one of the small islands east of Ceram. It is now eleven years since they have visited Aru, and by thus making their attacks at long and uncertain intervals the alarm dies away, and they find a population for the most part unarmed and unsuspicious of danger. None of the small trading vessels now carry arms, though they did so for a year or two after the last attack, which was just the time when there was the least occasion for it. A week later one of the smaller pirate boats was captured in the \"blakang tana.\" Seven men were killed and three taken prisoners. The larger vessels have been often seen but cannot be caught, as they have very strong crews, and can always escape by rowing out to sea in the eye of the wind, returning at night. They will thus remain among the innumerable islands and channels, till the change of the monsoon enables them to sail westward.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0March 9th. -- For four or five days we have had a continual gale of wind, with occasional gusts of great fury, which seem as if they would send Dobbo into the sea. Rain accompanies it almost every alternate hour, so that it is not a pleasant time. During such weather I can do little, but am busy getting ready a boat I have purchased, for an excursion into the interior. There is immense difficulty about men, but I believe the \"Orang-kaya,\" or head man of Wamma,  will accompany me to see that I don\\'t run into danger.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Having become quite an old inhabitant of Dobbo, I will endeavour to sketch the sights and sounds that pervade it, and the manners and customs of its inhabitants. The place is now pretty full, and the streets present a far more cheerful aspect than when we first arrived. Every house is a store, where the natives barter their produce for what they are most in need of. Knives, choppers, swords, guns, tobacco, gambier, plates, basins, handkerchiefs, sarongs, calicoes, and arrack, are the principal articles wanted by the natives; but some of the stores contain also tea, coffee, sugar, wine, biscuits, &c., for the supply of the traders; and others are full of fancy goods, china ornaments, looking-glasses, razors, umbrellas, pipes, and purses, which take the fancy of the wealthier natives. Every fine day mats are spread before the doors and the tripang is put out to dry, as well as sugar, salt, biscuit, tea, cloths, and other things that get injured by an excessively moist atmosphere. In the morning and evening, spruce Chinamen stroll about or chat at each other\\'s doors, in blue trousers, white jacket, and a queue into which red silk is plaited till it reaches almost to their heels. An old Bugis hadji regularly takes an evening stroll in all the dignity of flowing green silk robe and gay turban, followed by two small boys carrying his sirih and betel boxes.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In every vacant space new houses are being built, and all sorts of odd little cooking-sheds are erected against the old ones, while in some out-of-the-way corners, massive log pigsties are tenanted by growing porkers; for how can the Chinamen exist six months without one feast of pig?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here and there are stalls where bananas are sold, and every morning two little boys go about with trays of sweet rice and crated cocoa-nut, fried fish, or fried plantains; and whichever it may be, they have but one cry, and that is \"Chocolat-t--t!\" This must be a Spanish or Portuguese cry, handed down for centuries, while its meaning has been lost. The Bugis sailors, while hoisting the main sail, cry out, \"Vela a vela,-- vela, vela, vela!\" repeated in an everlasting chorus. As \"vela\" is Portuguese a sail, I supposed I had discovered the origin of this, but I found afterwards they used the same cry when heaving anchor, and often chanted it to \"hela,\" which is so much an universal expression of exertion and hard breathing that it is most probably a mere interjectional cry.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I daresay there are now near five hundred people in Dobbo of various races, all met in this remote corner of the East, as they express it, \"to look for their fortune;\" to get money any way they can. They are most of them people who have the very worst reputation for honesty as well as every other form of morality,-- Chinese, Bugis, Ceramese, and half-caste Javanese, with a sprinkling of half-wild Papuans from Timor, Babber, and other islands, yet all goes on as yet very quietly. This motley, ignorant, bloodthirsty, thievish population live here without the shadow of a government, with no police, no courts, and no lawyers; yet they do not cut each other\\'s throats, do not plunder each other day and night, do not fall into the anarchy such a state of things might be supposed to lead to. It is very extraordinary! It puts strange thoughts into one\\'s head about the mountain-load of government under which people exist in Europe, and suggests the idea that we may be over-governed. Think of the hundred Acts of Parliament annually enacted to prevent us, the people of England, from cutting each other\\'s throats, or from doing to our neighbour as we would not be done by. Think of the thousands of lawyers and barristers whose whole lives are spent in telling us what the hundred Acts of Parliament mean, and one would be led to infer that if Dobbo has too little law England has too much.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here we may behold in its simplest form the genius of Commerce at the work of Civilization. Trade is the magic that keeps all at peace, and unites these discordant elements into a well-behaved community. All are traders, and know that peace and order are essential to successful trade, and thus a public opinion is created which puts down all lawlessness. Often in former year, when strolling along the Campong Glam in Singapore, I have thought how wild and ferocious the Bugis sailors looked, and how little should like to trust myself among them. But now I find them to be very decent, well-behaved fellows; I walk daily unarmed in the jungle, where I meet them continually; I sleep in a palm-leaf hut, which any one may enter, with as little fear and as little danger of thieves or murder as if I were under the protection of the Metropolitan police. It is true the Dutch influence is felt here. The islands are nominally under the government of the Moluccas, which the native chiefs acknowledge; and in most years a commissioner arrives from Amboyna, who makes the tour of the islands, hears complaints, settle disputes, and carries away prisoner any heinous offender. This year he is not expected to come, as no orders have yet been received to prepare for him; so the people of Dobbo will probably be left to their own devices. One day a man was caught in the act of stealing a piece of iron from Herr Warzbergen\\'s house, which he had entered by making a hole through the thatch wall. In the evening the chief traders of the place, Bugis and Chinese, assembled, the offender was tried and found guilty, and sentenced to receive twenty lashes on the spot. They were given with a small rattan in the middle of the street, not very severely, the executioner appeared to sympathise a little with the culprit. The disgrace seemed to be thought as much of as the pain; for though any amount of clever cheating is thought rather meritorious than otherwise, open robbery and housebreaking meet with universal reprobation.\\nTHE ARU ISLANDS - JOURNEY AND RESIDENCE IN THE INTERIOR\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(MARCH TO MAY 1857)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0MY boat was at length ready, and having obtained two men besides my own servants, after an enormous amount of talk and trouble, we left Dobbo on the morning of March 13th, for the mainland of Aru. By noon we reached the mouth of a small river or creek, which we ascended, winding among mangrove, swamps, with here and there a glimpse of dry land. In two hours we reached a house, or rather small shed, of the most miserable description, which our steersman, the \"Orang-kaya\" of Wamma, said was the place we were to stay at, and where he had assured me we could get every kind of bird and beast to be found in Aru. The shed was occupied by about a dozen men, women, and children; two cooking fires were burning in it, and there seemed little prospect of my obtaining any accommodation. I however deferred inquiry till I had seen the neighbouring forest, and immediately started off with two men, net, and guns, along a path at the back of the house. In an hour\\'s walk I saw enough to make me determine to give the place a trial, and on my return, finding the \"Orang-kaya\" was in a strong fever-fit and unable to do anything, I entered into negotiations with the owner of the house for the use of a slip at one end of it about five feet wide, for a week, and agreed to pay as rent one \"parang,\" or chopping-knife. I then immediately got my boxes and bedding out of the boat, hung up a shelf for my bird-skins and insects, and got all ready for work next morning. My own boys slept in the boat to guard the remainder of my property; a cooking place sheltered by a few mats was arranged under a tree close by, and I felt that degree of satisfaction and enjoyment which I always experience when, after much trouble and delay, I am on the point of beginning work in a new locality.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0One of my first objects was to inquire for the people who are accustomed to shoot the Paradise birds. They lived at some distance in the jungle, and a man was sent to call them. When they arrived, we had a talk by means of the \"Orang-kaya \"as interpreter, and they said they thought they could get some. They explained that they shoot the birds with a bow and arrow, the arrow having a conical wooden cap fitted to the end as large as a teacup, so as to kill the bird by the violence of the blow without making any wound or shedding any blood. The trees frequented by the birds are very lofty; it is therefore necessary to erect a small leafy covering or hut among the branches, to which the hunter mounts before daylight in the morning and remains the whole day, and whenever a bird alights they are almost sure of securing it. (See Frontispiece.) They returned to their homes the same evening, and I never saw anything more of them, owing, as I afterwards found, to its being too early to obtain birds in good plumage.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The first two or three days of our stay here were very wet, and I obtained but few insects or birds, but at length, when I was beginning to despair, my boy Baderoon returned one day with a specimen which repaid me for months of delay and expectation. It was a small bird a little less than a thrush. The greater part of its plumage was of an intense cinnabar red, with a gloss as of spun glass. On the head the feathers became short and velvety, and shaded into rich orange. Beneath, from the breast downwards, was pure white, with the softness and gloss of silk, and across the breast a band of deep metallic green separated this colour from the red of the throat. Above each eye was a round spot of the same metallic green; the bill was yellow, and the feet and legs were of a fine cobalt ó111e, strikingly contrasting with all the other parts of the body. Merely in arrangement of colours and texture of plumage this little bird was a gem of the first water, yet there comprised only half its strange beauty.  Springing from each side of the breast, and ordinarily lying concealed under the wings, were little tufts of greyish feathers about two inches long, and each terminated by a broad band of intense emerald green. These plumes can be raised at the will of the bird, and spread out into a pair of elegant fans when the wings are elevated. But this is not the only ornament. The two middle feathers of the tail are in the form of slender wires about five inches long, and which diverge in a beautiful double curve. About half an inch of the end of this wire is webbed on the outer side only, awe coloured of a fine metallic green, and being curled spirally inwards form a pair of elegant glittering buttons, hanging five inches below the body, and the same distance apart. These two ornaments, the breast fans and the spiral tipped tail wires, are altogether unique, not occurring on any other species of the eight thousand different birds that are known to exist upon the earth; and, combined with the most exquisite beauty of plumage, render this one of the most perfectly lovely of the many lovely productions of nature. My transports of admiration and delight quite amused my Aru hosts, who saw nothing more in the \"Burong raja\" than we do in the robin of the goldfinch. [footnote: See the upper figure on Plate at commencement of Chapter XXXVIII.]\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Thus one of my objects in coming to the far fast was accomplished. I had obtained a specimen of the King Bird of Paradise (Paradisea regia), which had been described by Linnaeus from skins preserved in a mutilated state by the natives. I knew how few Europeans had ever beheld the perfect little organism I now gazed upon, and how very imperfectly it was still known in Europe. The emotions excited in the minds of a naturalist, who has long desired to see the actual thing which he has hitherto known only by description, drawing, or badly-preserved external covering--especially when that thing is of surpassing rarity and beauty, require the poetic faculty fully to express them. The remote island in which I found myself situated, in an almost unvisited sea, far from the tracks of merchant fleets and navies; the wild luxuriant tropical forest, which stretched far away on every side; the rude uncultured savages who gathered round me,-- all had their influence in determining the emotions with which I gazed upon this \"thing of beauty.\" I thought of the long ages of the past, during which the successive generations of this little creature had run their course--year by year being born, and living and dying amid these dark and gloomy woods, with no intelligent eye to gaze upon their loveliness; to all appearance such a wanton waste of beauty. Such ideas excite a feeling of melancholy. It seems sad, that on the one hand such exquisite creatures should live out their lives and exhibit their charms only in these wild inhospitable regions, doomed for ages yet to come to hopeless barbarism; while on the other hand, should civilized man ever reach these distant lands, and bring moral, intellectual, and physical light into the recesses of these virgin forests, we may be sure that he will so disturb the nicely-balanced relations of organic and inorganic nature as to cause the disappearance, and finally the extinction, of these very beings whose wonderful structure and beauty he alone is fitted to appreciate and enjoy. This consideration must surely tell us that all living things were _not_ made for man. Many of them have no relation to him. The cycle of their existence has gone on independently of his, and is disturbed or broken by every advance in man\\'s intellectual development; and their happiness and enjoyment, their loves and hates, their struggles for existence, their vigorous life and early death, would seem to be immediately related to their own well-being and perpetuation alone, limited only by the equal well-being and perpetuation of the numberless other organisms with which each is more or less intimately connected.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After the first king-bird was obtained, I went with my men into the forest, and we were not only rewarded with another in equally perfect plumage, but I was enabled to see a little of the habits of both it and the larger species. It frequents the lower trees of the less dense forests: and is very active, flying strongly with a whirring sound, and continually hopping or flying from branch to branch. It eats hard stone-bearing fruits as large as a gooseberry, and often flutters its wings after the manner of the South American manakins, at which time it elevates and expands the beautiful fans with which its breast is adorned. The natives of Aru call it \"Goby-goby.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0One day I get under a tree where a number of the Great Paradise birds were assembled, but they were high up in the thickest of the foliage, and flying and jumping about so continually that I could get no good view of them. At length I shot one, but it was a young specimen, and was entirely of a rich chocolate-brown colour, without either the metallic green throat or yellow plumes of the full-grown bird. All that I had yet seen resembled this, and the natives told me that it would be about two months before any would be found in full plumage. I still hoped, therefore, to get some. Their voice is most extraordinary. At early morn, before the sun has risen, we hear a loud cry of \"Wawk-wawk-wawk, wók-wók-wók,\" which resounds through the forest, changing its direction continually. This is the Great Bird of Paradise going to seek his breakfast. Others soon follow his example; lories and parroquets cry shrilly, cockatoos scream, king-hunters croak and bark, and the various smaller birds chirp and whistle their morning song. As I lie listening to these interesting sounds, I realize my position as the first European who has ever lived for months together in the Aru islands, a place which I had hoped rather than expected ever to visit. I think how many besides my self have longed to reach these almost fairy realms, and to see with their own eyes the many wonderful and beautiful things which I am daily encountering. But now Ali and Baderoon are up and getting ready their guns and ammunition, and little Brio has his fire lighted and is boiling my coffee, and I remember that I had a black cockatoo brought in late last night, which I must skin immediately, and so I jump up and begin my day\\'s work very happily.\\nHEAD OF BLACK COCKATOO\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This cockatoo is the first I have seen, and is a great prize. It has a rather small and weak body, long weak legs, large wings, and an enormously developed head, ornamented with a magnificent crest, and armed with a sharp-pointed hoofed bill of immense size and strength. The plumage is entirely black, but has all over it the curious powdery white secretion characteristic of cockatoo. The cheeks are bare, and of an intense blood-red colour. Instead of the harsh scream of the white cockatoos, its voice is a somewhat plaintive whistle. The tongue is a curious organ, being a slender fleshy cylinder of a deep red colour, terminated by a horny black plate, furrowed across and somewhat prehensile. The whole tongue has a considerable extensile power. I will here relate something of the habits of this bird, with which I have since become acquainted. It frequents the lower parts of the forest, and is seen singly, or at most two or three together. It flies slowly and noiselessly, and may be killed by a comparatively slight wound. It eats various fruits arid seeds, but seems more particularly attached to the kernel of the kanary- nut, which grows on a lofty forest tree (Canarium commune), abundant in the islands where this bird is found; and the manner in which it gets at these seeds shows a correlation of structure and habits, which would point out the \"kanary\" as its special food. The shell of this nut is so excessively hard that only a heavy hammer will crack it; it is somewhat triangular, and the outside is quite smooth. The manner in which the bird opens these nuts is very curious. Taking one endways in its bill and keeping it firm by a pressure of the tongue, it cuts a transverse notch by a lateral sawing motion of the sharp-edged lower mandible. This done, it takes hold of the nut with its foot, and biting off a piece of leaf retains it in the deep notch of the upper mandible, and again seizing the nut, which is prevented from slipping by the elastic tissue of the leaf, fixes the edge of the lower mandible in the notch, and by a powerful nip breaks of a piece of the shell. again taking the nut in its claws, it inserts the very long and sharp point of the bill and picks out the kernel, which is seized hold of, morsel by morsel, by the extensible tongue. Thus every detail of form. and structure in the extraordinary bill of this bird seems to have its use, and we may easily conceive that the black cockatoos have maintained themselves in competition with their more active and more numerous white allies, by their power of existing on a kind of food which no other bird is able to extract from its stony shell. The species is the Microglossum aterrimum of naturalists.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0During the two weeks which I spent in this little settlement, I had good opportunities of observing the natives at their own home, and living in their usual manner. There is a great monotony and uniformity in everyday savage life, and it seemed to me a more miserable existence than when it had the charm of novelty. To begin with the most important fact in the existence of uncivilized peoples--their food--the Aru men have no regular supply, no staff of life, such as bread, rice, mandiocca, maize, or sago, which are the daily food of a large proportion of mankind. They have, however, many sorts of vegetables, plantains, yams, sweet potatoes, and raw sago; and they chew up vast quantities of sugar-cane, as well as betel-nuts, gambir, and tobacco. Those who live on the coast have plenty of fish; but when inland, as we are here, they only go to the sea occasionally, and then bring home cockles and other shell-fish by the boatload. Now and then they get wild pig or kangaroo, but too rarely to form anything like a regular part of their diet, which is essentially vegetable; and what is of more importance, as affecting their health, green, watery vegetables, imperfectly cooked, and even these in varying and often in sufficient quantities. To this diet may be attributed the prevalence of skin diseases, and ulcers on the legs and joints. The scurfy skin disease so common among savages has a close connexion with the poorness and irregularity of their living. The Malays, who are never without their daily rice, are generally free from it; the hill-Dyaks of Borneo, who grow rice and live well, are clean skinned while the less industrious and less cleanly tribes, who live for a portion of the year on fruits and vegetables only, are very subject to this malady. It seems clear that in this, as in other respects, man is not able to make a beast of himself with impunity, feeding like the cattle on the herbs and fruits of the earth, and taking no thought of the morrow. To maintain his health and beauty he must labour to prepare some farinaceous product capable of being stored and accumulated, so as to give him a regular supply of wholesome food. When this is obtained, he may add vegetables, fruits, and meat with advantage.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The chief luxury of the Aru people, besides betel and tobacco, is arrack (Java rum), which the traders bring in great quantities and sell very cheap. A day\\'s fishing or rattan cutting will purchase at least a half-gallon bottle; and when the tripang or birds\\' nests collected during a season are sold, they get whole boxes, each containing fifteen such bottles, which the inmates of a house will sit round day and night till they have finished. They themselves tell me that at such bouts they often tear to pieces the house they are in, break and destroy everything they can lay their hands on, and make such an infernal riot as is alarming to behold.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The houses and furniture are on a par with the food. A rude shed, supported on rough and slender sticks rather than posts, no walls, but the floor raised to within a foot of the eaves, is the style of architecture they usually adopt. Inside there are partition walls of thatch, forming little boxes or sleeping places, to accommodate the two or three separate families that usually live together. A few mats, baskets, and cooking vessels, with plates and basins purchased from the Macassar traders, constitute their whole furniture; spears and bows are their weapons; a sarong or mat forms the clothing of the women, a waistcloth of the men. For hours or even for days they sit idle in their houses, the women bringing in the vegetables or sago which form their food. Sometimes they hunt or fish a little, or work at their houses or canoes, but they seem to enjoy pure idleness, and work as little as they can. They have little to vary the monotony of life, little that can be called pleasure, except idleness and conversation. And they certainly do talk! Every evening there is a little Babel around me: but as I understand not a word of it, I go on with my book or work undisturbed. Now and then they scream and shout, or laugh frantically for variety; and this goes on alternately with vociferous talking of men, women, and children, till long after I am in my mosquito curtain and sound asleep.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At this place I obtained some light on the complicated mixture of races in Aru, which would utterly confound an ethnologist. Many of the, natives, though equally dark with the others, have little of the Papuan physiognomy, but have more delicate features of the European type, with more glossy, curling hair: These at first quite puzzled me, for they have no more resemblance to Malay than to Papuan, and the darkness of skin and hair would forbid the idea of Dutch intermixture. Listening to their conversation, however, I detected some words that were familiar to me. \"Accabó\" was one; and to be sure that it was not an accidental resemblance, I asked the speaker in Malay what \"accabó\" meant, and was told it meant \"done or finished,\" a true Portuguese word, with its meaning retained. Again, I heard the word \"jafui\" often repeated, and could see, without inquiry, that its meaning was \"he\\'s gone,\" as in Portuguese. \"Porco,\" too, seems a common name, though the people have no idea of its European meaning. This cleared up the difficulty. I at once understood that some early Portuguese traders had penetrated to these islands, and mixed with the natives, influencing their language, and leaving in their descendants for many generations the visible characteristics of their race. If to this we add the occasional mixture of Malay, Dutch, and Chinese with the indigenous Papuans, we have no reason to wonder at the curious varieties of form and feature occasionally to be met with in Aru. In this very house there was a Macassar man, with an Aru wife and a family of mixed children. In Dobbo I saw a Javanese and an Amboyna man, each with an Aru wife and family; and as this kind of mixture has been going on for at least three hundred years, and probably much longer, it has produced a decided effect on the physical characteristics of a considerable portion of the population of the islands, more especially in Dobbo and the parts nearest to it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0March 28th. -- The \"Orang-kaya\" being very ill with fever had begged to go home, and had arranged with one of the men of the house to go on with me as his substitute. Now that I wanted to move, the bugbear of the pirates was brought up, and it was pronounced unsafe to go further than the next small river. This world not suit me, as I had determined to traverse the channel called Watelai to the \"blakang-tana;\" but my guide was firm in his dread of pirates, of which I knew there was now no danger, as several vessels had gone in search of them, as well as a Dutch gunboat which had arrived since I left Dobbo. I had, fortunately, by this time heard that the Dutch \"Commissie\" had really arrived, and therefore threatened that if my guide did not go with me immediately, I would appeal to the authorities, and he would certainly be obliged to gig a back the cloth which the \"Orang- kaya\" had transferred to him in prepayment. This had the desired effect; matters were soon arranged, and we started the next morning. The wind, however, was dead against us, and after rowing hard till midday we put in to a small river where there were few huts, to cook our dinners. The place did not look very promising, but as we could not reach our destination, the Watelai river, owing to the contrary wind, I thought we might as well wait here a day or two. I therefore paid a chopper for the use of a small shed, and got my bed and some boxes on shore. In the evening, after dark, we were suddenly alarmed by the cry of \"Bajak! bajak!\" (Pirates!) The men all seized their bows and spears, and rushed down to the beach; we got hold of our guns and prepared for action, but in a few minutes all came back laughing and chattering, for it had proved to be only a small boat and some of their own comrades returned from fishing. When all was quiet again, one of the men, who could speak a little Malay, came to me and begged me not to sleep too hard. \"Why?\" said I. \"Perhaps the pirates may really come,\" said he very seriously, which made me laugh and assure him I should sleep as hard as I could.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Two days were spent here, but the place was unproductive of insects or birds of interest, so we made another attempt to get on. As soon as we got a little away from the land we had a fair wind, and in six hours\\' sailing reached the entrance of the Watelai channel, which divides the most northerly from the middle portion of Aru. At its mouth this was about half a mile wide, but soon narrowed, and a mile or two on it assumed entirely the aspect of a river about the width of the Thames at London, winding among low but undulating and often hilly country. The scene was exactly such as might be expected in the interior of a continent. The channel continued of a uniform average width, with reaches and sinuous bends, one bank being often precipitous, or even forming vertical cliffs, while the other was flat and apparently alluvial; and it was only the pure salt-water, and the absence of any stream but the slight flux and reflux of the tide, that would enable a person to tell that he was navigating a strait and not a river. The wind was fair, and carried us along, with occasional assistance from our oars, till about three in the afternoon, when we landed where a little brook formed two or three basins in the coral rock, and then fell in a miniature cascade into the salt water river. Here we bathed and cooked our dinner, and enjoyed ourselves lazily till sunset, when we pursued our way for two hours snore, and then moored our little vessel to an overhanging tree for the night.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At five the next morning we started again, and in an hour overtook four large praus containing the \"Commissie,\" who had come from Dobbo to make their official tour round the islands, and had passed us in the eight. I paid a visit to the Dutchmen, one of whom spoke a little English, but we found that we could get on much better with Malay. They told me that they had been delayed going after the pirates to one of the northern islands, and had seen three of their vessels but could not catch them, because on being pursued they rowed out in the wind\\'s eye, which they are enabled to do by having about fifty oars to each boat. Having had some tea with thorn, I bade them adieu, and turned up a narrow channel which our pilot said would take us to the village of Watelai, on the west side- of Are. After going some miles we found the channel nearly blocked up with coral, so that our boat grated along the bottom, crunching what may truly be called the living rock. Sometimes all hands had to get out and wade, to lighten the vessel and lift it over the shallowest places; but at length we overcame all obstacles and reached a wide bay or estuary studded with little rocks and islets, and opening to the western sea and the numerous islands of the \"blakang-tuna.\" I now found that the village we were going to was miles away; that we should have to go out to sea, and round a rocky point. A squall seemed coming on, and as I have a horror of small boats at sea, and from all I could learn Watelai village was not a place to stop at (no birds of Paradise being found there), I determined to return and go to a village I had heard of up a tributary of the Watelai river, and situated nearly in the centre of the mainland of Aru. The people there were said to be good, and to be accustomed to hunting and bird-catching, being too far inland to get any part of their food from the sea. While I was deciding this point the squall burst upon us, and soon raised a rolling sea in the shallow water, which upset an oil bottle and a lamp, broke some of my crockery, and threw us all into confusion. Rowing hard we managed to get back into the main river by dusk, and looked out for a place to cook our suppers. It happened to be high water, and a very high tide, so that every piece of sand or beach was covered, and it was with the greatest difficulty, and after much groping in the dark, that we discovered a little sloping piece of rock about two feet square on which to make a fire and cook some rice. The next day we continued our way back, and on the following day entered a stream on the south side of the Watelai river, and ascending to where navigation ceased found the little village of Wanumbai, consisting of two large houses surrounded by plantations, amid the virgin forests of Aru.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As I liked the look of the place, and was desirous of staying some time, I sent my pilot to try and make a bargain for house accommodation. The owner and chief man of the place made many excuses. First, be was afraid I would not like his house, and then was doubtful whether his son, who was away, would like his admitting me. I had a long talk with him myself, and tried to explain what I was doing, and how many things I would buy of them, and showed him my stock of heads, and knives, and cloth, and tobacco, all of which I would spend with his family and friends if he would give me house-room. He seemed a little staggered at this, and said he, would talk to his wife, and in the meantime I went for a little walk to see the neighbourhood. When I carne back, I again sent my pilot, saying that I would go away if he would not dive me part of his house. In about half an hour he returned with a demand for about half the cost of building a house, for the rent of a small portion of it for a few weeks. As the only difficulty now was a pecuniary one, I got out about ten yards of cloth, an axe, with a few beads and some tobacco, and sent them as my final offer for the part of the house which I had before pointed out. This was accepted after a little more talk, and I immediately proceeded to take possession.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The house was a good large one, raised as usual about seven feet on posts, the walls about three or four feet more, with a high- pitched roof. The floor was of bamboo laths, and in the sloping roof way an immense shutter, which could be lifted and propped up to admit light and air. At the end where this was situated the floor was raised about a foot, and this piece, about ten feet wide by twenty long, quite open to the rest of the house, was the portion I was to occupy. At one end of this piece, separated by a thatch partition, was a cooking place, with a clay floor and shelves for crockery. At the opposite end I had my mosquito curtain hung, and round the walls we arranged my boxes and other stores, fated up a table and seat, and with a little cleaning and dusting made the place look quite comfortable. My boat was then hauled up on shore, and covered with palm-leaves, the sails and oars brought indoors, a hanging-stage for drying my specimens erected outside the house and another inside, and my boys were set to clean their gnus and get ail ready for beginning work.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next day I occupied myself in exploring the paths in the immediate neighbourhood. The small river up which we had ascended ceases to be navigable at this point, above which it is a little rocky brook, which quite dries up in the hot season. There was now, however, a fair stream of water in it; and a path which was partly in and partly by the side of the water, promised well for insects, as I here saw the magnificent blue butterfly, Papilio ulysses, as well as several other fine species, flopping lazily along, sometimes resting high up on the foliage which drooped over the water, at others settling down on the damp rock or on the edges of muddy pools. A little way on several paths branched off through patches of second-growth forest to cane-fields, gardens, and scattered houses, beyond which again the dark wall of verdure striped with tree-trunks, marked out the limits of the primeval forests. The voices of many birds promised good shooting, and on my return I found that my boy s had already obtained two or three kinds I had not seen before; and in the evening a native brought me a rare and beautiful species of ground-thrush (Pitta novaeguinaeae) hitherto only known from New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As I improved my acquaintance with them I became much interested in these people, who are a fair sample of the true savage inhabitants of the Aru Islands, tolerably free from foreign admixture. The house I lived in contained four or five families, and there were generally from six to a dozen visitors besides. They kept up a continual row from morning till night--talking, laughing, shouting, without intermission--not very pleasant, but interesting as a study of national character. My boy Ali said to me, \"Banyak quot bitchara Orang Aru \"(The Aru people are very strong talkers), never having been accustomed to such eloquence either in his own or any other country he had hitherto visited. Of an evening the men, having got over their first shyness, began to talk to me a little, asking about my country, &c., and in return I questioned them about any traditions they had of their own origin. I had, however, very little success, for I could not possibly make them understand the simple question of where the Aru people first came from. I put it in every possible way to them, but it was a subject quite beyond their speculations; they had evidently never thought of anything of the kind, and were unable to conceive a thing so remote and so unnecessary to be thought about, as their own origin. Finding this hopeless, I asked if they knew when the trade with Aru first began, when the Bugis and Chinese and Macassar men first came in their praus to buy tripang and tortoise-shell, and birds\\' nests, arid Paradise birds?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This they comprehended, but replied that there had always been the same trade as long as they or their fathers recollected, but that this was the first time a real white man had come among them, and, said they, \"You see how the people come every day from all the villages round to look at you.\" This was very flattering, and accounted for the great concourse of visitors which I had at first imagined was accidental. A few years before I had been one of the gazers at the Zoolus, and the Aztecs in London. Now the tables were turned upon me, for I was to these people a new and strange variety of man, and had the honour of affording to them, in my own person, an attractive exhibition, gratis.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All the men and boys of Aru are expert archers, never stirring without their bows and arrows. They shoot all sorts of birds, as well as pigs and kangaroos occasionally, and thus have a tolerably good supply of meat to eat with their vegetables. The result of this better living is superior healthiness, well-made bodies, and generally clear skins. They brought me numbers of small birds in exchange for beads or tobacco, but mauled them terribly, notwithstanding my repeated instructions. When they got a bird alive they would often tie a string to its leg, and keep it a day or two, till its plumage was so draggled and dirtied as to be almost worthless. One of the first things I got from there was a living specimen of the curious and beautiful racquet-tailed kingfisher. Seeing how much I admired it, they afterwards brought me several more, which wore all caught before daybreak, sleeping in cavities of the rocky banks of the stream. My hunters also shot a few specimens, and almost all of them had the red bill more or less clogged with mud and earth. This indicates the habits of the bird, which, though popularly a king-fisher, never catches fish, but lives on insects and minute shells, which it picks up in the forest, darting down upon them from its perch on some low branch. The genus Tanysiptera, to which this bird belongs, is remarkable for the enormously lengthened tail, which in all other kingfishers is small and short. Linnaeus named the species known to him \"the goddess kingfisher\" (Alcedo dea), from its extreme grace and beauty, the plumage being brilliant blue and white, with the bill red, like coral. Several species of these interesting birds are now known, all confined within the very limited area which comprises the Moluccas, New Guinea, and the extreme North of Australia. They resemble each other so closely that several of them can only be distinguished by careful comparison. One of the rarest, however, which inhabits New Guinea, is very distinct from the rest, being bright red beneath instead of white. That which I now obtained was a new one, and has been named Tanysiptera hydrocharis, but in general form and coloration it is exactly similar to the larger species found in Amboyna, and figured at page 468 of my first volume.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0New and interesting birds were continually brought in, either by my own boys or by the natives, and at the end of a week Ali arrived triumphant one afternoon with a fine specimen of the Great Bird of Paradise. The ornamental plumes had not yet attained their full growth, but the richness of their glossy orange colouring, and the exquisite delicacy of the loosely waving feathers, were unsurpassable. At the same time a great black cockatoo was brought in, as well as a fine fruit-pigeon and several small birds, so that we were all kept hard at work skinning till sunset. Just as we had cleared away and packed up for the night, a strange beast was brought, which had been shot by the natives. It resembled in size, and in its white woolly covering, a small fat lamb, but had short legs, hand-like feet with large claws, and a long prehensile tail. It was a Cuscus (C. maculatus), one of the curious marsupial animals of the Papuan region, and I was very desirous to obtain the skin. The owners, however, said they wanted to eat it; and though I offered them a good price, and promised to give them all the meat, there was grout hesitation. Suspecting the reason, I offered, though it was night, to set to work immediately and get out the body for them, to which they agreed. The creature was much hacked about, and the two hind feet almost cut off; but it was the largest and finest specimen of the kind I had seen; and after an hour\\'s hard work I handed over the body to the owners, who immediately cut it up and roasted it for supper.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As this was a very good place for birds, I determined to remain a month longer, and took the opportunity of a native boat going to Dobbo, to send Ali for a fresh supply of ammunition and provisions. They started on the 10th of April, and the house was crowded with about a hundred men, boys, women, and girls, bringing their loads of sugar-cane, plantains, sirih-leaf, yams, &c.; one lad going from each house to sell the produce and make purchases. The noise was indescribable. At least fifty of the hundred were always talking at once, and that not in the low measured tones of the apathetically polite Malay, but with loud voices, shouts, and screaming laughter, in which the women and children were even more conspicuous than the men. It was only while gazing at me that their tongues were moderately quiet, because their eyes were fully occupied. The black vegetable soil here overlying the coral rock is very rich, and the sugar-cane was finer than any I had ever seen. The canes brought to the boat were often ten and even twelve feet long, and thick in proportion, with short joints throughout, swelling between the knots with the, abundance of the rich juice. At Dobbo they get a high price for it, 1d. to 3d. a stick, and there is an insatiable demand among the crews of the praus and the Baba fishermen. Here they eat it continually. They half live on it, and sometimes feed their pigs with it. Near every house are great heaps of the refuse cane; and large wicker-baskets to contain this refuse as it is produced form a regular part of the furniture of a house. Whatever time of the day you enter, you are sure to find three or four people with a yard of cane in one hand, a knife in the other, and a basket between their legs, hacking, paring, chewing, and basket-filling, with a persevering assiduity which reminds one of a hungry cow grazing, or of a caterpillar eating up a leaf.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After five days absence the boats returned from Dobbo, bringing Ali and all the things I had sent for quite safe. A large party had assembled to be ready to carry home the goods brought, among which were a good many cocoa-nut, which are a great luxury here. It seems strange that they should never plant them; but the reason simply is, that they cannot bring their hearts to bury a good nut for the prospective advantage of a crop twelve years hence. There is also the chance of the fruits being dug up and eaten unless watched night and day. Among the things I had sent for was a box of arrack, and I was now of course besieged with requests for a little drop. I gave them a flask (about two bottles, which was very soon finished, and I was assured that there were many present who had not had a taste. As I feared my box would very soon be emptied if I supplied all their demands, I told them I had given them one, but the second they must pay for, and that afterwards I must have a Paradise bird for each flask. They immediately sent round to all the neighbouring houses, and mustered up a rupee in Dutch copper money, got their second flask, and drunk it as quickly as the first, and were then very talkative, but less noisy and importunate than I had expected. Two or three of them got round me and begged me for the twentieth time to tell them the name of my country. Then, as they could not pronounce it satisfactorily, they insisted that I was deceiving them, and that it was a name of my own invention. One funny old man, who bore a ludicrous resemblance, to a friend of mine at home, was almost indignant. \"Ung-lung! \"said he, \"who ever heard of such a name?--ang lang--anger-lung--that can\\'t be the name of your country; you are playing with us.\" Then he tried to give a convincing illustration. \"My country is Wanumbai--anybody can say Wanumbai. I\\'m an ` orang-Wanumbai; but, N-glung! who ever heard of such a name? Do tell us the real name of your country, and then when you are gone we shall know how to talk about you.\" To this luminous argument and remonstrance I could oppose nothing but assertion, and the whole party remained firmly convinced that I was for some reason or other deceiving them. They then attacked me on another point--what all the animals and birds and insects and shells were preserved so carefully for. They had often asked me this before, and I had tried to explain to them that they would be stuffed, and made to look as if alive, and people in my country would go to look at them. But this was not satisfying; in my country there must be many better things to look at, and they could not believe I would take so much trouble with their birds and beasts just for people to look at. They did not want to look at them; and we, who made calico and glass and knives, and all sorts of wonderful things, could not want things from Aru to look at. They had evidently been thinking about it, and had at length got what seemed a very satisfactory theory; for the same old man said to me, in a low, mysterious voice, \"What becomes of them when you go on to the sea?\" \"Why, they are all packed up in boxes,\" said I \"What did you think became of them?\" \"They all come to life again, don\\'t they?\" said he; and though I tried to joke it off, and said if they did we should have plenty to eat at sea, he stuck to his opinion, and kept repeating, with an air of deep conviction, \"Yes, they all come to life again, that\\'s what they do--they all come to life again.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After a little while, and a good deal of talking among themselves, he began again--\"I know all about it--oh yes! Before you came we had rain every day--very wet indeed; now, ever since you have been here, it is fine hot weather. Oh, yes! I know all about it; you can\\'t deceive me.\" And so I was set down as a conjurer, and was unable to repel the charge. But the conjurer was completely puzzled by the next question: \"What,\" said the old man, \"is the great ship, where the Bugis and Chinamen go to sell their things? It is always in the great sea--its name is Jong; tell us all about it.\" In vain I inquired what they knew about it; they knew nothing but that it was called \"Jong,\" and was always in the sea, and was a very great ship, and concluded with, \"Perhaps that is your country?\" Finding that I could not or would not tell them anything about \"Jong,\" there came more regrets that I would not tell them the real name of my country; and then a long string of compliments, to the effect that I was a much better sort of a person than the Bugis and Chinese, who sometimes came to trade with them, for I gave them things for nothing, and did not try to cheat them. How long would I stop? was the next earnest inquiry. Would I stay two or three months? They would get me plenty of birds and animals, and I might soon finish all the goods I had brought, and then, said the old spokesman, \"Don\\'t go away, but send for more things from Dobbo, and stay here a year or two.\" And then again the old story, \"Do tell us the name of your country. We know the Bugis men, and the Macassar men, and the Java men, and the China men; only you, we don\\'t know from what country you come. Ung-lung! it can\\'t be; I know that is not the name of your country.\" Seeing no end to this long talk, I said I was tired, and wanted to go to sleep; so after begging-- one a little bit of dry fish for his supper, and another a little salt to eat with his sago--they went off very quietly, and I went outside and took a stroll round the house by moonlight, thinking of the simple people and the strange productions of Aru, and then turned in under my mosquito curtain; to sleep with a sense of perfect security in the midst of these good-natured savages.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now had seven or eight days of hot and dry weather, which reduced the little river to a succession of shallow pools connected by the smallest possible thread of trickling water. If there were a dry season like that of Macassar, the Aru Islands would be uninhabitable, as there is no part of them much above a hundred feet high; and the whole being a mass of porous coralline rock, allows the surface water rapidly to escape. The only dry season they have is for a month or two about September or October, and there is then an excessive scarcity of water, so that sometimes hundreds of birds and other animals die of drought. The natives then remove to houses near the sources of the small streams, where, in the shady depths of the forest, a small quantity of water still remains. Even then many of them have to go miles for their water, which they keep in large bamboos and use very sparingly. They assure me that they catch and kill game of all kinds, by watching at the water holes or setting snares around them. That would be the time for me to make my collections; but the want of water would be a terrible annoyance, and the impossibility of getting away before another whole year had passed made it out of the question.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Ever since leaving Dobbo I had suffered terribly from insects, who seemed here bent upon revenging my long-continued persecution of their race. At our first stopping-place sand-flies were very abundant at night, penetrating to every part of the body, and producing a more lasting irritation than mosquitoes. My feet and ankles especially suffered, and were completely covered with little red swollen specks, which tormented me horribly. On arriving here we were delighted to find the house free from sand- flies or mosquitoes, but in the plantations where my daily walks led me, the day-biting mosquitoes swarmed, and seemed especially to delight in attaching my poor feet. After a month\\'s incessant punishment, those useful members rebelled against such treatment and broke into open insurrection, throwing out numerous inflamed ulcers, which were very painful, and stopped me from walking. So I found myself confined to the house, and with no immediate prospect of leaving it. Wounds or sores in the feet are especially difficult to heal in hot climates, and I therefore dreaded them more than any other illness. The confinement was very annoying, as the fine hot weather was excellent for insects, of which I had every promise of obtaining a fine collection; and it is only by daily and unremitting search that the smaller kinds, and the rarer and more interesting specimens, can be obtained. When I crawled down to the river-side to bathe, I often saw the blue-winged Papilio ulysses, or some other equally rare and beautiful insect; but there was nothing for it but patience, and to return quietly to my bird-skinning, or whatever other work I had indoors. The stings and bites and ceaseless irritation caused by these pests of the tropical forests, would be borne uncomplainingly; but to be kept prisoner by them in so rich and unexplored a country where rare and beautiful creatures are to be met with in every forest ramble--a country reached by such a long and tedious voyage, and which might not in the present century be again visited for the same purpose--is a punishment too severe for a naturalist to pass over in silence.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I had, however, some consolation in the birds my boys brought home daily, more especially the Paradiseas, which they at length obtained in full plumage. It was quite a relief to my mind to get these, for I could hardly have torn myself away from Aru had I not obtained specimens.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But what I valued almost as much as the birds themselves was the knowledge of their habits, which I was daily obtaining both from the accounts of my hunters, and from the conversation of the natives. The birds had now commenced what the people here call their \"sacaleli,\" or dancing-parties, in certain trees in the forest, which are not fruit trees as I at first imagined, but which have an immense tread of spreading branches and large but scattered leaves, giving a clear space for the birds to play and exhibit their plumes. On one of these trees a dozen or twenty full-plumaged male birds assemble together, raise up their wings, stretch out their necks, and elevate their exquisite plumes, keeping them in a continual vibration. Between whiles they fly across from branch to branch in great excitement, so that the whole tree is filled with waving plumes in every variety of attitude and motion. (See Frontispiece.) The bird itself is nearly as large as a crow, and is of a rich coffee brown colour. The head and neck is of a pure straw yellow above and rich metallic green beneath. The long plumy tufts of golden orange feathers spring from the sides beneath each wing, and when the bird is in repose are partly concealed by them. At the time of its excitement, however, the wings are raised vertically over tile back, the head is bent down and stretched out, and the long plumes are raised up and expanded till they form two magnificent golden fans, striped with deep red at the base, and fading off into the pale brown tint of the finely divided and softly waving points. The whole bird is then overshadowed by them, the crouching body, yellow head, and emerald green throat forming but the foundation and setting to the golden glory which waves above. When seen in this attitude, the Bird of Paradise really deserves its name, and must be ranked as one of the most beautiful and most wonderful of living things. I continued also to get specimens of the lovely little king-bird occasionally, as well as numbers of brilliant pigeons, sweet little parroquets, and many curious small birds, most nearly resembling those of Australia and New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Here, as among most savage people I have dwelt among, I was delighted with the beauty of the human form-a beauty of which stay-at-home civilized people can scarcely have any conception. What are the finest Grecian statues to the living, moving, breathing men I saw daily around me? The unrestrained grace of the naked savage as he goes about his daily occupations, or lounges at his ease, must be seen to be understood; and a youth bending his bow is the perfection of manly beauty. The women, however, except in extreme youth, are by no means so pleasant to look at as the men. Their strongly-marked features are very unfeminine, and hard work, privations, and very early marriages soon destroy whatever of beauty or grace they may for a short time possess. Their toilet is very simple, but also, I am sorry to say, very coarse, and disgusting. It consists solely of a mat of plaited strips of palm leaves, worn tight round the body, and reaching from the hips to the knees. It seems not to be changed till worn out, is seldom washed, and is generally very dirty. This is the universal dress, except in a few cases where Malay \"sarongs\" have come into use. Their frizzly hair is tied in a bench at the back of the head. They delight in combing, or rather forking it, using for that purpose a large wooden fork with four diverging prongs, which answers the purpose of separating and arranging the long tangled, frizzly mass of cranial vegetation much better than any comb could do. The only ornaments of the women are earrings and necklaces, which they arrange in various tasteful ways. The ends of a necklace are often attached to the earrings, and then looped on to the hair-knot behind. This has really an elegant appearance, the beads hanging gracefully on each side of the head, and by establishing a connexion with the earrings give an appearance of utility to those barbarous ornaments. We recommend this style to the consideration of those of the fair sex who still bore holes in their ears and hang rings thereto. Another style of necklace among these Papuan belles is to wear two, each hanging on one side of the neck and under the opposite arm, so as to cross each other. This has a very pretty appearance, in part due to the contrast of the white beads or kangaroo teeth of which they are composed with the dark glossy skin. The earrings themselves are formed of a bar of copper or silver, twisted so that the ends cross. The men, as usual among savages, adorn themselves more than the women. They wear necklaces, earrings, and finger rings, and delight in a band of plaited grass tight round the arm just below the shoulder, to which they attach a bunch of hair or bright coloured feathers by way of ornament. The teeth of small animals, either alone, or alternately with black or white beads, form their necklaces, and sometimes bracelets also. For these latter, however, they prefer brass wire, or the black, horny, wing-spines of the cassowary, which they consider a charm. Anklets of brass or shell, and tight plaited garters below the knee, complete their ordinary decorations.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some natives of Kobror from further south, and who are reckoned the worst and least civilized of the Aru tribes, came one day to visit us. They have a rather more than usually savage appearance, owing to the greater amount of ornaments they use--the most conspicuous being a large horseshoe-shaped comb which they wear over the forehead, the ends resting on the temples. The back of the comb is fastened into a piece of wood, which is plated with tin in front, and above is attached a plume of feathers from a cock\\'s tail. In other respects they scarcely differed from the people I was living with. They brought me a couple of birds, some shells and insects; showing that the report of the white man and his doing had reached their country. There was probably hardly a man in Aru who had not by this time heard of me.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Besides the domestic utensils already mentioned, the moveable property of a native is very scanty. He has a good supply of spears and bows and arrows for hunting, a parang, or chopping- knife, and an axe-for the stone age has passed away here, owing to the commercial enterprise of the Bugis and other Malay races. Attached to a belt, or hung across his shoulder, he carrion a little skin pouch and an ornamented bamboo, containing betel-nut, tobacco, and lime, and a small German wooden-handled knife is generally stuck between his waist-cloth of bark and his bare shin. Each man also possesses a °cadjan,\" or sleeping-mat, made of the broad leaves of a pandanus neatly sewn together in- three layers. This mat is abort four feet square, and when folded has one end sewn up, so that it forms a kind of sack open at one side. In the closed corner the head or feet can be placed, or by carrying it on the head in a shower it forms both coat and umbrella. It doubles up ix a small compass for convenient carriage, and then forms a light and elastic cushion, so that on a journey it becomes clothing, house, bedding, and furniture, all in one.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The only ornaments in an Aru horse are trophies of the chase-- jaws of wild pigs, the heads and backbones of cassowaries, and plumes made from the feathers of the Bird of Paradise, cassowary, and domestic fowl. The spears, shields, knife-handles, and other utensils are more or less carved in fanciful designs, and the mats and leaf boxes are painted or plaited in neat patterns of red, black, and yellow colours. I must not forget these boxes, which are most ingeniously made of the pith of a balm leaf pegged together, lined inside with pandanus leaves, and outside with the same, or with plaited grass. All the joints and angles are coffered with strips of split rattan sewn neatly on. The lid is covered with the brown leathery spathe of the Areca palm, which is impervious to water, and the whole box is neat, strong, and well finished. They are made from a few inches to two or three feet long, and being much esteemed by the Malay as clothes-boxes, are a regular article of export from Aru. The natives use the smaller ones for tobacco or betel-nut, but seldom have clothes enough to require the larger ones, which are only made for sale.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Among the domestic animals which may generally be seen in native houses, are gaudy parrots, green, red, and blue, a few domestic fowls, which have baskets hung for them to lay in under the eaves, and who sleep on the ridge, and several half-starved wolfish-baking dogs. Instead of rats and mice there are curious little marsupial animals about the same size, which run about at night and nibble anything eatable that may be left uncovered. Four or five different kinds of ants attack everything not isolated by water, and one kind even swims across that; great spiders lurk in baskets and boxes, or hide in the folds of my mosquito curtain; centipedes and millepedes are found everywhere. I have caught them under my pillow and on my bead; while in every box, and under every hoard which has lain for some days undisturbed, little scorpions are sure to be found snugly ensconced, with their formidable tails quickly turned up ready for attack or defence. Such companions seem very alarming and dangerous, but all combined are not so bad as the irritation of mosquitoes, or of the insect pests often found at home. These latter are a constant and unceasing source of torment and disgust, whereas you may live a long time among scorpions, spiders, and centipedes, ugly and venomous though they are, and get no harm from them. After living twelve years in the tropics, I have never yet been bitten or stung by either.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The lean and hungry dogs before mentioned were my greatest enemies, and kept me constantly on the watch. If my boys left the bird they were skinning for an instant, it was sure to be carried off. Everything eatable had to be hung up to the roof, to be out of their reach. Ali had just finished skinning a fine King Bird of Paradise one day, when he dropped the skin. Before he could stoop to pick it up, one of this famished race had seized upon it, and he only succeeded in rescuing it from its fangs after it was torn to tatters. Two skins of the large Paradisea, which were quite dry and ready to pack away, were incautiously left on my table for the night, wrapped up in paper. The next morning they were gone, and only a few scattered feathers indicated their fate. My hanging shelf was out of their reach; but having stupidly left a box which served as a step, a full-plumaged Paradise bird was next morning missing; and a dog below the house was to be seen still mumbling over the fragments, with the fine golden plumes all trampled in the mud. Every night, as soon as I was in bed, I could hear them searching about for what they could devour, under my table, and all about my boxes and baskets, keeping me in a state of suspense till morning, lest something of value might incautiously have been left within their read. They would drink the oil of my floating lamp and eat the wick, and upset or break my crockery if my lazy boys had neglected to wash away even the smell of anything eatable. Bad, however, as they are here, they were worse in a Dyak\\'s house in Borneo where I was once staying, for there they gnawed off the tops of my waterproof boots, ate a large piece out of an old leather game-bag, besides devouring a portion of my mosquito curtain!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0April 28th. -- Last evening we had a grand consultation, which had evidently been arranged and discussed beforehand. A number of the natives gathered round me, and said they wanted to talk. Two of the best Malay scholars helped each other, the rest putting in hints and ideas in their own language. They told me a long rambling story; but, partly owing to their imperfect knowledge of Malay, partly through my ignorance of local terms, and partly through the incoherence of their narrative, I could not make it out very clearly. It was, however, a tradition, and I was glad to find they had anything of the kind. A long time ago, they said, some strangers came to Aru, and came here to Wanumbai, and the chief of the Wanumbai people did not like them, and wanted them to go away, but they would not go, and so it came to fighting, and many Aru men were killed, and some, along with the chief, were taken prisoners, and carried away by the strangers. Some of the speakers, however, said that he was not carried away, but went away in his own boat to escape from the foreigners, and went to the sea and never came back again. But they all believe that the chief and the people that went with him still live in some foreign country; and if they could but find out where, they would send for them to come back again. Now having some vague idea that white men must know every country beyond the sea, they wanted to know if I had met their people in my country or in the sea. They thought they must be there, for they could not imagine where else they could be. They had sought for them everywhere, they said--on the land and in the sea, in the forest and on the mountains, in the air and in the sky, and could not find them; therefore, they must be in my country, and they begged me to tell them, for I must surely know, as I came from across the great sea. I tried to explain to them that their friends could not have reached my country in small boats; and that there were plenty of islands like Aru all about the sea, which they would be sure to find. Besides, as it was so long ago, the chief and all the people must be dead. But they quite laughed at this idea, and said they were sure they were alive, for they had proof of it. And then they told me that a good many years ago, when the speakers were boys, some Wokan men who were out fishing met these lost people in the sea, and spoke to them; and the chief gave the Wokan men a hundred fathoms of cloth to bring to the men of Wanumbai, to show that they were alive and would soon come back to them, but the Wokan men were thieves, and kept the cloth, and they only heard of it afterwards; and when they spoke about it, the Wokan men denied it, and pretended they had not received the cloth;--so they were quite sure their friends were at that time alive and somewhere in the sea. And again, not many years ago, a report came to them that some Bu0gis traders had brought some children of their lost people; so they went to Dobbo to see about it, and the owner of the house, who was now speaking to me, was one who went; but the Bugis roan would not let them see the children, and threatened to kill them if they came into his house. He kept the children shut up in a large box, and when he went away he took them with him. And at the end of each of these stories, they begged me in an imploring tone to tell them if I knew where their chief and their people now were.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0By dint of questioning, I got some account of the strangers who had taken away their people. They said they were wonderfully strong, and each one could kill a great many Aru men; and when they were wounded, however badly, they spit upon the place, and it immediately became well. And they made a great net of rattans, and entangled their prisoners in it, and sunk them in the water; and the next day, when they pulled the net up on shore, they made the drowned men come to life again, and carried them away.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Much more of the same kind was told me, but in so confused and rambling a manner that I could make nothing out of it, till I inquired how long ago it was that all this happened, when they told me that after their people were taken away the Bugis came in their praus to trade in Aru, and to buy tripang and birds\\' nests. It is not impossible that something similar to what they related to me really happened when the early Portuguese discoverers first carne to Aru, and has formed the foundation for a continually increasing accumulation of legend and fable. I have no doubt that to the next generation, or even before, I myself shall be transformed into a magician or a demigod, a worker of miracles, and a being of supernatural knowledge. They already believe that all the animals I preserve will come to life again; and to their children it will be related that they actually did so. An unusual spell of fine weather setting in just at my arrival has made them believe I can control the seasons; and the simple circumstance of my always walking alone in the forest is a wonder and a mystery to them, as well as my asking them about birds and animals I have not yet seen, and showing an acquaintance with their form, colours, and habits. These facts are brought against me when I disclaim knowledge of what they wish me to tell them. \"You must know,\" say they; \"you know everything: you make the fine weather for your men to shoot, and you know all about our birds and our animals as well as we do; and you go alone into the forest and are not afraid.\" Therefore every confession of ignorance on my part is thought to be a blind, a mere excuse to avoid telling them too much. My very writing materials and books are to them weird things; and were I to choose to mystify them by a few simple experiments with lens and magnet, miracles without end would in a few years cluster about me; and future travellers, penetrating to Wanumbai, world h hardly believe that a poor English naturalist, who had resided a few months among them, could have been the original of the supernatural being to whom so many marvels were attributed.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Far some days I had noticed a good deal of excitement, and many strangers came and went armed with spears and cutlasses, bows and shields. I now found there was war near us--two neighbouring villages having a quarrel about some matter of local politics that I could not understand. They told me it was quite a common thing, and that they are rarely without fighting somewhere near. Individual quarrels are taken up by villages and tribes, and the nonpayment of the stipulated price for a wife is one of the most frequent causes of bitterness and bloodshed. One of the war shields was brought me to look at. It was made of rattans and covered with cotton twist, so as to be both light, strong, and very tough. I should think it would resist any ordinary bullet. Abort the middle there was au arm-hole with a shutter or flap over it. This enables the arm to be put through and the bow drawn, while the body and face, up to the eyes, remain protected, which cannot be done if the shield is carried on the arm by loops attached at the back in the ordinary way. A few of the young men from our house went to help their friends, but I could not bear that any of them were hurt, or that there was much hard fighting.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0May 8th. - I had now been six weeks at Wanumbai, but for more than half the time was laid up in the house with ulcerated feet. My stores being nearly exhausted, and my bird and insect boxes full, and having no immediate prospect of getting the use of my legs again, I determined on returning to Dobbo. Birds had lately become rather scarce, and the Paradise birds had not yet become as plentiful as the natives assured me they would be in another month. The Wanumbai people seemed very sorry at my departure; and well they might be, for the shells and insects they picked up on the way to and from their plantations, and the birds the little boys shot with their bows and arrows, kept them all well supplied with tobacco and gambir, besides enabling them to accumulate a stock of beads and coppers for future expenses. The owner of the house was supplied gratis with a little rice, fish, or salt, whenever he asked for it, which I must say was not very often. On parting, I distributed among them my remnant stock of salt and tobacco, and gave my host a flask of arrack, and believe that on the whole my stay with these simple and good-natured people was productive of pleasure and profit to both parties. I fully intended to come back; and had I known that circumstances would have prevented my doing so, shoed have felt some sorrow in leaving a place where I had first seen so many rare and beautiful living things, and bad so fully enjoyed the pleasure which fills the heart of the naturalist when he is so fortunate as to discover a district hitherto unexplored, and where every day brings forth new and unexpected treasures. We loaded our boat in the afternoon, and, starting before daybreak, by the help of a fair wind reached Dobbo late the same evening.\\nTHE ARU ISLANDS - SECOND RESIDENCE AT DOBBO\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(MAY AND JUNE 1857)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0DOBBO was full to overflowing, and I was obliged to  occupy the court-house where the Commissioners hold their sittings. They had now left the island, and I found the situation agreeable, as it was at the end of the village, with a view down the principal street. It was a mere shed, but half of it had a roughly boarded floor, and by putting up a partition and opening a window I made it a very pleasant abode. In one of the boxes I had left in charge of Herr Warzbergen, a colony of small ants had settled and deposited millions of eggs. It was luckily a fine hot day, and by carrying the box some distance from the house, and placing every article in the sunshine for an hour or two, I got rid of them without damage, as they were fortunately a harmless species.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dobbo now presented an animated appearance. Five or six new houses had been added to the street; the praus were all brought round to the western side of the point, where they were hauled up on the beach, and were being caulked and covered with a thick white lime-plaster for the homeward voyage, making them the brightest and cleanest looking things in the place. Most of the small boats had returned from the \"blakang-tana \"(back country), as the side of the islands towards New Guinea is called. Piles of firewood were being heaped up behind the houses; sail-makers and carpenters were busy at work; mother-of-pearl shell was being tied up in bundles, and the black and ugly smoked tripang was having a last exposure to the sun before loading. The spare portion of the crews were employed cutting and squaring timber, and boats from Ceram and Goram were constantly unloading their cargoes of sago-cake for the traders\\' homeward voyage. The fowls, ducks, and goats all looked fat and thriving on the refuse food of a dense population, and the Chinamen\\'s pigs were in a state of obesity that foreboded early death. Parrots and Tories and cockatoos, of a dozen different binds, were suspended on bamboo perches at the doors of the houses, with metallic green or white fruit-pigeons which cooed musically at noon and eventide. Young cassowaries, strangely striped with black and brown, wandered about the houses or gambolled with the playfulness of kittens in the hot sunshine, with sometimes a pretty little kangaroo, caught in the Aru forests, but already tame and graceful as a petted fawn.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Of an evening there were more signs of life than at the time of my former residence. Tom-toms, jews\\'-harps, and even fiddles were to be heard, and the melancholy Malay songs sounded not unpleasantly far into the night. Almost every day there was a cock-fight in the street. The spectators make a ring, and after the long steel spurs are tied on, and the poor animals are set down to gash and kill each other, the excitement is immense. Those who lave made bets scream and yell and jump frantically, if they think they are going to win or lose, but in a very few minutes it is all over; there is a hurrah from the winners, the owners seize their cocks, the winning bird is caressed and admired, the loser is generally dead or very badly wounded, and his master may often be seen plucking out his feathers as he walks away, preparing him for the cooking pot while the poor bird is still alive.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A game at foot-ball, which generally took place at sunset, was, however, much more interesting to me. The ball used is a rather small one, and is made of rattan, hollow, light, and elastic. The player keeps it dancing a little while on his foot, then occasionally on his arm or thigh, till suddenly he gives it a good blow with the hollow of the foot, and sends it flying high in the air. Another player runs to meet it, and at its first bound catches it on his foot and plays in his turn. The ball must never be touched with the hand; but the arm, shoulder, knee, or thigh are used at pleasure to rest the foot. Two or three played very skilfully, keeping the ball continually flying about, but the place was too confined to show off the game to advantage. One evening a quarrel arose from some dispute in the game, and there was a great row, and it was feared there would be a fight about it--not two men only, but a party of a dozen or twenty on each side, a regular battle with knives and krisses; but after a large amount of talk it passed off quietly, and we heard nothing about it afterwards.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Most Europeans being gifted by nature with a luxuriant growth of hair upon their faces, think it disfigures them, and keep up a continual struggle against her by mowing down every morning the crop which has sprouted up flaring the preceding twenty-four hours. Now the men of Mongolian race are, naturally, just as many of us want to he. They mostly pass their lives with faces as smooth and beardless as an infant\\'s. But shaving seems an instinct of the human race; for many of these people, having no hair to take off their faces, shave their heads. Others, however, set resolutely to work to force nature to give them a beard. One of the chief cock-fighters at Dobbo was a Javanese, a sort of master of the ceremonies of the ring, who tied on the spars and acted as backer-up to one of the combatants. This man had succeeded, by assiduous cultivation, in raising a pair of moustaches which were a triumph of art, for they each contained about a dozen hairs more than three inches long, and which, being well greased and twisted, were distinctly visible (when not too far off) as a black thread hanging down on each side of his mouth. But the beard to match was the difficulty, for nature had cruelly refused to give him a rudiment of hair on his chin, and the most talented gardener could not do much if he had nothing to cultivate. But true genius triumphs over difficulties. Although there was no hair proper on the chin; there happened to be, rather on one side of it, a small mole or freckle which contained (as such things frequently do) a few stray hairs. These had been made the most of. They had reached four or five inches in length, and formed another black thread dangling from the left angle of the chin. The owner carried this as if it were something remarkable (as it certainly was); he often felt it affectionately, passed it between his fingers, and was evidently extremely proud of his moustaches and beard!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0One of the most surprising things connected with Aru was the excessive cheapness of all articles of European or native manufacture. We were here two thousand miles beyond Singapore and Batavia, which are themselves emporiums of the \"far east,\" in a place unvisited by, and almost unknown to, European traders; everything reached us through at least two or three hands, often many more; yet English calicoes and American cotton cloths could be bought for 8s. the piece, muskets for 15s., common scissors and German knives at three-halfpence each, and other cutlery, cotton goods, and earthenware in the same proportion. The natives of this out-of-the-way country can, in fact, buy all these things at about the same money price as our workmen at home, but in reality very much cheaper, for the produce of a few hours\\' labour enables the savage to purchase in abundance what are to him luxuries, while to the European they are necessaries of life. The barbarian is no happier and no better off for this cheapness. On the contrary, it has a most injurious effect on him. He wants the stimulus of necessity to force him to labour; and if iron were as dear as silver, and calico as costly as satin, the effect would be beneficial to him. As it is, he has more idle hours, gets a more constant supply of tobacco, and can intoxicate himself with arrack more frequently and more thoroughly; for your Aru man scorns to get half drunk-a tumbler full of arrack is but a slight stimulus, and nothing less than half a gallon of spirit will make him tipsy to his own satisfaction.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is not agreeable to reflect on this state of things. At least half of the vast multitudes of uncivilized peoples, on whom our gigantic manufacturing system, enormous capital, and intense competition force the produce of our looms and workshops, would be not a whit worse off physically, and would certainly be improved morally, if all the articles with which w e supply them were double or treble their present prices. If at the same time the difference of cost, or a large portion of it, could find its way into the pockets of the manufacturing workmen, thousands would be raised from want to comfort, from starvation to health, and would be removed from one of the chief incentives to crime. It is difficult for an Englishman to avoid contemplating with pride our gigantic and ever-increasing manufactures and commerce, and thinking everything good that renders their progress still more rapid, either by lowering the price at which the articles can be produced, or by discovering new markets to which they may be sent. If, however, the question that is so frequently asked of the votaries of the less popular sciences were put here--\"Cui bono?\"--it would be found more difficult to answer than had been imagined. The advantages, even to the few who reap them, would be seen to be mostly physical, while the wide-spread moral and intellectual evils resulting from unceasing labour, low wages, crowded dwellings, and monotonous occupations, to perhaps as large a number as those who gain any real advantage, might be held to show a balance of evil so great, as to lead the greatest admirers of our manufactures and commerce to doubt the advisability of their further development. It will be said: \"We cannot stop it;  capital must be employed; our population must be kept at work; if we hesitate a moment, other nations now hard pressing us will get ahead, and national ruin will follow.\" Some of this is true, some fallacious. It is undoubtedly a difficult problem which we have to solve; and I am inclined to think it is this difficulty that makes men conclude that what seems a necessary and unalterable state of things must be good-that its benefits must he greater than its evils. This was the feeling of the American advocates of slavery; they could not see an easy, comfortable way out of it. In our own case, however, it is to be hoped, that if a fair consideration of the matter in all its hearings shows that a preponderance of evil arises from the immensity of our manufactures and commerce-evil which must go on increasing with their increase-there is enough both of political wisdom and true philanthropy in Englishmen, to induce them to turn their superabundant wealth into other channels. The fact that has led to these remarks is surely a striking one: that in one of the most remote corners of the earth savages can buy clothing cheaper than the people of the country where it is made; that the weaver\\'s child should shiver in the wintry wind, unable to purchase articles attainable by the wild natives of a tropical climate, where clothing is mere ornament or luxury, should make us pause ere we regard with unmixed admiration the system which has led to such a result, and cause us to look with some suspicion on the further extension of that system. It must be remembered too that our commerce is not a purely natural growth. It has been ever fostered by the legislature, and forced to an unnatural luxuriance by the protection of our fleets and armies. The wisdom and the justice of this policy have been already doubted. So soon, therefore, as it is seen that the further extension of our manufactures and commerce would be an evil, the remedy is not far to seek.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After six weeks\\' confinement to the house I was at length well, and could resume my daily walks in the forest. I did not, however, find it so productive as when I had first arrived at Dobbo. There was a damp stagnation about the paths, and insects were very scarce. In some of my best collecting places I now found a mass of rotting wood, mingled with young shoots, and overgrown with climbers, yet I always managed to add something daily to my extensive collections. I one day met with a curious example of failure of instinct, which, by showing it to be fallible, renders it very doubtful whether it is anything more than hereditary habit, dependent on delicate modifications of sensation. Some sailors cut down a good-sized tree, and, as is always my practice, I visited it daily for some time in search of insects. Among other beetles came swarms of the little cylindrical woodborers (Platypus, Tesserocerus, &c.), and commenced making holes in the bark. After a day or two I was surprised to find hundreds of them sticking in the holes they had bored, and on examination discovered that the milky sap of the tree was of the nature of gutta-percha, hardening rapidly on exposure to the air, and glueing the little animals in self-dug graves. The habit of boring holes in trees in which to deposit their eggs, was not accompanied by a sufficient instinctive knowledge of which trees were suitable, and which destructive to them. If, as is very probable, these trees have an attractive odour to certain species of borers, it might very likely lead to their becoming extinct; while other species, to whom the same odour was disagreeable, and who therefore avoided the dangerous trees, would survive, and would be credited by us with an instinct, whereas they would really be guided by a simple sensation.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Those curious little beetles, the Brenthidae, were very abundant in Aru. The females have a pointed rostrum, with which they bore deep holes in the bark of dead trees, often burying the rostrum up to the eyes, and in these holes deposit their eggs. The males are larger, and have the rostrum dilated at the end, and sometimes terminating in a good-sized pair of jaws. I once saw two males fighting together; each had a fore-leg laid across the neck of the other, and the rostrum bent quite in an attitude of defiance, and looking most ridiculous. Another time, two were fighting for a female, who stood close by busy at her boring. They pushed at each other with their rostra, and clawed and thumped, apparently in the greatest rage, although their coats of mail must have saved both from injury. The small one, however, soon ran away, acknowledging himself vanquished. In most Coleoptera the female is larger than the male, and it is therefore interesting, as bearing on the question of sexual selection, that in this case, as in the stag-beetles where the males fight together, they should be not only better armed, but also much larger than the females. Just as we were going away, a handsome tree, allied to Erythrina, was in blossom, showing its masses of large crimson flowers scattered here and there about the forest. Could it have been seen from an elevation, it would have had a fine effect; from below I could only catch sight of masses of gorgeous colour in clusters and festoons overhead, about which flocks of blue and orange lories were fluttering and screaming.\\nMALE BRENTHIDAE (Leptorhynchus angustasus) FIGHTING\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A good many people died at Dobbo this season; I believe about twenty. They were buried in a little grove of Casuarinas behind my house. Among the traders was a. Mahometan priest, who superintended the funerals, which were very simple. The body was wrapped up in new white cotton cloth, and was carried on a bier to the grave. All the spectators sat down on the ground, and the priest chanted some verses from the Koran. The graves were fenced round with a slight bamboo railing, and a little carved wooden head-post was put to mark the spot. There was also in the village a small mosque, where every Friday the faithful went to pray. This is probably more remote from Mecca than any other mosque in the world, and marks the farthest eastern extension of the Mahometan religion. The Chinese here, as elsewhere, showed their superior wealth and civilization by tombstones of solid granite brought from Singapore, with deeply-cut inscriptions, the characters of which are painted in red, blue, and gold. No people have more respect for the graves of their relations and friends than this strange, ubiquitous, money-getting people.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Soon after we had returned to Dobbo, my Macassar boy, Baderoon, took his wages and left me, because I scolded him for laziness. He then occupied himself in gambling, and at first had some luck, and bought ornaments, and had plenty of money. Then his luck turned; he lost everything, borrowed money and lost that, and was obliged to become the slave of his creditor till he had worked out the debt. He was a quick and active lad when he pleased, but was apt to be idle, and had such an incorrigible propensity for gambling, that it will very likely lead to his becoming a slave for life.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The end of June was now approaching, the east monsoon had set in steadily, and in another week or two Dobbo would be deserted. Preparations for departure were everywhere visible, and every sunny day (rather rare now) the streets were as crowded and as busy as beehives. Heaps of tripang were finally dried and packed up in sacks; mother-of-pearl shell, tied up with rattans into convenient bundles, was all day long being carried to the beach to be loaded; water-casks were filled, and cloths and mat-sails mended and strengthened for the run home before the strong east wind. Almost every day groups of natives arrived from the most distant parts of the islands, with cargoes of bananas and sugar- cane to exchange for tobacco, sago, bread, and other luxuries, before the general departure. The Chinamen killed their fat pig and made their parting feast, and kindly sent me some pork, and a basin of birds\\' nest stew, which had very little more taste than a dish of vermicelli. My boy Ali returned from Wanumbai, where I had sent him alone for a fortnight to buy Paradise birds and prepare the skins; he brought me sixteen glorious specimens, and had he not been very ill with fever and ague might have obtained twice the number. He had lived with the people whose house I had occupied, and it is a proof of their goodness, if fairly treated, that although he took with him a quantity of silver dollars to pay for the birds they caught, no attempt was made to rob him, which might have been done with the most perfect impunity. He was kindly treated when ill, and was brought back to me with the balance of the dollars he had not spent.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Wanumbai people, like almost all the inhabitants of the Aru Islands, are perfect savages, and I saw no signs of any religion. There are, however, three or four villages on the coast where schoolmasters from Amboyna reside, and the people are nominally Christians, and are to some extent educated and civilized. I could not get much real knowledge of the customs of the Aru people during the short time I was among them, but they have evidently been considerably influenced by their long association with Mahometan traders. They often bury their dead, although the national custom is to expose the body an a raised stage till it decomposes. Though there is no limit to the number of wives a man may have, they seldom exceed one or two. A wife is regularly purchased from the parents, the price being a large assortment of articles, always including gongs, crockery, and cloth. They told me that some of the tribes kill the old men and women when they can no longer work, but I saw many very old and decrepid people, who seemed pretty well attended to. No doubt all who have much intercourse with the Bugis and Ceramese traders gradually lose many of their native customs, especially as these people often settle in their villages and marry native women.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The trade carried on at Dobbo is very considerable. This year there were fifteen large praus from Macassar, and perhaps a hundred small boats from Ceram, Goram, and Ke. The Macassar cargoes are worth about £1,000. each, and the other boats take away perhaps about £3,000, worth, so that the whole exports may be estimated at £18,000. per annum. The largest and most bulky items are pearl-shell and tripang, or \"beche-de-mer,\" with smaller quantities of tortoise-shell, edible birds\\' nests, pearls, ornamental woods, timber, and Birds of Paradise. These are purchased with a variety of goods. Of arrack, about equal in strength to ordinary West India rum, 3,000 boxes, each containing fifteen half-gallon bottles, are consumed annually. Native cloth from Celebes is much esteemed for its durability, and large quantities are sold, as well as white English calico and American unbleached cottons, common crockery, coarse cutlery, muskets, gunpowder, gongs, small brass cannon, and elephants\\' tusks. These three last articles constitute the wealth of the Aru people, with which they pay for their wives, or which they hoard up as \"real property.\" Tobacco is in immense demand for chewing, and it must be very strong, or an Aru man will not look at it. Knowing how little these people generally work, the mass of produce obtained annually shows that the islands must be pretty thickly inhabited, especially along the coasts, as nine-tenths of the whole are marine productions.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It was on the 2d of July that we left Aru, followed by all the Macassar praus, fifteen in number, who had agreed to sail in company. We passed south of Banda,  and then steered due west, not seeing land for three days, till we sighted some low islands west of Bouton. We had a strong and steady south-east wind day and night, which carried us on at about five knots an hour, where a clipper ship would have made twelve. The sky was continually cloudy, dark, and threatening, with occasional drizzling showers, till we were west of Bouru, when it cleared up and we enjoyed the bright sunny skies of the dry season for the rest of our voyage. It is about here, therefore that the seasons of the eastern and western regions of the Archipelago are divided. West of this line from June to December is generally fine, and often very dry, the rest of the year being the wet season. East of it the weather is exceedingly uncertain, each island, and each side of an island, having its own peculiarities. The difference seems to consist not so much in the distribution of the rainfall as in that of the clouds and the moistness of the atmosphere. In Aru, for example, when we left, the little streams were all dried up, although the weather was gloomy; while in January, February, and March, when we had the hottest sunshine and the finest days, they were always flowing. The driest time of all the year in Aru occurs in September and October, just as it does in Java and Celebes. The rainy seasons agree, therefore, with those of the western islands, although the weather is very different. The Molucca sea is of a very deep blue colour, quite distinct from the clear light blue of the Atlantic. In cloudy and dull weather it looks absolutely black, and when crested with foam has a stern and angry aspect. The wind continued fair and strong during our whole voyage, and we reached Macassar in perfect safety on the evening of the 11th of July, having made the passage from Aru (more than a thousand miles) in nine and a half days.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My expedition to the Aru Islands had been eminently successful. Although I had been for months confined to the house by illness, and had lost much time by the want of the means of locomotion, and by missing the right season at the right place, I brought away with me more than nine thousand specimens of natural objects, of about sixteen hundred distinct species. I had made the acquaintance of a strange and little-known race of men; I had become familiar with the traders of the far East; I had revelled in the delights of exploring a new fauna and flora, one of the most remarkable and most beautiful and least-known in the world; and I had succeeded in the main object for which I had undertaken the journey-namely, to obtain fine specimens of the magnificent Birds of Paradise, and to be enabled to observe them in their native forests. By this success I was stimulated to continue my researches in the Moluccas and New Guinea for nearly five years longer, and it is still the portion of my travels to which I look back with the most complete satisfaction.\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\nTHE ARU ISLANDS - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY AND ASPECTS OF NATURE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0IN this chapter I propose to give a general sketch of the physical geography of the Aru Islands, and of their relation to the surrounding countries; and shall thus be able to incorporate the information obtained from traders, and from the works of other naturalists with my own observations in these exceedingly interesting and little-known regions.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Aru group may be said to consist of one very large central island with a number of small ones scattered round it. The great island is called by the natives and traders \"Tang-busar\" (great or mainland), to distinguish it as a whole from Dobbo, or any of the detached islands. It is of an irregular oblong form, about eighty miles from north to south, and forty or fifty from east to west, in which direction it is traversed by three narrow channels, dividing it into four portions. These channels are always called rivers by the traders, which puzzled me much till I passed through one of them, and saw how exceedingly applicable the name was. The northern channel, called the river of Watelai, is about a quarter of a mile wide at its entrance, but soon narrows to abort the eighth of a mile, which width it retains, with little variation, during its whole, length of nearly fifty miles, till it again widens at its eastern mouth. Its course is moderately winding, and the hanks are generally dry and somewhat elevated. In many places there are low cliffs of hard coralline limestone, more or less worn by the action of water; while sometimes level spaces extend from the banks to low ranges of hills a little inland. A few small streams enter it from right and left, at the mouths of which are some little rocky islands. The depth is very regular, being from ten to fifteen fathoms, and it has thus every feature of a true river, but for the salt water and the absence of a current. The other two rivers, whose names are Vorkai and Maykor, are said to be very similar in general character; but they are rather near together, and have a number of cross channels intersecting the flat tract between them. On the south side of Maykor the banks are very rocky, and from thence to the southern extremity of Aru is an uninterrupted extent of rather elevated and very rocky country, penetrated by numerous small streams, in the high limestone cliffs bordering which the edible birds\\' nests of Aru are chiefly obtained. All my informants stated that the two southern rivers are larger than Watelai.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The whole of Aru is low, but by no means so flat as it has been represented, or as it appears from the sea. Most of it is dry rocky ground, with a somewhat undulating surface, rising here and there into abrupt hillocks, or cut into steep and narrow ravines. Except the patches of swamp which are found at the mouths of most of the small rivers, there is no absolutely level ground, although the greatest elevation is probably not more than two hundred feet. The rock which everywhere appears in the ravines and brooks is a coralline limestone, in some places soft and pliable, in others so hard and crystalline as to resemble our mountain limestone.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The small islands which surround the central mass are very numerous; but most of them are on the east side, where they form a fringe, often extending ten or fifteen miles from the main islands. On the west there are very few, Wamma and Palo Pabi being the chief, with Ougia, and Wassia at the north-west extremity. On the east side the sea is everywhere shallow, and full of coral; and it is here that the pearl-shells are found which form one of the chief staples of Aru trade. All the islands are covered with a dense and very lofty forest.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The physical features here described are of peculiar interest, and, as far as I am aware, are to some extent unique; for I have been unable to find any other record of an island of the size of Aru crossed by channels which exactly resemble true rivers. How these channels originated were a complete puzzle to me, till, after a long consideration of the whole of the natural phenomena presented by these islands, I arrived at a conclusion which I will now endeavour to explain. There are three ways in which we may conceive islands which are not volcanic to have been formed, or to have been reduced to their present condition, by elevation, by subsidence, or by separation from a continent or larger island. The existence of coral rock, or of raised beaches far inland, indicates recent elevation; lagoon coral-islands, and such as have barrier or encircling reefs, have suffered subsidence; while our own islands, whose productions are entirely those of the adjacent continent, have been separated from it. Now the Aru Islands are all coral rock, and the adjacent sea is shallow and full of coral, it is therefore evident that they have been elevated from beneath the ocean at a not very distant epoch. But if we suppose that elevation to be the first and only cause of their present condition, we shall find ourselves quite unable to explain the curious river-channels which divide them. Fissures during upheaval would not produce the regular width, the regular depth, or the winding curves which characterise them; and the action of tides and currents during their elevation might form straits of irregular width and depth, but not the river-like channels which actually exist. If, again, we suppose the last movement to have been one of subsidence, reducing the size of the islands, these channels are quite as inexplicable; for subsidence would necessarily lead to the flooding of all low tracts on the banks of the old rivers, and thus obliterate their courses; whereas these remain perfect, and of nearly uniform width from end to end.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Now if these channels have ever been rivers they must have flowed from some higher regions, and this must have been to the east, because on the north and west the sea-bottom sinks down at a short distance from the shore to an unfathomable depth; whereas on the east. a shallow sea, nowhere exceeding fifty fathoms, extends quite across to New Guinea, a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles. An elevation of only three hundred feet would convert the whole of this sea into moderately high land, and make the Aru Islands a portion of New Guinea; and the rivers which have their mouths at Utanata and Wamuka, might then have flowed on across Aru, in the channels which are now occupied by salt water. Then the intervening land sunk down, we must suppose the land that now constitutes Aru to have remained nearly stationary, a not very improbable supposition, when we consider the great extent of the shallow sea, and the very small amount of depression the land need have undergone to produce it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0But the fact of the Aru Islands having once been connected with New Guinea does not rest on this evidence alone. There is such a striking resemblance between the productions of the two countries as only- exists between portions of a common territory. I collected one hundred species of land-birds in the Aru Islands, and about eighty of them, have been found on the mainland of New Guinea. Among these are the great wingless cassowary, two species of heavy brush turkeys, and two of short winged thrushes; which could certainly not have passed over the 150 miles of open sea to the coast of New Guinea. This barrier is equally effectual in the case of many other birds which live only in the depths of the forest, as the kinghunters (Dacelo gaudichaudi), the fly-catching wrens (Todopsis), the great crown pigeon (Goura coronata), and the small wood doves (Ptilonopus perlatus, P. aurantiifrons, and P. coronulatus). Now, to show the real effect of such barrier, let us take the island of Ceram, which is exactly the same distance from New Guinea, but separated from it by a deep sea. Cut of about seventy land-birds inhabiting Ceram, only fifteen are found in New Guinea, and none of these are terrestrial or forest-haunting species. The cassowary is distinct; the kingfishers, parrots, pigeons, flycatchers, honeysuckers, thrushes, and cuckoos, are almost always quite distinct species. More than this, at least twenty genera, which are common to New Guinea and Aru, do not extend into Ceram, indicating with a force which every naturalist will appreciate, that the two latter countries have received their faunas in a radically different manner. Again, a true kangaroo is found in Aru, and the same species occurs in Mysol, which is equally Papuan in its productions, while either the same, or one closely allied to it, inhabits New Guinea; but no such animal is found in Ceram, which is only sixty miles from Mysol. Another small marsupial animal (Perameles doreyanus) is common to Aru and New Guinea. The insects show exactly the same results. The butterflies of Aru are all either New Guinea species, or very slightly modified forms; whereas those of Ceram are more distinct than are the birds of the two countries.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is now generally admitted that we may safely reason on such facts as those, which supply a link in the defective geological record. The upward and downward movements which any country has undergone, and the succession of such movements, can be determined with much accuracy; but geology alone can tell us nothing of lands which have entirely disappeared beneath the ocean. Here physical geography and the distribution of animals and plants are of the greatest service. By ascertaining the depth of the seas separating one country from another, we can form some judgment of the changes which are taking place. If there are other evidences of subsidence, a shallow sea  implies a former connexion of the adjacent lands; but i£ this evidence is wanting, or if there is reason to suspect a rising of the land, then the shallow sea may be the result of that rising, and may indicate that the two countries will be joined at some future time, but not that they have previously been so. The nature of the animals and plants inhabiting these countries will, however, almost always enable us to determine this question. Mr. Darwin has shown us how we may determine in almost every case, whether an island has ever been connected with a continent or larger land, by the presence or absence of terrestrial Mammalia and reptiles. What he terms \"oceanic islands \"possess neither of these groups of animals, though they may have a luxuriant vegetation, and a fair number of birds, insects, and landshells; and we therefore conclude that they have originated in mid-ocean, and have never been connected with the nearest masses of land. St. Helena, Madeira, and New Zealand are examples of oceanic islands. They possess all other classes of life, because these have means of dispersion over wide spaces of sea, which terrestrial mammals and birds have not, as is fully explained in Sir Charles Lyell\\'s \"Principles of Geology,\" and Mr. Darwin\\'s \"Origin of Species.\" On the other hand, an island may never have been actually connected with the adjacent continents or islands, and yet may possess representatives of all classes of animals, because many terrestrial mammals and some reptiles have the means of passing over short distances of sea. But in these cases the number of species that have thus migrated will be very small, and there will be great deficiencies even in birds and flying insects, which we should imagine could easily cross over. The island of Timor (as I have already shown in Chapter XIII) bears this relation to Australia; for while it contains several birds and insects of Australian forms, no Australian mammal or reptile is found in it, and a great number of the most abundant and characteristic forms of Australian birds and insects are entirely absent. Contrast this with the British Islands, in, which a large proportion of the plants, insects, reptiles, and Mammalia of the adjacent parts of the continent are fully represented, while there are no remarkable deficiencies of extensive groups, such as always occur when there is reason to believe there has been no such connexion. The case of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java, and the Asiatic continent is equally clear; many large Mammalia, terrestrial birds, and reptiles being common to all, while a large number more are of closely allied forms. Now, geology has taught us that this representation by allied forms in the same locality implies lapse of time, and we therefore infer that in Great Britain, where almost every species is absolutely identical with those on the Continent, the separation has been very recent; while in Sumatra and Java, where a considerable number of the continental species are represented by allied forms, the separation was more remote.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0From these examples we may see how important a supplement to geological evidence is the study of the geographical distribution of animals and plants, in determining the former condition of the earth\\'s surface; and how impossible it is to understand the former without taking the latter into account. The productions of the Aru Islands offer the strangest evidence, that at no very distant epoch they formed a part of New Guinea; and the peculiar physical features which I have described, indicate that they must have stood at very nearly the same level then as they do now, having been separated by the subsidence of the great plain which formerly connected them with it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Persons who have formed the usual ideas of the vegetation of the tropics who picture to themselves the abundance and brilliancy of the flowers, and the magnificent appearance of hundreds of forest trees covered with masses of coloured blossoms, will be surprised to hear, that though vegetation in Aru is highly luxuriant and varied, and would afford abundance of fine and curious plants to adorn our hothouses, yet bright and showy flowers are, as a general rule, altogether absent, or so very scarce as to produce no effect whatever on the general scenery. To give particulars: I have visited five distinct localities in the islands, I have wandered daily in the forests, and have passed along upwards of a hundred miles of coast and river during a period of six months, much of it very fine weather, and till just as I was about to leave, I never saw a single plant of striking brilliancy or beauty, hardly a shrub equal to a hawthorn, or a climber equal to a honeysuckle! It cannot be said that the flowering season had not arrived, for I saw many herbs, shrubs, and forest trees in flower, but all had blossoms of a green or greenish-white tint, not superior to our lime-trees. Here and there on the river banks and coasts are a few Convolvulaceae, not equal to our garden Ipomaeas, and in the deepest shades of the forest some fine scarlet and purple Zingiberaceae, but so few and scattered as to be nothing amid the mass of green and flowerless vegetation. Yet the noble Cycadaceae and screw-pines, thirty or forty feet high, the elegant tree ferns, the lofty palms, and the variety of beautiful and curious plants which everywhere meet the eye, attest the warmth and moisture of the tropics, and the fertility of the soil.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is true that Aru seemed to me exceptionally poor in flowers, but this is only an exaggeration of a general tropical feature; for my whole experience in the equatorial regions of the west and the east has convinced me, that in the most luxuriant parts of the tropics, flowers are less abundant, on the average less showy, and are far less effective in adding colour to the landscape than in temperate climates. I have never seen in the tropics such brilliant masses of colour as even England can show in her furze-clad commons, her heathery mountain-sides, her glades of wild hyacinths, her fields of poppies, her meadows of buttercups and orchises--carpets of yellow, purple, azure-blue, and fiery crimson, which the tropics can rarely exhibit. We, have smaller masses of colour in our hawthorn and crab trees, our holly and mountain-ash, our boom; foxgloves, primroses, and purple vetches, which clothe with gay colours the whole length and breadth of our land, These beauties are all common. They are characteristic of the country and the climate; they have not to be sought for, but they gladden the eye at every step. In the regions of the equator, on the other hand, whether it be forest or savannah, a sombre green clothes universal nature. You may journey for hours, and even for days, and meet with nothing to break the monotony. Flowers are everywhere rare, and anything at all striking is only to be met with at very distant intervals.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The idea that nature exhibits gay colours in the tropics, and that the general aspect of nature is there more bright and varied in hue than with us, has even been made the foundation of theories of art, and we have been forbidden to use bright colours in our garments, and in the decorations of our dwellings, because it was supposed that we should be thereby acting in opposition to the teachings of nature. The argument itself is a very poor one, since it might with equal justice be maintained, that as we possess faculties for the appreciation of colours, we should make up for the deficiencies of nature and use the gayest tints in those regions where the landscape is most monotonous. But the assumption on which the argument is founded is totally false, so that even if the reasoning were valid, we need not be afraid of outraging nature, by decorating our houses and our persons with all those gay hues which are so lavishly spread over our fields and mountains, our hedges, woods, and meadows.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is very easy to see what has led to this erroneous view of the nature of tropical vegetation. In our hothouses and at our flower-shows we gather together the finest flowering plants from the most distant regions of the earth, and exhibit them in a proximity to each other which never occurs in nature. A hundred distinct plants, all with bright, or strange, or gorgeous flowers, make a wonderful show when brought together; but perhaps no two of these plants could ever be seen together in a state of nature, each inhabiting a distant region or a different station. Again, all moderately warm extra-European countries are mixed up with the tropics in general estimation, and a vague idea is formed that whatever is preeminently beautiful must come from the hottest parts of the earth. But the fact is quite the contrary. Rhododendrons and azaleas are plants of temperate regions, the grandest lilies are from temperate Japan, and a large proportion of our most showy flowering plants are natives of the Himalayas, of the Cape, of the United States, of Chili, or of China and Japan, all temperate regions. True, there are a great number of grand and gorgeous flowers in the tropics, but the proportion they bear to the mass of the vegetation is exceedingly small; so that what appears an anomaly is nevertheless a fact, and the effect of flowers on the general aspect of nature is far less in the equatorial than in the temperate regions of the earth.\\nNEW GUINEA - DOREY\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(MARCH TO JULY 1858)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0AFTER my return from Gilolo to Ternate, in March 1858, I made arrangements for my long-wished-for voyage to the mainland of New Guinea, where I anticipated that my collections would surpass those which I had formed at the Aru Islands. The poverty of Ternate in articles used by Europeans was shown, by my searching in vain through all the stores for such common things as flour, metal spoons, wide-mouthed phials, beeswax, a penknife, and a stone or metal pestle and mortar. I took with me four servants: my head man Ali, and a Ternate lad named Jumaat (Friday), to shoot; Lahagi, a steady middle-aged man, to cut timber and assist me in insect-collecting; and Loisa, a Javanese cook. As I knew I should have to build a house at Dorey, where I was going, I took with me eighty cadjans, or waterproof mats, made of pandanus leaves, to cover over my baggage on first landing, and to help to roof my house afterwards.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We started on the 25th of March in the schooner Hester Helena, belonging to my friend Mr. Duivenboden, and bound on a trading voyage along the north coast of New Guinea. Having calms and light airs, we were three days reaching Gane, near the south end of Gilolo, where we stayed to fill. up our water-casks and buy a few provisions. We obtained fowls, eggs, sago, plantains, sweet potatoes, yellow pumpkins, chilies, fish, and dried deer\\'s meat; and on the afternoon of the 29th proceeded on our voyage to Dorey harbour. We found it, however, by no means easy to get along; for so near to the equator the monsoons entirely fail of their regularity, and after passing the southern point of Gilolo we had calms, light puffs of wind, and contrary currents, which kept us for five days in sight of the same islands between it and Poppa. A squall them brought us on to the entrance of Dampier\\'s Straits, where we were again becalmed, and were three more days creeping through them. Several native canoes now came off to us from Waigiou on one side, and Batanta on the other, bringing a few common shells, palm-leaf mats, cocoa-nuts, and pumpkins. They were very extravagant in their demands, being accustomed to sell their trifles to whalers and China ships, whose crews will purchase anything at ten times its value. My only purchases were a float belonging to a turtle-spear, carved to resemble a bird, and a very well made palm-leaf box, for which articles I gave a copper ring and a yard of calico. The canoes were very narrow and furnished with an outrigger, and in some of them there was only one man, who seemed to think nothing of coming out alone eight or ten miles from shore. The people were Papuans, much resembling the natives of Aru.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When we had got out of the Straits, and were fairly in the great Pacific Ocean, we had a steady wind for the first time since leaving Ternate, but unfortunately it was dead ahead, and we had to beat against it, tacking on and off the coast of New Guinea. I looked with intense interest on those rugged mountains, retreating ridge behind ridge into the interior, where the foot of civilized man had never trod. There was the country of the cassowary and the tree-kangaroo, and those dark forests produced the most extraordinary and the most beautiful of the feathered inhabitants of the earth--the varied species of Birds of Paradise. A few days more and I hoped to be in pursuit of these, and of the scarcely less beautiful insects which accompany them. We had still, however, for several days only calms and light head-winds, and it was not till the l0th of April that a fine westerly breeze set in, followed by a squally night, which kept us off the entrance of Dorey harbour. The next morning we entered, and came to anchor off the small island of Mansinam, on which dwelt two German missionaries, Messrs. Otto and Geisler. The former immediately came on board to give us welcome, and invited us to go on shore and breakfast with him. We were then introduced to his companion who was suffering dreadfully from an abscess on the heel, which had confined him to the house for six months--and to his wife, a young German woman, who had been out only three months. Unfortunately she could speak no Malay or English, and had to guess at our compliments on her excellent breakfast by the justice we did to it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0These missionaries were working men, and had been sent out, as being more useful among savages than persons of a higher class. They had been here about two years, and Mr. Otto had already learnt to speak the Papuan language with fluency, and had begun translating some portions of the Bible. The language, however, is so poor that a considerable number of Malay words have to be used; and it is very questionable whether it is possible to convey any idea of such a book, to a people in so low a state of civilization. The only nominal converts yet made are a few of the women; and some few of the children attend school, and are being taught to read, but they make little progress. There is one feature of this mission which I believe will materially interfere with its moral effect. The missionaries are allowed to trade to eke out the very small salaries granted them from Europe, and of course are obliged to carry out the trade principle of buying cheap and selling dear, in order to make a profit. Like all savages the natives are quite careless of the future, and when their small rice crops are gathered they bring a large portion of it to the missionaries, and sell it for knives, beads, axes, tobacco, or any other articles they may require. A few months later, in the wet season, when food is scarce, they come to buy it back again, and give in exchange tortoiseshell, tripang, wild nutmegs, or other produce. Of course the rice is sold at a much higher rate than it was bought, as is perfectly fair and just -- and the operation is on the whole thoroughly beneficial to the natives, who would otherwise consume and waste their food when it was abundant, and then starve -- yet I cannot imagine that the natives see it in this light. They must look upon the trading missionaries with some suspicion, and cannot feel so sure of their teachings being disinterested, as would be the case if they acted like the Jesuits in Singapore. The first thing to be done by the missionary in attempting to improve savages, is to convince them by his actions that he comes among them for their benefit only, and not for any private ends of his own. To do this he must act in a different way from other men, not trading and taking advantage of the necessities of those who want to sell, but rather giving to those who are in distress. It would he well if he conformed himself in some degree to native customs, and then endeavoured to show how these customs might be gradually modified, so as to be more healthful and more agreeable. A few energetic and devoted men acting in this way might probably effect a decided moral improvement on the lowest savage tribes, whereas trading missionaries, teaching what Jesus said, but not doing as He did, can scarcely be expected to do more than give them a very little of the superficial varnish of religion.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dorey harbour is in a fine bay, at one extremity of which an elevated point juts out, and, with two or three small islands, forms a sheltered anchorage. The only vessel it contained when we arrived was a Dutch brig, laden with coals for the use of a war- steamer, which was expected daily, on an exploring expedition along the coasts of New Guinea, for the purpose of fixing on a locality for a colony. In the evening we paid it a visit, and landed at the village of Dorey, to look out for a place where I could build my house. Mr. Otto also made arrangements for me with some of the native chiefs, to send men to cut wood, rattans, and bamboo the next day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The villages of Mansinam and Dorey presented some features quite new to me. The houses all stand completely in the water, and are reached by long rude bridges. They are very low, with the roof shaped like a large boat, bottom upwards. The posts which support the houses, bridges, and platforms are small crooked sticks, placed without any regularity, and looking as if they were tumbling down. The floors are also formed of sticks, equally irregular, and so loose and far apart that I found it almost impossible to walls on them. The walls consist of bits of boards, old boats, rotten mats, attaps, and palm-leaves, stuck in anyhow here and there, and having altogether the most wretched and dilapidated appearance it is possible to conceive. Under the eaves of many of the houses hang human skulls, the trophies of their battles with the savage Arfaks of the interior, who often come to attack them. A large boat-shaped council-house is supported on larger posts, each of which is grossly carved to represent a naked male or female human figure, and other carvings still more revolting are placed upon the platform before the entrance. The view of an ancient lake-dweller\\'s village, given as the frontispiece of Sir Charles Lyell\\'s \"Antiquity of Man,\" is chiefly founded on a sketch of this very village of Dorey; but the extreme regularity of the structures there depicted has no place in the original, any more than it probably had in the actual lake-villages.\\nPAPUAN, NEW GUINEA\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The people who inhabit these miserable huts are very similar to the Ké and Aru islanders, and many of them are very handsome, being tall and well-made, with well-cut features and large aquiline noses. Their colour is a deep brown, often approaching closely to black, and the fine mop-like heads of frizzly hair appear to be more common than elsewhere, and are considered a great ornament, a long six-pronged bamboo fork being kept stuck in them to serve the purpose of a comb; and this is assiduously used at idle moments to keep the densely growing mass from becoming matted and tangled. The majority have short woolly hair, which does not seem capable of an equally luxuriant development. A growth of hair somewhat similar to this, and almost as abundant, is found among the half-breeds between the Indian and Negro in South America. Can this be an indication that the Papuans are a mixed race?\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0For the first three days after our arrival I was fully occupied from morning to night building a house, with the assistance of a dozen Papuans and my own men. It was immense trouble to get our labourers to work, as scarcely one of them could speak a word of Malay; and it was only by the most energetic gesticulations, and going through a regular pantomime of what was wanted, that we could get them to do anything. If we made them understand that a few more poles were required, which two could have easily cut, six or eight would insist upon going together, although we needed their assistance in other things. One morning ten of them came to work, bringing only one chopper between them, although they knew I had none ready for use.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I chose a place about two hundred yards from the beach, on an elevated ground, by the side of the chief path from the village of Dorey to the provision-grounds and the forest. Within twenty yards was a little stream; which furnished us with excellent water and a nice place to bathe. There was only low underwood to clear away, while some fine forest trees stood at a short distance, and we cut down the wood for about twenty yards round to give us light and air. The house, about twenty feet by fifteen; was built entirely of wood, with a bamboo floor, a single door of thatch, and a large window, looking over the sea, at which I fixed my table, and close beside it my bed, within a little partition. I bought a number of very large palm-leaf mats of the natives, which made excellent walls; while the mats I had brought myself were used on the roof, and were covered over with attaps as soon as we could get them made. Outside, and rather behind, was a little hut, used for cooking, and a bench, roofed over, where my men could sit to skin birds and animals. When all was finished, I had my goods and stores brought up, arranged them conveniently inside, and then paid my Papuans with knives and choppers, and sent them away. The next day our schooner left for the more eastern islands, and I found myself fairly established as the only European inhabitant of the vast island of New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As we had some doubt about the natives, we slept at first with loaded guns beside us and a watch set; but after a few days, finding the people friendly, and feeling sure that they would not venture to attack five well-armed men, we took no further precautions. We had still a day or two\\'s work in finishing up the house, stopping leaks, putting up our hanging shelves for drying specimens inside and out, and making the path down to the water, and a clear dry space in front of the horse.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 17th, the steamer not having arrived, the coal-ship left, having lain here a month, according to her contract; and on the same day my hunters went out to shoot for the first time, and brought home a magnificent crown pigeon and a few common birds. The next day they were more successful, and I was delighted to see them return with a Bird of Paradise in full plumage, a pair of the fine Papuan lories (Lorius domicella), four other lories and parroquets, a grackle (Gracula dumonti), a king-hunter (Dacelo gaudichaudi), a racquet-tailed kingfisher (Tanysiptera galatea), and two or three other birds of less beauty.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I went myself to visit the native village on the hill behind Dorey, and took with me a small present of cloth, knives, and beads, to secure the good-will of the chief, and get him to send some men to catch or shoot birds for me. The houses were scattered about among rudely cultivated clearings. Two which I visited consisted of a central passage, on each side of which opened short passages, admitting to two rooms, each of which was a house accommodating a separate family. They were elevated at least fifteen feet above the ground, on a complete forest of poles, and were so rude and dilapidated that some of the small passages had openings in the floor of loose sticks, through which a child might fall. The inhabitants seemed rather uglier than those at Dorey village. They are, no doubt, the true indigenes of this part of New Guinea, living in the interior, and subsisting by cultivation and hunting. The Dorey men, on the other hand, are shore-dwellers, fishers and traders in a small way, and have thus the character of a colony who have migrated from another district. These hillmen or \"Arfaks \"differed much in physical features. They were generally black, but some were brown like Malays. Their hair, though always more or less frizzly, was sometimes short and matted, instead of being long, loose, and woolly; and this seemed to be a constitutional difference, not the effect of care and cultivation. Nearly half of them were afflicted with the scurfy skin-disease. The old chief seemed much pleased with his present, and promised (through an interpreter I brought with me) to protect my men when they came there shooting, and also to procure me some birds and animals. While conversing, they smoked tobacco of their own growing, in pipes cut from a single piece of wood with a long upright handle.\\nPAPUAN PIPE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We had arrived at Dorey about the end of the wet season, when the whole country was soaked with moisture The native paths were so neglected as to be often mere tunnels closed over with vegetation, and in such places there was always a fearful accumulation of mud. To the naked Papuan this is no obstruction. He wades through it, and the next watercourse makes him clean again; but to myself, wearing boots and trousers, it was a most disagreeable thing to have to go up to my knees in a mud-hole every morning. The man I brought with me to cut wood fell ill soon after we arrived, or I would have set him to clear fresh paths in the worst places. For the first ten days it generally rained every afternoon and all night r but by going out every hour of fine weather, I managed to get on tolerably with my collections of birds and insects, finding most of those collected by Lesson during his visit in the Coquille, as well as many new ones. It appears, however, that Dorey is not the place for Birds of Paradise, none of the natives being accustomed to preserve them. Those sold here are all brought from Amberbaki, about a hundred miles west, where the Doreyans go to trade.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The islands in the bay, with the low lands near the coast, seem to have been formed by recently raised coral reef\\'s, and are much strewn with masses of coral but little altered. The ridge behind my house, which runs out to the point, is also entirely coral rock, although there are signs of a stratified foundation in the ravines, and the rock itself is more compact and crystalline. It is therefore, probably older, a more recent elevation having exposed the low grounds and islands. On the other side of the bay rise the great mass of the Arfak mountains, said by the French navigators to be about ten thousand feet high, and inhabited by savage tribes. These are held in great dread by the Dorey people, who have often been attacked and plundered by them, and have some of their skulls hanging outside their houses. If I was seem going into the forest anywhere in the direction of the mountains, the little boys of the village would shout after me, \"Arfaki! Arfaki?\" just as they did after Lesson nearly forty years before.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 15th of May the Dutch war-steamer Etna arrived; but, as the coals had gone, it was obliged to stay till they came back. The captain knew when the coalship was to arrive, and how long it was chartered to stay at Dorey, and could have been back in time, but supposed it would wait for him, and so did not hurry himself. The steamer lay at anchor just opposite my house, and I had the advantage of hearing the half-hourly bells struck, which was very pleasant after the monotonous silence of the forest. The captain, doctor, engineer, and some other of the officers paid me visits; the servants came to the brook to wash clothes, and the son of the Prince of Tidore, with one or two companions, to bathe; otherwise I saw little of them, and was not disturbed by visitors so much as I had expected to be. About this time the weather set in pretty fine, but neither birds nor insects became much more abundant, and new birds -were very scarce. None of the Birds of Paradise except the common one were ever met with, and we were still searching in vain for several of the fine birds which Lesson had obtained here. Insects were tolerably abundant, but were not on the average so fine as those of Amboyna, and I reluctantly came to the conclusion that Dorey was not a good collecting locality. Butterflies were very scarce, arid were mostly the same as those which I had obtained at Aru.\\nHORNED FLIES\\nElaphomia cervicornis - - - - - - Elaphomia wallecia\\nE. brevicornis \\xa0- - - - - - - - - - E. alcicornis\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Among the insects of other orders, the most curious and novel were a group of horned flies, of which I obtained four distinct species, settling on fallen trees and decaying trunks. These remarkable insects, which have been described by Mr. W. W. Saunders as a new genus, under the name of Elaphomia or deer- flies, are about half an inch long, slender-bodied, and with very long legs, which they draw together so as to elevate their bodies high above the surface they are standing upon. The front pair of legs are much shorter, and these are often stretched directly forwards, so as to resemble antenna. The horns spring from beneath the eye, and seem to be a prolongation of the lower part of the orbit. In the largest and most singular species, named Elaphomia cervicornis or the stag-horned deer-fly, these horns are nearly as long as the body, having two branches, with two small snags near their bifurcation, so as to resemble the horns of a stag. They are black, with the tips pale, while the body and legs are yellowish brown, and the eyes (when alive) violet and green. The next species (Elaphomia wallacei) is of a dark brown colour, banded and spotted with yellow. The horns are about one- third the length of the insect, broad, flat, and of an elongated triangular foam. They are of a beautiful pink colour, edged with black, and with a pale central stripe. The front part of the head is also pink, and the eyes violet pink, with a green stripe across them, giving the insect a very elegant and singular appearance. The third species (Elaphomia alcicornis, the elk- horned deer-fly) is a little smaller than the two already described, but resembling in colour Elaphomia wallacei. The horns are very remarkable, being suddenly dilated into a flat plate, strongly toothed round the outer margin, and strikingly resembling the horns of the elk, after which it has been named. They are of a yellowish colour, margined with brown, and tipped with black on the three upper teeth. The fourth species (Elaphomia brevicornis, the short-horned deer-fly) differs considerably from the rest. It is stouter in form, of a nearly black colour, with a yellow ring at the base of the abdomen; the wings have dusky stripes, and the head is compressed and dilated laterally, with very small flat horns; which are black with a pale centre, and look exactly like the rudiment of the horns of the two preceding species. None of the females have any trace of the horns, ane Mr. Saunders places in the same genus a species which has no horns in either sex (Elaphomia polita). It is of a shining black colour, and resembles Elaphomia cervicornis in form, size, and general appearance. The figures above given represent these insects of their natural size and in characteristic attitudes.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The natives seldom brought me anything. They are poor creatures, and, rarely shoot a bird, pig, or kangaroo, or even the sluggish opossum-like Cuscus. The tree-kangaroos are found here, but must be very scarce, as my hunters, although out daily in the forest, never once saw them. Cockatoos, lories, and parroquets were really the only common birds. Even pigeons were scarce, and in little variety, although we occasionally got the fine crown pigeon, which was always welcome as an addition to our scantily furnished larder.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Just before the steamer arrived I had wounded my ankle by clambering among the trunks and branches of fallen trees (which formed my best hunting grounds for insects), and, as usual with foot wounds in this climate, it turned into an obstinate ulcer, keeping me in the house for several days. When it healed up it was followed by an internal inflammation of the foot, which by the doctor\\'s advice I poulticed incessantly for four or five days, bringing out a severe inflamed swelling on the tendon above the heel. This had to be leeched, and lanced, and doctored with ointments and poultices for several weeks, till I was almost driven to despair,--for the weather was at length fine, and I was tantalized by seeing grand butterflies flying past my door, and thinking of the twenty or thirty new species of insects that I ought to be getting every day. And this, too, in New Guinea--a country which I might never visit again,--a country which no naturalist had ever resided in before,--a country which contained more strange and new and beautiful natural objects than any other part of the globe. The naturalist will be able to appreciate my feelings, sitting from morning to night in my little hut, unable to move without a crutch, and my only solace the birds my hunters brought in every afternoon, and the few insects caught by my Ternate man, Lahagi, who now went out daily in my place, but who of course did not get a fourth part of what I should have obtained. To add to my troubles all my men were more or less ill, some with fever, others with dysentery or ague; at one time there were three of them besides myself all helpless, the coon alone being well, and having enough to do to wait upon us. The Prince of Tidore and the Resident of Panda were both on board the steamer, and were seeking Birds of Paradise, sending men round in every direction, so that there was no chance of my getting even native skins of the rarer kinds; and any birds, insects, or animals the Dorey people had to sell were taken on board the steamer, where purchasers were found for everything, and where a larger variety of articles were offered in exchange than I had to show.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After a month\\'s close confinement in the house I was at length able to go out a little, and about the same time I succeeded in getting a boat and six natives to take Ali and Lahagi to Amberbaki, and to bring them back at the end of a month. Ali was charged to buy all the Birds of Paradise he could get, and to shoot and skin all other rare or new birds; and Lahagi was to collect insects, which I hoped might be more abundant than at Dorey. When I recommenced my daily walks in search of insects, I found a great change in the neighbourhood, and one very agreeable to me. All the time I had been laid up the ship\\'s crew and the Javanese soldiers who had been brought in a tender (a sailing ship which had arrived soon after the Etna), had been employed cutting down, sawing, and splitting large trees for firewood, to enable the steamer to get back to Amboyna if the coal-ship did not return; and they had also cleared a number of wide, straight paths through the forest in various directions, greatly to the astonishment of the natives, who could not make out what it all meant. I had now a variety of walks, and a good deal of dead wood on which to search for insects; but notwithstanding these advantages, they were not nearly so plentiful as I had found them at Sarawak, or Amboyna, or Batchian, confirming my opinion that Dorey was not a good locality. It is quite probable, however, that at a station a few miles in the interior, away from the recently elevated coralline rocks and the influence of the sea air, a much more abundant harvest might be obtained.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0One afternoon I went on board the steamer to return the captain\\'s visit, and was shown some very nice sketches (by one of the lieutenants), made on the south coast, and also at the Arfak mountain, to which they had made an excursion. From these and the captain\\'s description, it appeared that the people of Arfak were similar to those of Dorey, and I could hear nothing of the straight-haired race which Lesson says inhabits the interior, but which no one has ever seen, and the account of which I suspect has originated in some mistake. The captain told me he had made a detailed survey of part of the south coast, and if the coal arrived should go away at once to Humboldt Pay, in longitude 141° east, which is the line up to which the Dutch claim New Guinea. On board the tender I found a brother naturalist, a German named Rosenberg, who was draughtsman to the surveying staff. He had brought two men with him to shoot and skin birds, and had been able to purchase a few rare skins from the natives. Among these was a pair of the superb Paradise Pie (Astrapia nigra) in tolerable preservation. They were brought from the island of Jobie, which may be its native country, as it certainly is of the rarer species of crown pigeon (Goura steursii), one of which was brought alive and sold on board. Jobie, however, is a very dangerous place, and sailors are often murdered there when on shore; sometimes the vessels themselves being attacked. Wandammen, on the mainland opposite Jobie, inhere there are said to be plenty of birds, is even worse, and at either of these places my life would not have been worth a week\\'s purchase had I ventured to live alone and unprotected as at Dorey. On board the steamer they had a pair of tree kangaroos alive. They differ chiefly from the ground-kangaroo in having a more hairy tail, not thickened at the base, and not used as a prop; and by the powerful claws on the fore-feet, by which they grasp the bark and branches, and seize the leaves on which they feed. They move along by short jumps on their hind-feet, which do not seem particularly well adapted for climbing trees. It has been supposed that these tree-kangaroos are a special adaptation to the swampy, half-drowned forests of, New Guinea, in place of the usual form of the group, which is adapted only to dry ground. Mr. Windsor Earl makes much of this theory, but, unfortunately for it, the tree-kangaroos are chiefly found in the northern peninsula of New Guinea, which is entirely composed of hills and mountains with very little flat land, while the kangaroo of the low flat Aru Islands (Dorcopsis asiaticus) is a ground species. A more probable supposition seems to lie, that the tree-kangaroo has been modified to enable it to feed on foliage in the vast forests of New Guinea, as these form the great natural feature which distinguishes that country from Australia.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On June 5th, the coal-ship arrived, having been sent back from Amboyna, with the addition of some fresh stores for the steamer. The wood, which had been almost all taken on board, was now unladen again, the coal taken in, and on the 17th both steamer and tender left for Humboldt Bay. We were then a little quiet again, and got something to eat; for while the vessels were here every bit of fish or vegetable was taken on board, and I had often to make a small parroquet serve for two meals. My men now returned from Amberbaki, but, alas brought me almost nothing. They had visited several villages, and even went two days\\' journey into the interior, but could find no skins of Birds of Paradise to purchase, except the common kind, and very few even of those. The birds found were the same as at Dorey, but were still scarcer. None of the natives anywhere near the coast shoot or prepare Birds of Paradise, which come from far in the interior over two or three ranges of mountains, passing by barter from village to village till they reach the sea. There the natives of Dorey buy them, and on their return home sell them .to the Bugis or Ternate traders. It is therefore hopeless for a traveller to go to any particular place on the coast of New Guinea where rare Paradise birds may have been bought, in hopes of obtaining freshly killed specimens from the natives; and it also shows the scarcity of these birds in any one locality, since from the Amberbaki district, a celebrated place, where at least five or six species have been procured, not one of the rarer ones has been obtained this year. The Prince of Tidore, who would certainly have got them if any were to be had, was obliged to put up with a few of the common yellow ones. I think it probable that a longer residence at Dorey, a little farther in the interior, might show that several of the rarer kinds were found there, as I obtained a single female of the fine scale-breasted Ptiloris magnificus. I was told at Ternate of a bird that is certainly not yet known in Europe, a black King Paradise Bird, with the curled tail and beautiful side plumes of the common species, but all the rest of the plumage glossy black. The people of Dorey knew nothing about this, although they recognised by description most of the otter species.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When the steamer left, I was suffering from a severe attack of fever. In about a week I got over this, but it was followed by such a soreness of the whole inside of the mouth, tongue, and gums, that for many days I could put nothing solid between my lips, but was obliged to subsist entirely on slops, although in other respects very well. At the same time two of my men again fell ill, one with fever, the other with dysentery, and both got very bad. I did what I could for them with my small stock of medicines, but they lingered on for some weeks, till on June 26th poor Jumaat died. He was about eighteen years of age, a native, I believe, of Bouton, and a quiet lad, not very active, but doing his work pretty steadily, and as well as he was able. As my men were all Mahometans, I let them bury him in their own fashion, giving them some new cotton cloth for a shroud.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On July 6th the steamer returned from the eastward. The weather was still terribly wet, when, according to rule, it should have been fine and dry. We had scarcely anything to eat, and were all of us ill. Fevers, colds, and dysentery were continually attacking us, and made me long I-o get away from New Guinea, as much as ever I had longed to come there. The captain of the Etna paid me a visit, and gave me a very interesting account of his trip. They had stayed at Humboldt Bay several days, and found it a much more beautiful and more interesting place than Dorey, as well as a better harbour. The natives were quite unsophisticated, being rarely visited except by stray whalers, and they were superior to the Dorey people, morally and physically. They went quite naked. Their houses were some in the water and some inland, and were all neatly and well built; their fields were well cultivated, and the paths to them kept clear and open, in which respects Dorey is abominable. They were shy at first, and opposed the boats with hostile demonstrations, beading their bows, and intimating that they would shoot if an attempt was made to land. Very judiciously the captain gave way, but threw on shore a few presents, and after two or three trials they were permitted to land, and to go about and see the country, and were supplied with fruits and vegetables. All communication was carried on with them by signs--the Dorey interpreter, who accompanied the steamer, being unable to understand a word of their language. No new birds or animals were obtained, but in their ornaments the feathers of Paradise birds were seen, showing, as might be expected, that these birds range far in this direction, and probably all over New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is curious that a rudimental love of art should co-exist with such a very low state of civilization. The people of Dorey are great carvers and painters. The outsides of the houses, wherever there is a plank, are covered with rude yet characteristic figures. The high-peaked prows of their boats are ornamented with masses of open filagree work, cut out of solid blocks of wood, and often of very tasteful design, As a figurehead, or pinnacle, there is often a human figure, with a head of cassowary feathers to imitate the Papuan \"mop.\"\\nCARVED TOOL FOR MAKING POTTERY\\nThe floats of their fishing-lines, the wooden beaters used in tempering the clay for their pottery, their tobacco-boxes, and other household articles, are covered with carving of tasteful and often elegant design. Did we not already know that such taste and skill are compatible with utter barbarism, we could hardly believe that the same people are, in other matters, utterly wanting in all sense of order, comfort, or decency. Yet such is the case. They live in the most miserable, crazy, and filthy hovels, which are utterly destitute of anything that can be called furniture; not a stool, or bench, or board is seen in them, no brush seems to be known, and the clothes they wear are often filthy bark, or rags, or sacking. Along the paths where they daily pass to and from their provision grounds, not an overhanging bough or straggling briar ever seems to he cut, so that you have to brush through a rank vegetation, creep under fallen trees and spiny creepers, and wade through pools of mud and mire, which cannot dry up because the sun is not allowed to penetrate. Their food is almost wholly roots and vegetables, with fish or game only as an occasional luxury, and they are consequently very subject to various skin diseases, the children especially being often miserable-looking objects, blotched all over with eruptions and sores. If these people are not savages, where shall we find any? Yet they have all a decided love for the fine arts, and spend their leisure time in executing works whose good taste and elegance would often be admired in our schools of design!\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0During the latter part of my stay in New Guinea the weather was very wet, my only shooter was ill, and birds became scarce, so that my only resource was insect-hunting. I worked very hard every hour of fine weather, and daily obtained a number of new species. Every dead tree and fallen log was searched and searched again; and among the dry and rotting leaves, which still hung on certain trees which had been cut down, I found an abundant harvest of minute Coleoptera. Although I never afterwards found so many large and handsome beetles as in Borneo, yet I obtained here a great variety of species. For the first two or three weeks, while I was searching out the best localities, I took about 30 different kinds of beetles n day, besides about half that number of butterflies, and a few of the other orders. But afterwards, up to the very last week, I averaged 49 species a day. On the 31st of May, I took 78 distinct sorts, a larger number than I had ever captured before, principally obtained among dead trees and under rotten bark. A good long walk on a fine day up the hill, and to the plantations of the natives, capturing everything not very common that came in my way, would produce about 60 species; but on the last day of June I brought home no less than 95 distinct kinds of beetles, a larger number than I ever obtained in one day before or since. It was a fine hot day, and I devoted it to a search among dead leaves, beating foliage, and hunting under rotten bark, in all the best stations I had discovered during my walks. I was out from ten in the morning till three in the afternoon, and it took me six hours\\' work at home to pin and set out all the specimens, and to separate the species. Although T had already been working this shot daily for two months and a half, and had obtained over 800 species of Coleoptera, this day\\'s work added 32 new ones. Among these were 4 Longicorns, 2 Caribidae, 7 Staphylinidae, 7 Curculionidae, 2 Copridae, 4 Chrysomelidae, 3 Heteromera, 1 Elates, and 1 Buprestis. Even on the last day I went out, I obtained 10 new species; so that although I collected over a thousand distinct sorts of beetles in a space not much exceeding a square mile during the three months of my residence at Dorey, I cannot believe that this represents one half the species really inhabiting the same spot, or a fourth of what might be obtained in an area extending twenty miles in each direction.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 22cd of July the schooner Hester Helena arrived, and five days afterwards we bade adieu to Dorey, without much regret, for in no place which I have visited have I encountered more privations and annoyances. Continual rain, continual sickness, little wholesome food, with a plague of ants and files, surpassing anything I had before met with, required all a naturalist\\'s ardour to encounter; and when they were uncompensated by great success in collecting, became all the more insupportable. This long thought-of and much-desired voyage to New Guinea had realized none of my expectations. Instead of being far better than the Aru Islands, it was in almost everything much worse. Instead of producing several of the rarer Paradise birds, I had not even seen one of them, and had not obtained any one superlatively fine bird or insect. I cannot deny, however, that Dorey was very rich in ants. One small black kind was excessively abundant. Almost every shrub and tree was more or less infested with it, and its large papery nests were everywhere to be seen. They immediately took possession of my house, building a large nest in the roof, and forming papery tunnels down almost every post. They swarmed on my table as I was at work setting out my insects, carrying them off from under my very nose, and even tearing them from the cards on which they were gummed if I left them for an instant. They crawled continually over my hands and face, got into my hair, and roamed at will over my whole body, not producing much inconvenience till they began to bite, which they would do on meeting with any obstruction to their passage, and with a sharpness which made me jump again and rush to undress and turn out the offender. They visited my bed also, so that night brought no relief from their persecutions; and I verily believe that during my three and a half months\\' residence at Dorey I was never for a single hour entirely free from them. They were not nearly so voracious as many other kinds, but their numbers and ubiquity rendered it necessary to be constantly on guard against them.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The flies that troubled me most were a large kind of blue-bottle or blow-fly. These settled in swarms on my bird skins when first put out to dry, filling their plumage with masses of eggs, which, if neglected, the next day produced maggots. They would get under the wings or under the body where it rested on the drying-board, sometimes actually raising it up half an inch by the mass of eggs deposited in a few hours; and every egg was so firmly glued to the fibres of the feathers, as to make it a work of much time and patience to get them off without injuring the bird. In no other locality have I ever been troubled with such a plague as this.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 29th we left Dorey, and expected a quick voyage home, as it was the time of year when we ought to have had steady southerly and easterly winds. Instead of these, however, we had calms and westerly breezes, and it was seventeen days before we reached Ternate, a distance of five hundred miles only, which, with average winds, could have been done in five days. It was a great treat to me to find myself back again in my comfortable house, enjoying milk to my tea and coffee, fresh bread and butter, and fowl and fish daily for dinner. This New Guinea voyage had used us all up, and I determined to stay and recruit before I commenced any fresh expeditions. My succeeding journeys to Gilolo and Batchian have already been narrated, and if; now only remains for me to give an account of my residence in Waigiou, the last Papuan territory I visited in search of Birds of Paradise.\\nVOYAGE FROM CERAM TO WAIGIOU\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(JUNE AND JULY 1860)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0IN my twenty-fifth chapter I have described my arrival at Wahai, on my way to Mysol and Waigiou, islands which belong to the Papuan district, and the account of which naturally follows after that of my visit to the mainland of New Guinea. I now take up my narrative at my departure from Wahai, with the intention of carrying various necessary stores to my assistant, Mr. Allen, at Silinta, in Mysol, and then continuing my journey to Waigiou. It will be remembered that I was travelling in a small prau, which I had purchased and fitted up in Goram, and that, having been deserted by my crew on the coast of Ceram, I had obtained four men at Wahai, who, with my Amboynese hunter, constituted my crew.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Between Ceram and Mysol there are sixty miles of open sea, and along this wide channel the east monsoon blows strongly; so that with native praus, which will not lay up to the wind, it requires some care in crossing. In order to give ourselves sufficient leeway, we sailed back from Wahai eastward, along the coast of Ceram, with the land-breeze; but in the morning (June 18th) had not gone nearly so far as I expected. My pilot, an old and experienced sailor, named Gurulampoko, assured me there was a current setting to the eastward, and that we could easily lay across to Silinta, in Mysol. As we got out from the land the wind increased, and there was a considerable sea, which made my short little vessel plunge and roll about violently. By sunset -we had not got halfway across, but could see Mysol distinctly. All night we went along uneasily, and at daybreak, on looking out anxiously, I found that we had fallen much to the westward during the night, owing, no doubt, to the pilot being sleepy and not keeping the boat sufficiently close to the wind. We could see the mountains distinctly, but it was clear we should not reach Silinta, and should have some difficulty in getting to the extreme westward point of the island. The sea was now very boisterous, and our prau was continually beaten to leeward by the waves, and after another weary day we found w e could not get to Mysol at all, but might perhaps reach the island called Pulo Kanary, about ten miles to the north-west. Thence we might await a favourable wind to reach Waigamma, on the north side of the island, and visit Allen by means of a small boat.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0About nine o\\'clock at night, greatly to my satisfaction, we got under the lea of this island, into quite smooth water--for I had been very sick and uncomfortable, and had eaten scarcely anything since the preceding morning. We were slowly nearing the shore, which the smooth dark water told us we could safely approach; and were congratulating ourselves on soon being at anchor, with the prospect of hot coffee, a good supper, and a sound sleep, when the wind completely dropped, and we had to get out the oars to row. We were not more than two hundred yards from the shore, when I noticed that we seemed to get no nearer although the men were rowing hard, but drifted to the westward, and the prau would not obey the helm, but continually fell off, and gave us much trouble to bring her up again. Soon a laud ripple of water told us we were seized by one of those treacherous currents which so frequently frustrate all the efforts of the voyager in these seas; the men threw down the oars in despair, and in a few minutes we drifted to leeward of the island fairly out to sea again, and lost our last chance of ever reaching Mysol! Hoisting our jib, we lay to, and in the morning found ourselves only a few miles from the island, but wit, such a steady wind blowing from its direction as to render it impossible for us to get back to it.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now made sail to the northward, hoping soon to get a more southerly wind. Towards noon the sea was much smoother, and with a S.S.E. wind we were laying in the direction of Salwatty, which I hoped to reach, as I could there easily get a boat to take provisions and stores to my companion in Mysol. This wind did not, however, last long, but died away into a calm; and a light west wind springing up, with a dark bank of clouds, again gave us hopes of reaching Mysol. We were soon, however, again disappointed. The E.S.E. wind began to blow again with violence, and continued all night in irregular gusts, and with a short cross sea tossed us about unmercifully, and so continually took our sails aback, that we were at length forced to run before it with our jib only, to escape being swamped by our heavy mainsail. After another miserable and anxious night, we found that we had drifted westward of the island of Poppa, and the wind being again a little southerly, we made all sail in order to reach it. This we did not succeed in doing, passing to the north-west, when the wind again blew hard from the E.S.E., and our last hope of finding a refuge till better weather was frustrated. This was a very serious matter to me, as I could not tell how Charles Allen might act, if, after waiting in vain for me, he should return to Wahai, and find that I had left there long before, and had not since been heard of. Such an event as our missing an island forty miles long would hardly occur to him, and he would conclude either that our boat had foundered, or that my crew had murdered me and run away with her. However, as it was physically impossible now for me to reach him, the only thing to be done was to make the best of my way to Waigiou, and trust to our meeting some traders, who might convey to him the news of my safety.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Finding on my map a group of three small islands, twenty-five miles north of Poppa, I resolved, if possible, to rest there a day or two. We could lay our boat\\'s head N.E. by N.; but a heavy sea from the eastward so continually beat us off our course, and we made so much leeway, that I found it would be as much as we could do to reach them. It was a delicate point to keep our head in the best direction, neither so close to the wind as to stop our way, or so free as to carry us too far to leeward. I continually directed the steersman myself, and by incessant vigilance succeeded, just at sunset, in bringing our boat to an anchor under the lee of the southern point of one of the islands. The anchorage was, however, by no means good, there being a fringing coral reef, dry at low water, beyond which, on a bottom strewn with masses of coral, we were obliged to anchor. We had now been incessantly tossing about for four days in our small undecked boat, with constant disappointments and anxiety, and it was a great comfort to have a night of quiet and comparative safety. My old pilot had never left the helm for more than an hour at a time, when one of the others would relieve him for a little sleep; so I determined the next morning to look out for a secure and convenient harbour, and rest on shore for a day.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the morning, finding it would be necessary for us to get round a rocky point, I wanted my men to go on shore and cut jungle- rope, by which to secure us from being again drafted away, as the wind was directly off shore. I unfortunately, however, allowed myself to be overruled by the pilot and crew, who all declared that it was the easiest thing possible, and that they would row the boat round the point in a few minutes. They accordingly got up the anchor, set the jib, and began rowing; but, just as I had feared, we drifted rapidly off shore, and had to drop anchor again in deeper water, and much farther off. The two best men, a Papuan and a Malay now swam on shore, each carrying a hatchet, and went into the jungle to seek creepers for rope. After about an hour our anchor loosed hold, and began to drag. This alarmed me greatly, and we let go our spare anchor, and, by running out all our cable, appeared tolerably secure again. We were now most anxious for the return of the men, and were going to fire our muskets to recall them, when we observed them on the beach, some way off, and almost immediately our anchors again slipped, and we drifted slowly away into deep water. We instantly seized the oars, but found we could not counteract the wind and current, and our frantic cries to the men were not heard till we had got a long way off; as they seemed to be hunting for shell-fish on the beach. Very soon, however, they stared at us, and in a few minutes seemed to comprehend their situation; for they rushed down into the water, as if to swim off, but again returned on shore, as if afraid to make the attempt. We had drawn up our anchors at first not to check our rowing; but now, finding we could do nothing, we let them both hang down by the full length of the cables. This stopped our way very much, and we drifted from shore very slowly, and hoped the men would hastily form a raft, or cut down a soft-wood tree, and paddle out, to us, as we were still not more than a third of a mile from shore. They seemed, however, to have half lost their senses, gesticulating wildly to us, running along the beach, then going unto the forest; and just when we thought they had prepared some mode of making an attempt to reach us, we saw the smoke of a fire they had made to cook their shell-fish! They had evidently given up all idea of coming after us, and we were obliged to look to our own position.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We were now about a mile from shore, and midway between two of the islands, but we were slowly drifting out, to sea to the westward, and our only chance of yet saving the men was to reach the opposite shore. We therefore sot our jib and rowed hard; but the wind failed, and we drifted out so rapidly that we had some difficulty in reaching the extreme westerly point of the island. Our only sailor left, then swam ashore with a rope, and helped to tow us round the point into a tolerably safe and secure anchorage, well sheltered from the wind, but exposed to a little swell which jerked our anchor and made us rather uneasy. We were now in a sad plight, having lost our two best men, and being doubtful if we had strength left to hoist our mainsail. We had only two days\\' water on board, and the small, rocky, volcanic island did not promise us much chance of finding any. The conduct of the men on shore was such as to render it doubtful if they would make any serious attempt to reach us, though they might easily do so, having two good choppers, with which in a day they could male a small outrigger raft on which they could safely cross the two miles of smooth sea with the wind right aft, if they started from the east end of the island, so as to allow for the current. I could only hope they would be sensible enough to make the attempt, and determined to stay as long as I could to give them the chance.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We passed an anxious night, fearful of again breaking our anchor or rattan cable. In the morning (23rd), finding all secure, I waded on shore with my two men, leaving the old steersman and the cook on board, with a loaded musketto recall us if needed. We first walked along the beach, till stopped by the vertical cliffs at the east end of the island, finding a place where meat had been smoked, a turtle-shell still greasy, and some cut wood, the leaves of which were still green, showing that some boat had been here very recently. We then entered the jungle, cutting our way up to the top of the hill, but when we got there could see nothing, owing to the thickness of the forest. Returning, we cut some bamboos, and sharpened them to dig for water in a low spot where some sago -trees were growing; when, just as we were going to begin, Hoi, the Wahai man, called out to say he had found water. It was a deep hole among the Sago trees, in stiff black clay, full of water, which was fresh, but smelt horribly from the quantity of dead leaves and sago refuse that had fallen in. Hastily concluding that it was a spring, or that the water had filtered in, we baled it all out as well as a dozen or twenty buckets of mud and rubbish, hoping by night to have a good supply of clean water. I then went on board to breakfast, leaving my two men to make a bamboo raft to carry us on shore and back without wading. I had scarcely finished when our cable broke, and we bumped against the rocks. Luckily it was smooth and calm, and no damage was done. We searched for and got up our anchor, and found teat the cable had been cut by grating all night upon the coral. Had it given way in the night, we might have drifted out to sea without our anchor, or been seriously damaged. In the evening we went to fetch water from the well, when, greatly to our dismay, we found nothing but a little liquid mud at the bottom, and it then became evident that the hole was one which had been made to collect rain water, and would never fill again as long as the present drought continued. As we did not know what we might suffer for want of water, we filled our jar with this muddy stuff so that it might settle. In the afternoon I crossed over to the other side of the island, and made a large fire, in order that our men might see we were still there.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next day (24th) I determined to have another search for water; and when the tide was out rounded a rocky point and went to the extremity of the island without finding any sign of the smallest stream. On our way back, noticing a very small dry bed of a watercourse, I went up it to explore, although everything was so dry that my men loudly declared it was useless to expect water there; but a little way up I was rewarded by finding a few pints in a small pool. We searched higher up in every hole and channel where water marks appeared, but could find not a drop more. Sending one of my men for a large jar and teacup, we searched along the beach till we found signs of another dry watercourse, and on ascending this were so fortunate as to discover two deep sheltered rock-holes containing several gallons of water, enough to fill all our jars. When the cup came we enjoyed a good drink of the cool pure water, and before we left had carried away, I believe, every drop on the island.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the evening a good-sized prau appeared in sight, making apparently for the island where our men were left, and we had some hopes they might be seen and picked up, but it passed along mid-channel, and did not notice the signals we tried to make. I was now, however, pretty easy as to the fate of the men. There was plenty of sago on our rocky island, and there world probably be some on the fiat one they were left on. They had choppers, and could cut down a tree and make sago, and would most likely find sufficient water by digging. Shell-fish were abundant, and they would be able to manage very well till some boat should touch there, or till I could send and fetch them. The next day we devoted to cutting wood, filling up our jars with all the water we could find, and making ready to sail in the evening. I shot a small lory closely resembling a common species at Ternate, and a glossy starling which differed from the allied birds of Ceram and Matabello. Large wood-pigeons and crows were the only other birds I saw, but I did not obtain specimens.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0About eight in the evening of June 25th we started, and found that with all hands at work we could just haul up our mainsail. We had a fair wind during the night and sailed north-east, finding ourselves in the morning about twenty miles west of the extremity of Waigiou with a number of islands intervening. About ten o\\'clock we ran full on to a coral reef, which alarmed us a good deal, but luckily got safe off again. About two in the afternoon we reached an extensive coral reef, and were sailing close alongside of it, when the wind suddenly dropped, and we drifted on to it before we could get in our heavy mainsail, which we were obliged to let run down and fall partly overboard. We had much difficulty in getting off, but at last got into deep water again, though with reefs and islands all around us. At night we did not know what to do, as no one on board could tell where we were or what dangers might surround us, the only one of our crew who was acquainted with the coast of Waigiou having been. left on the island. We therefore took in all sail and allowed ourselves to drift, as we were some miles from the nearest land. A light breeze, however, sprang up, and about midnight we found ourselves again bumping over a coral reef. As it was very dark, and we knew nothing of our position, we could only guess how to get off again, and had there been a little more wind we might have been knocked to pieces. However, in about half an hour we did get off, and then thought it best to anchor on the edge of the reef till morning. Soon after daylight on the 7th, finding our prau had received no damage, we sailed on with uncertain winds and squalls, threading our way among islands and reefs, and guided only by a small map, which was very incorrect and quite useless, and by a general notion of the direction we ought to take. In the afternoon we found a tolerable anchorage under a small island and stayed for the night, and I shot a large fruit-pigeon new to me, which I have since named Carpophaga tumida. I also saw and shot at the rare white-headed kingfisher (Halcyon saurophaga), but did not kill it. The next morning we sailed on, and having a fair wind reached the shores of the large island of Waigiou. On rounding a point we again ran full on to a coral reef with our mainsail up, but luckily the wind had almost died away, and with a good deal of exertion we managed get safely off.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now had to search for the narrow channel among islands, which we knew was somewhere hereabouts, and which leads to the villages on the south side ofWaigiou. Entering a deep bay which looked promising, we got to the end of it, but it was then dusk, so we anchored for the night, and having just finished all our water could cook no rice for supper. Next morning early (29th) we went on shore among the mangroves, and a little way inland found some water, which relieved our anxiety considerably, and left us free to go along the coast in search of the opening, or of some one who could direct us to it. During the three days we had now been among the reefs and islands, we had only seen a single small canoe, which had approached pretty near to us, and then, notwithstanding our signals, went off in another direction. The shores seemed all desert; not a house, or boat, or human being, or a puff of smoke was to be seen; and as we could only go on the course that the ever-changing wind would allow us (our hands being too few to row any distance), our prospects of getting to our destination seemed rather remote and precarious. Having gone to the eastward extremity of the deep bay we had entered, without finding any sign of an opening, we turned westward; and towards evening were so fortunate as to find a small village of seven miserable houses built on piles in the water. Luckily the Orang- kaya, or head man, could speak a little. Malay, and informed us that the entrance to the strait was really in the bay we had examined, but that it was not to be seen except when- close inshore. He said the strait was often very narrow, and wound among lakes and rocks and islands, and that it would take two days to reach the large village of Muka, and three more to get to Waigiou. I succeeded in hiring two men to go with us to Muka, bringing a small boat in which to return; but we had to wait a day for our guides, so I took my gun and made a little excursion info the forest. The day was wet and drizzly, and I only succeeded in shooting two small birds, but I saw the great black cockatoo, and had a glimpse of one or two Birds of Paradise, whose loud screams we had heard on first approaching the coast. Leaving the village the next morning (July 1st) with a light wind, it took us all day to reach the entrance to the channel, which resembled a small river, and was concealed by a projecting point, so that it was no wonder we did not discover it amid the dense forest vegetation which everywhere covers these islands to the water\\'s edge. A little way inside it becomes bounded by precipitous rocks, after winding among which for about two miles, we emerged into what seemed a lake, but which was in fact a deep gulf having a narrow entrance on the south coast. This gulf was studded along its shores with numbers of rocky islets, mostly mushroom shaped, from the `eater having worn away the lower part of the soluble coralline limestone, leaving them overhanging from ten to twenty feet. Every islet was covered will strange-looping shrubs and trees, and was generally crowned by lofty and elegant palms, which also studded the ridges of the mountainous shores, forming one of the most singular and picturesque landscapes I have ever seen. The current which had brought us through the narrow strait now ceased, and we were obliged to row, which with our short and heavy prau was slow work. I went on shore several times, but the rocks were so precipitous, sharp, and honeycombed, that Ifound it impossible to get through the tangled thicket with which they were everywhere clothed. It took us three days to get to the entrance of the gulf, and then the wind was such as to prevent our going any further, and we might have had to wait for days or weeps, when, much to my surprise and gratification, a boat arrived from Muka with one of the head men, who had in some mysterious manner heard I was on my way, and had come to my assistance, bringing a present of cocoa-nuts and vegetables. Being thoroughly acquainted with the coast, and having several extra men to assist us, he managed to get the prau along by rowing, poling, or sailing, and by night had brought us safely into harbour, a great relief after our tedious and unhappy voyage. We had been already eight days among the reefs and islands of Waigiou, coming a distance of about fifty miles, and it was just forty days since we had sailed from Goram.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Immediately on our arrival at Muka, I engaged a small boat and three natives to go in search of my lost men, and sent one of my own men with them to make sure of their going to the right island. In ten days they returned, but to my great regret and disappointment, without the men. The weather had been very bad, and though they had reached an island within sight of that in which the men were, they could get no further. They had waited there six days for better weather, and then, having no more provisions, and the man I had sent with them being very ill and not expected to live, they returned. As they now knew the island, I was determined they should make another trial, and (by a liberal payment of knives, handkerchiefs, and tobacco, with plenty of provisions) persuaded them to start back immediately, and make another attempt. They did not return again till the 29th of July, having stayed a few days at their own village of Bessir on the way; but this time they had succeeded and brought with them my two lost men, in tolerable health, though thin and weak. They had lived exactly a month on the island had found water, and had subsisted on the roots and tender flower-stalks of a species of Bromelia, on shell-fish. and on a few turtles\\' eggs. Having swum to the island, they had only a pair of trousers and a shirt between them, but had made a hut of palm-leaves, and had altogether got on very well. They saw that I waited for them three days at the opposite island, but had been afraid to cross, lest the current should have carried them out to sea, when they would have been inevitably lost. They had felt sure I would send for them on the first opportunity, and appeared more grateful than natives usually are for my having done so; while I felt much relieved that my voyage, though sufficiently unfortunate, had not involved loss of life.\\nWAIGIOU\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(JULY TO SEPTEMER 1860)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0THE village of Muka, on the south coast of Waigiou, consists of a number of poor huts, partly in the water and partly on shore, and scattered irregularly over a space of about half a mile in a shallow bay. Around it are a few cultivated patches, and a good deal of second-growth woody vegetation; while behind, at the distance of about half a mile, rises the virgin forest, through which are a few paths to some houses and plantations a mile or two inland. The country round is rather flat, and in places swampy, and there are one or two small streams which run behind the village into the sea below it. Finding that no house could be had suitable to my purpose, and hawing so often experienced the advantages of living close to or just within the forest, I obtained the assistance of half-a-dozen men; and having selected a spot near the path and the stream, and close to a fine fig- tree, which stood just within the forest, we cleared the ground and set to building a house. As I did not expect to stay here so long as I had done at Dorey, I built a long, low, narrow shed, about seven feet high on one side and four on the other, which required but little wood, and was put up very rapidly. Our sails, with a few old attaps from a deserted but in the village, formed the walls, and a quantity of \"cadjans,\" or palm-leaf mats, covered in the roof. On the third day my house was finished, and all my things put in and comfortably arranged to begin work, and I was quite pleased at having got established so quickly and in such a nice situation.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It had been so far fine weather, but in the night it rained hard, and we found our mat roof would not keep out water. It first began to drop, and then to stream over everything. I had to get up in the middle of the night to secure my insect-boxes, rice, and other perishable articles, and to find a dry place to sleep in, for my bed was soaked. Fresh leaks kept forming as the rain continued, and w e all passed a very miserable and sleepless night. In the morning the sun shone brightly, and everything was put out to dry. We tried to find out why the mats leaked, and thought we had discovered that they had been laid on upside down. Having shifted there all, and got everything dry and comfortable by the evening, we again went to bed, and before midnight were again awaked by torrent of rain and leaks streaming in upon us as bad as ever. There was no more sleep for us that night, and the next day our roof was again taken to pieces, and we came to the conclusion that the fault was a want of slope enough in the roof for mats, although it would be sufficient for the usual attap thatch. I therefore purchased a few new and some old attaps, and in the parts these would not cover we put the mats double, and then at last had the satisfaction of finding our roof tolerably water-tight.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I was now able to begin working at the natural history of the island. When I first arrived I was surprised at being told that there were no Paradise Birds at Muka, although there were plenty at Bessir, a place where the natives caught them and prepared the skins. I assured the people I had heard the cry of these birds close to the village, but they world not believe that I could know their cry. However, the very first time I went into the forest I not only heard but saw them, and was convinced there were plenty about; but they were very shy, and it was some time before we got any. My hunter first shot a female, and I one day got very close to a fine male. He was, as I expected, the rare red species, Paradisea rubra, which alone inhabits this island, and is found nowhere else. He was quite low down, running along a bough searching for insects, almost like a woodpecker, and the long black riband-like filaments in his tail hung down in the most graceful double curve imaginable. I covered him with my gun, and was going to use the barrel which had a very small charge of powder and number eight shot, so as not to injure his plumage, but the gun missed fire, and he was off in an instant among the thickest jungle. Another day we saw no less than eight fine males at different times, and fired four times at them; but though other birds at the same distance almost always dropped, these all got away, and I began to think we were not to get this magnificent species. At length the fruit ripened on the fig-tree close by my house, and many birds came to feed on it; and one morning, as I was taking my coffee, a male Paradise Bird was seen to settle on its top. I seized my gun, ran under the tree, and, gazing up, could see it flying across from branch to branch, seizing a fruit here and another there, and then, before I could get a sufficient aim to shoot at such a height (for it was one of the loftiest trees of the tropics), it was away into the forest. They now visited the tree every morning; but they stayed so short a time, their motions were so rapid, and it was so difficult to see them, owing to the lower trees, which impeded the view, that it was only after several days\\' watching, and one or two misses, that I brought down my bird--a male in the most magnificent plumage.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This bird differs very much from the two large species which I had already obtained, and, although it wants the grace imparted by their long golden trains, is in many respects more remarkable and more beautiful. The head, back, and shoulders are clothed with a richer yellow, the deep metallic green colour of the throat extends further over the head, and the feathers are elongated on the forehead into two little erectile crests. The side plumes are shorter, but are of a rich red colour, terminating in delicate white points, and the middle tail- feathers are represented by two long rigid glossy ribands, which are black, thin, and semi-cylindrical, and droop gracefully in a spiral curve. Several other interesting birds were obtained, and about half-a-dozen quite new ones; but none of any remarkable beauty, except the lovely little dove, Ptilonopus pulchellus, which with several other pigeons I shot on the same fig-tree close to my house. It is of a beautiful green colour above, with a forehead of the richest crimson, while beneath it is ashy white and rich yellow, banded with violet red.\\nTHE RED BIRD OF PARADISE (Paradisea rubra.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the evening of our arrival at Muka I observed what appeared like a display of Aurora Borealis, though I could hardly believe that this was possible at a point a little south of the equator. The night was clear and calm, and the northern sky presented a diffused light, with a constant succession of faint vertical flashings or flickerings, exactly similar to an ordinary aurora in England. The next day was fine, but after that the weather was unprecedentedly bad, considering that it ought to have been the dry monsoon. For near a month we had wet weather; the sun either not appearing at all, or only for an hour or two about noon. Morning and evening, as well as nearly all night, it rained or drizzled, and boisterous winds, with dark clouds, formed the daily programme. With the exception that it was never cold, it was just such weather as a very bad English November or February.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The people of Waigiou are not truly indigenes of the island, which possesses no \"Alfuros,\" or aboriginal inhabitants. [footnote: Dr. Guillemard met with some people who, he was told, were true indigenes.  But it would be difficult to determine the point without a tolerably complete knowledge of all the surrounding islands and their languages.] They appear to be a mixed race, partly from Gilolo, partly from New Guinea. Malays and Alfuros from the former island have probably settled here, and many of them have taken Papuan wives from Salwatty or Dorey, while the influx of people from those places, and of slaves, has led to the formation of a tribe exhibiting almost all the transitions from a nearly pure Malayan to an entirely Papuan type. The language spoken by them is entirely Papuan, being that which is used on all the coasts of Mysol, Salwatty, the north-west of New Guinea, and the islands in the great Geelvink Bay,--a fact which indicates the way in which the coast settlements have been formed. The fact that so many of the islands between New Guinea and the Moluccas--such as Waigiou, Guebe, Poppa, Obi, Batchian, as well as the south and east peninsulas of Gilolo--possess no aboriginal tribes, but are inhabited by people who are evidently mongrels and wanderers, is a remarkable corroborative proof of the distinctness of the Malayan and Papuan races, and the separation of the geographical areas they inhabit. If these two great races were direct modifications, the one of the other, we should expect to find in the intervening region some homogeneous indigenous race presenting intermediate characters. For example, between the whitest inhabitants of Europe and the black Klings of South India, there are in the intervening districts homogeneous races which form a gradual transition from one to the other; while in America, although there is a perfect transition from the Anglo- Saxon to the negro, and from the Spaniard to the Indian, there is no homogeneous race forming a natural transition from one to the other. In the Malay Archipelago we have an excellent example of two absolutely distinct races, which appear to have approached each other, and intermingled in an unoccupied territory at a very recent epoch in the history of man; and I feel satisfied that no unprejudiced person could study them on the spot without being convinced that this is the true solution of the problem, rather than the almost universally accepted view that they are but modifications of one and the same race.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The people of Muka live in that abject state of poverty that is almost always found where the sago-tree is abundant. Very few of them take the trouble to plant any vegetables or fruit, but live almost entirely on sago and fish, selling a little tripang or tortoiseshell to buy the scanty clothing they require. Almost all of them, however, possess one or more Papuan slaves, on whose labour they live in almost absolute idleness, just going out on little fishing or trading excursions, as an excitement in their monotonous existence. They are under the rule of the Sultan of Tidore, and every year have to pay a small tribute of Paradise birds, tortoiseshell, or sago. To obtain these, they go in the fine season on a trading voyage to the mainland of New Guinea, and getting a few goods on credit from some Ceram or Bugis trader, make hard bargains with the natives, and gain enough to pay their tribute, and leave a little profit for themselves.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Such a country is not a very pleasant one to live in, for as there are no superfluities, there is nothing to sell; and had it not been for a trader from Ceram who was residing there during my stay, who had a small vegetable garden, and whose men occasionally got a few spare fish, I should often have had nothing to eat. Fowls, fruit, and vegetables are luxuries very rarely to be purchased at Muka; and even cocoa-nuts, so indispensable for eastern cookery, are not to be obtained; for though there are some hundreds of trees in the village, all the fruit is eaten green, to supply the place of the vegetables the people are too lazy to cultivate. Without eggs, cocoa-nuts, or plantains, we had very short commons, and the boisterous weather being unpropitious for fishing, we had to live on what few eatable birds we could shoot, with an occasional cuscus, or eastern opossum, the only quadruped, except pigs, inhabiting the island.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I had only shot two male Paradiseas on my tree when they ceased visiting it, either owing to the fruit becoming scarce, or that they were wise enough to know there was danger. We continued to hear and see them in the forest, but after a month had not succeeded in shooting any more; and as my chief object in visiting Waigiou was to get these birds, I determined to go to Bessir, where there are a number of Papuans who catch and preserve them. I hired a small outrigger boat for this journey, and left one of my men to guard my house and goods. We had to wait several days for fine weather, and at length started early one morning, and arrived late at night, after a rough and disagreeable passage. The village of Bessir was built in the water at the point of a small island. The chief food of the people was evidently shell-fish, since great heaps of the shells had accumulated in the shallow water between the houses and the land, forming a regular \"kitchen-midden \"for the exploration of some future archeologist. We spent the night in the chief\\'s house, and the next morning went over to the mainland to look out for a place where I could reside. This part of Waigiou is really another island to the south of the narrow channel we had passed through in coming to Muka. It appears to consist almost entirely of raised coral, whereas the northern island contains hard crystalline rocks. The shores were a range of low limestone cliffs, worn out by the water, so that the upper part generally overhung. At distant intervals were little coves and openings, where small streams came down from the interior; and in one of these we landed, pulling our boat up on a patch of white sandy beach. Immediately above was a large newly-made plantation of yams and plantains, and a small hot, which the chief said we might have the use of, if it would do for me. It was quite a dwarf\\'s house, just eight feet square, raised on posts so that the floor was four and a half feet above the ground, and the highest part of the ridge only five feet above the flour. As I am six feet and an inch in my stockings, I looked at this with some dismay; but finding that the other houses were much further from water, were dreadfully dirty, and were crowded with people, I at once accepted the little one, and determined to make the best of it. At first I thought of taking out the floor, which would leave it high enough to walk in and out without stooping; but then there would not be room enough, so I left it just as it was, had it thoroughly cleaned out, and brought up my baggage.\\nMY HOUSE AT BESSIR, IN WAIGIOU\\nThe upper story I used for sleeping in, and for a store-room. In the lower part (which was quite open all round) I fixed up a small table, arranged my boxes, put up hanging-shelves, laid a mat on the ground with my wicker-chair upon it, hung up another mat on the windward side, and then found that, by bending double and carefully creeping in, I could sit on my chair with my head just clear of the ceiling. Here I lived pretty comfortably for six weeks, taking all my meals and doing all my work at my little table, to and from which I had to creep in a semi-horizontal position a dozen times a day; and, after a few severe knocks on the head by suddenly rising from my chair, learnt to accommodate myself to circumstances. We put up a little sloping cooking-but outside, and a bench on which my lads could skin their birds. At night I went up to my little loft, they spread their mats on the, floor below, and we none of us grumbled at our lodgings.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My first business was to send for the men who were accustomed to catch the Birds of Paradise. Several came, and I showed them my hatchets, beads, knives, and handkerchiefs; and explained to them, as well as I could by signs, the price I would give for fresh-killed specimens. It is the universal custom to pay for everything in advance; but only one man ventured on this occasion to take goods to the value of two birds. The rest were suspicious, and wanted to see the result of the first bargain with the strange white man, the only one who had ever come to their island. After three days, my man brought me the first bird- -a very fine specimen, and alive, but tied up in a small bag, and consequently its tail and wing feathers very much crushed and injured. I tried to explain to him, and to the others that came with him, that I wanted them as perfect as possible, and that they should either kill them, or keep them on a perch with a string to their leg. As they were now apparently satisfied that all was fair, and that I had no ulterior designs upon them, six others took away goods; some for one bird, some for more, and one for as many as six. They said they had to go a long way for them, and that they would come back as soon as they caught any. At intervals of a few days or a week, some of them would return, bringing me one or more birds; but though they did not bring any more in bags, there was not much improvement in their condition. As they caught them a long way off in the forest, they would scarcely ever come with one, but would tie it by the leg to a stick, and put it in their house till they caught another. The poor creature would make violent efforts to escape, would get among the ashes, or hang suspended by the leg till the limb was swollen and half-putrefied, and sometimes die of starvation and worry. One had its beautiful head all defiled by pitch from a dammar torch; another had been so long dead that its stomach was turning green. Luckily, however, the skin and plumage of these birds is so firm and strong, that they bear washing and cleaning better than almost any other sort; and I was generally able to clean them so well that they did not perceptibly differ from those I had shot myself.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some few were brought me the same day they were caught, and I had an opportunity of examining them in all their beauty and vivacity. As soon as I found they were generally brought alive, I set one of my men to make a large bamboo cage with troughs for food and water, hoping to be able to keep some of them. I got the natives to bring me branches of a fruit they were very fond of, and I was pleased to find they ate it greedily, and would also take any number of live grasshoppers I gave them, stripping off the legs and wings, and then swallowing them. They drank plenty of water, and were in constant motion, jumping about the cage from perch to perch, clinging on the top and sides, and rarely resting a moment the first day till nightfall. The second day they were always less active, although they would eat as freely as before; and on the morning of the third day they were almost always found dead at the bottom of the cage, without any apparent cause. Some of them ate boiled rice as well as fruit and insects; but after trying many in succession, not one out of ten lived more than three days. The second or third day they would be dull, and in several cases they were seized with convulsions, and fell off the perch, dying a few hours afterwards. I tried immature as well as full-plumaged birds, but with no better success, and at length gave it up as a hopeless task, and confined my attention to preserving specimens in as good a condition as possible.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Red Birds of Paradise are not shot with blunt arrows, as in the Aru Islands and some parts of New Guinea, but are snared in a very ingenious manner. A large climbing Arum bears a red reticulated fruit, of which the birds are very fond. The hunters fasten this fruit on a stout forked stick, and provide themselves with a fine but strong cord. They then seep out some tree in the forest on which these birds are accustomed to perch, and climbing up it fasten the stick to a branch and arrange the cord in a noose so ingeniously, that when the bird comes to eat the fruit its legs are caught, and by pulling the end of the cord, which hangs down to the ground, it comes free from the branch and brings down the bird. Sometimes, when food is abundant elsewhere, the hunter sits from morning till night under his tree with the cord in his hand, and even for two or three whole days in succession, without even getting a bite; while, on the other hand, if very lucky, he may get two or three birds in a day. There are only eight or ten men at Bessir who practise this art, which is unknown anywhere else in the island. I determined, therefore, to stay as long as possible, as my only chance of getting a good series of specimens; and although I was nearly starved, everything eatable by civilized man being scarce or altogether absent, I finally succeeded.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The vegetables and fruit in the plantations around us did not suffice for the wants of the inhabitants, and were almost always dug up or gathered before they were ripe. It was very rarely we could purchase a little fish; fowls there were none; and we were reduced to live upon tough pigeons and cockatoos, with our rice and sago, and sometimes we could not get these. Having been already eight months on this voyage, my stock of all condiments, spices and butter, was exhausted, and I found it impossible to eat sufficient of my tasteless and unpalatable food to support health. I got very thin and weak, and had a curious disease known (I have since heard) as brow-ague. Directly after breakfast every morning an intense pain set in on a small spot on the right temple. It was a severe burning ache, as bad as the worst toothache, and lasted about two hours, generally going off at noon. When this finally ceased, I had an attack of fever, which left me so weak and so unable to eat our regular food, that I feel sure my life was saved by a couple of tins of soup which I had long reserved for some such extremity. I used often to go out searching after vegetables, and found a great treasure in a lot of tomato plants run wild, and bearing little fruits about the size of gooseberries. I also boiled up the tops of pumpkin plants and of ferns, by way of greens, and occasionally got a few green papaws. The natives, when hard up for food, live upon a fleshy seaweed, which they boil till it is tender. I tried this also, but found it too salt and bitter to be endured.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Towards the end of September it became absolutely necessary for me to return, in order to make our homeward voyage before the end of the east monsoon. Most of the men who had taken payment from me had brought the birds they had agreed for. One poor fellow had been so unfortunate as not to get one, and he very honestly brought back the axe he had received in advance; another, who had agreed for six, brought me the fifth two days before I was to start, and went off immediately to the forest again to get the other. He did not return, however, and we loaded our boat, and were just on the point of starting, when he came running down after us holding up a bird, which he handed to me, saying with great satisfaction, \"Now I owe you nothing.\" These were remarkable and quite unexpected instances of honesty among savages, where it would have been very easy for them to have been dishonest without fear of detection or punishment.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The country round about Bessir was very hilly and rugged, bristling with jagged and honey-combed coralline rocks, and with curious little chasms and ravines. The paths often passed through these rocky clefts, which in the depths of the forest were gloomy and dark in the extreme, and often full of fine-leaved herbaceous plants and curious blue-foliaged Lycopodiaceae. It was in such places as these that I obtained many of my most beautiful small butterflies, such as Sospita statira and Taxila pulchra, the gorgeous blue Amblypodia hercules, and many others. On the skirts of the plantations I found the handsome blue Deudorix despoena, and in the shady woods the lovely Lycaena wallacei. Here, too, I obtained the beautiful Thyca aruna, of the richest orange on the upper side; while below it is intense crimson and glossy black; and a superb specimen of a green Ornithoptera, absolutely fresh and perfect, and which still remains one of the glories of my cabinet.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0My collection of birds, though not very rich in number of species, was yet very interesting. I got another specimen of the rare New Guinea kite (Henicopernis longicauda), a large new goatsucker (Podargus superciliaris), and a most curious ground- pigeon of an entirely new genus, and remarkable for its long and powerful bill. It has been named Henicophaps albifrons. I was also much pleased to obtain a fine series of a large fruit-pigeon with a protuberance on the bill (Carpophaga tumida), and to ascertain that this was not, as had been hitherto supposed, a sexual character, but was found equally in male and female birds. I collected only seventy-three species of birds in Waigiou, but twelve of them were entirely new, and many others very rare; and as I brought away with me twenty-four fine specimens of the Paradisea rubra, I did not regret my visit to the island, although it had by no means answered my expectations.\\nVOYAGE FROM WAIGIOU TO TERNATE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(SEPTEMBER 29 to NOVEMBER 5, 1860)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I HAD left the old pilot at Waigiou to take care of my house and to get the prau into sailing order--to caulk her bottom, and to look after the upper works, thatch, and ringing. When I returned I found it nearly ready, and immediately began packing up and preparing for the voyage. Our mainsail had formed one side of our house, but the spanker and jib had been put away in the roof, and on opening them to see if any repairs were wanted, to our horror we found that some rats had made them their nest, and had gnawed through them in twenty places. We had therefore to buy matting and make new sails, and this delayed us till the 29th of September, when we at length left Waigiou.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It took us four days before we could get clear of the land, having to pass along narrow straits beset with reefs and shoals, and full of strong currents, so that an unfavourable wind stopped us altogether. One day, when nearly clear, a contrary tide and head wind drove us ten miles back to our anchorage of the night before. This delay made us afraid of running short of water if we should be becalmed at sea, and we therefore determined, if possible, to touch at the island where our men had been lost, and which lay directly in our proper course. The wind was, however, as usual, contrary, being S.S.W. instead of S.S.E., as it should have been at this time of the year, and all we could do was to reach the island of Gagie, where we came to an anchor by moonlight under bare volcanic hills. In the morning we tried to enter a deep bay, at the head of which some Galela fishermen told us there was water, but a head-wind prevented us. For the reward of a handkerchief, however, they took us to the place in their boat, and we filled up our jars and bamboos. We then went round to their camping-place on the north coast of the island to try and buy something to eat, but could only get smoked turtle meat as black and as hard as lumps of coal. A little further on there was a plantation belonging to Guebe people, but under the care of a Papuan slave, and the next morning we got some plantains and a few vegetables in exchange for a handkerchief and some knives. On leaving this place our anchor had got foul in some rock or sunken log in very deep water, and after many unsuccessful attempts, we were forced to cut our rattan cable and leave it behind us. We had now only one anchor left.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Starting early, on the 4th of October, the same S.S.W wind continued, and we began to fear that we should hardly clear the southern point of Gilolo. The night of the 5th was squally, with thunder, but after midnight it got tolerably fair, and we were going along with a light wind arid looking out for the coast of Gilolo, which we thought we must be nearing, when we heard a dull roaring sound, like a heavy surf, behind us. In a short time the roar increased, and we saw a white line of foam coming on, which rapidly passed us without doing any harm, as our boat rose easily over the wave. At short intervals, ten or a dozen others overtook us with bleat rapidity, and then the sea became perfectly smooth, as it was before. I concluded at once that these must be earthquake waves; and on reference to the old voyagers we find that these seas have been long subject to similar phenomena. Dampier encountered them near Mysol and New Guinea, and describes them as follows: \"We found here very strange tides, that ran in streams, making a great sea, and roaring so loud that we could hear them before they came within a mile of us. The sea round about them seemed all broken, and tossed the ship so that she would not answer her helm. These ripplings commonly lasted ten or twelve minutes, and then the sea became as still and smooth as a millpond. We sounded often when in the midst of them, but found no ground, neither could we perceive that they drove us any way. We had in one night several of these tides, that came mostly from the west, and the wind being from that quarter we commonly heard them a long time before they came, and sometimes lowered our topsails, thinking it was a gust of wind. They were of great length, from north to south, but their breadth not exceeding 200 yards, and they drove a great pace. For though we had little wind to move us, yet these world soon pass away, and leave the water very smooth, and just before we encountered them we met a great swell, but it did not break.\" Some time afterwards, I learnt that an earthquake had been felt on the coast of Gilolo the very day we had encountered these curious waves.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When daylight came, we saw the land of Gilolo a few miles off, but the point was unfortunately a little to windward of us. We tried to brace up all we could to round it, but as we approached the shore we got into a strong current setting northward, which carried us so rapidly with it that we found it necessary to stand off again, in order to get out of its influence. Sometimes we approached the point a little, and our hopes revived; then the wind fell, and we drifted slowly away. Night found us in nearly the same position as we had occupied in the morning, so we hung down our anchor with about fifteen fathoms of cable to prevent drifting. On the morning of the 7th we were however, a good way up the coast, and we now thought our only chance would be to got close in-shore, where there might be a return current, and we could then row. The prau was heavy, and my men very poor creatures for work, so that it took us six hours to get to the edge of the reef that fringed the shore; and as the wind might at any moment blow on to it, our situation was a very dangerous one. Luckily, a short distance off there was a sandy bay, where a small stream stopped the growth of the coral; and by evening we reached this and anchored for the night. Here we found some Galela men shooting deer and pigs; but they could not or would not speak Malay, and we could get little information from them. We found out that along shore the current changed with the tide, while about a mile out it was always one way, and against us; and this gave us some hopes of getting back to the point, from which we were now distant twenty miles. Next morning we found that the Galela men had left before daylight, having perhaps some vague fear of our intentions, anal very likely taking me for a pirate. During the morning a boat passed, and the people informed us that, at a short distance further towards the point, there was a much better harbour, where there were plenty of Galela men, from whom we, might probably get some assistance.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At three in the afternoon, when the current turned, we started; but having a head-wind, made slow progress. At dusk we reached the entrance of the harbour, but an eddy and a gust of wind carried us away and out to sea. After sunset there was a land breeze, and we sailed a little to the south-east. It then became calm, and eve hung down our anchor forty fathoms, to endeavour to counteract the current; but it was of little avail, and in the morning we found ourselves a good way from shore, and just opposite our anchorage of the day before, which we again reached by hard rowing. I gave the men this day to rest and sleep; and the next day (Oct. 10th) we again started at two in the morning with a land breeze. After I had set them to their oars, and given instructions to keep close in-shore, and on no account to get out to sea, I went below, being rather unwell. At daybreak I found, to my great astonishment, that we were again far off-shore, and was told that the wind had gradually turned more ahead, and had carried us out--none of them having the sense to take down the sail and row in-shore, or to call me. As soon as it was daylight, we saw that we had drifted back, and were again opposite our former anchorage, and, for the third time, had to row hard to get to it. As we approached the shore, I saw that the current was favourable to us, and we continued down the coast till we were close to the entrance to the lower harbour. Just as we were congratulating ourselves on having at last reached it, a strong south-east squall carne on, blowing us back, and rendering it impossible for us to enter. Not liking the idea of again returning, I determined on trying to anchor, and succeeded in doing so, in very deep water and close to the reefs; but the prevailing winds were such that, should we not hold, we should have no difficulty in getting out to sea. By the time the squall had passed, the current had turned against us, and we expected to have to wait till four in the afternoon, when we intended to enter the harbour.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Now, however, came the climax of our troubles. The swell produced by the squall made us jerk our cable a good deal, and it suddenly snapped low down in the water. We drifted out to sea, and immediately set our mainsail, but we were now without any anchor, and in a vessel so poorly manned that it could not be rowed against the most feeble current or the slightest wind, it word be madness to approach these dangerous shores except in the most perfect calm. We had also only three days\\' food left. It was therefore out of the question making any further attempts to get round the point without assistance, and I at once determined to run to the village of Gani-diluar, about ten miles further north, where we understood there was a good harbour, and where we might get provisions and a few more rowers. Hitherto winds and currents load invariably opposed our passage southward, and we might have expected them to be favourable to us now we had turned our bowsprit in an opposite direction. But it immediately fell calm, and then after a time a westerly land breeze set in, which would not serve us, and we had to row again for hours, and when night came had not reached the village. We were so fortunate, however, as to find a deep sheltered cove where the water was quite smooth, and we constructed a temporary anchor by filling a sack with stones from our ballast, which being well secured by a network of rattans held us safely during the night. The next morning my men went on shore to cut wood suitable for making fresh anchors, and about noon, the current turning in our favour, we proceeded to the village, where we found an excellent and well-protected anchorage.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On inquiry, we found that the head men resided at the other Gani on the western side of the peninsula, and it was necessary to send messengers across (about half a day\\'s journey) to inform them of my arrival, and to beg them to assist me. I then succeeded in buying a little sago, some dried deer-meat and cocoa-nuts, which at once relieved our immediate want of something to eat. At night we found our bag of atones still held us very well, and we slept tranquilly.\\nMALAY ANCHOR\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next day (October 12th), my men set to work making anchors and oars. The native Malay anchor is ingeniously constructed of a piece of tough forked timber, the fluke being strengthened by twisted rattans binding it to the stem, while the cross-piece is formed of a long flat stone, secured in the same manner. These anchors when well made, hold exceedingly arm, and, owing to the expense of iron, are still almost universally used on board the smaller praus. In the afternoon the head men arrived, and promised me as many rowers as I could put on the prau, and also brought me a few eggs and a little rice, which were very acceptable. On the 14th there was a north wind all day, which would have been invaluable to us a few days earlier, but which was now only tantalizing. On the 16th, all being ready, we started at daybreak with two new anchors and ten rowers, who understood their work. By evening we had come more than half-way to the point, and anchored for the night in a small bay. At three the next morning I ordered the anchor up, but the rattan cable parted close to the bottom, having been chafed by rocks, and we then lost our third anchor on this unfortunate voyage. The day was calm, and by noon we passed the southern point of Gilolo, which had delayed us eleven days, whereas the whole voyage during this monsoon should not have occupied more than half that time. Having got round the point our course was exactly in the opposite direction to what it had been, and now, as usual, the wind changed accordingly, coming from the north and north-west,--so that we still had to row every mile up to the village of Gani, which we did not reach till the evening of the 18th. A Bugis trader who was residing there, and the Senaji, or chief, were very kind; the former assisting me with a spare anchor and a cable, and making me a present of some vegetables, and the latter baking fresh sago cakes for my men; and giving rue a couple of fowls, a bottle of oil, and some pumpkins. As the weather was still very uncertain, I got four extra men to accompany me to Ternate, for which place we started on the afternoon of the 20th.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We had to keep rowing all night, the land breezes being too weak to enable us to sail against the current. During the afternoon of the 21st we had an hour\\'s fair wind, which soon changed into a heavy squall with rain, and my clumsy men let the mainsail get taken aback and nearly upset us, tearing the sail; and, what was worse, losing an hour\\'s fair wind. The night was calm, and we made little progress.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 22cd we had light head-winds. A little before noon we passed, with the assistance of our oars, the Paciencia Straits, the narrowest part of the channel between Batchian and Gilolo. These were well named by the early Portuguese navigators, as the currents are very strong, and there are so many eddies, that even with a fair wind vessels are often quite unable to pass through them. In the afternoon a strong north wind (dead ahead) obliged us to anchor twice. At nigh it was calm, and we crept along slowly with our oars.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 23rd we still had the wind ahead, or calms. We then crossed over again to the mainland of Gilolo by the advice of our Gani men, who knew the coast well. Just as we got across we had another northerly squall with rain, and had to anchor on the edge of a coral reef for the night. I called up my men about three on the morning of the 24th, but there was no wind to help us, and we rowed along slowly. At daybreak there was a fair breeze from the south, but it lasted only an hour. All the rest of the day we had nothing but calms, light winds ahead, and squalls, and made very little progress.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 25th we drifted out to the middle of the channel, but made no progress onward. In the afternoon we sailed and rowed to the south end of Kaióa, and by midnight reached the village. I determined to stay here a few days to rest and recruit, and in hopes of getting better weather. I bought some onions and other vegetables, and plenty of eggs, and my men baked fresh sago cakes. I went daily to my old hunting-ground in search of insects, but with very poor success. It was now wet, squally weather, and there appeared a stagnation of insect life. We Staved five days, during which time twelve persons died in the village, mostly from simple intermittent fever, of the treatment of which the natives are quite ignorant. During the whole of this voyage I had suffered greatly from sunburnt lips, owing to having exposed myself on deck all day to loon after our safety among the shoals and reefs near Waigiou. The salt in the air so affected them that they would not heal, but became excessively painful, and bled at the slightest touch, and for a long time it was with great difficulty I could eat at all, being obliged to open my mouth very wide, and put in each mouthful with the greatest caution. I kept them constantly covered with ointment, which was itself very disagreeable, and they caused me almost constant pain for more than a month, as they did not get well till I had returned to Ternate, and was able to remain a week indoors.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A boat which left for Ternate, the day after we arrived, was obliged to return the next day, on account of bad weather. On the 31st we went out to the anchorage at the mouth of the harbour, so as to be ready to start at the first favourable opportunity.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the 1st of November I called up my men at one in the morning, and we started with the tide in our favour. Hitherto it had usually been calm at night, but on this occasion we had a strong westerly squall with rain, which turned our prau broadside, and obliged us to anchor. When it had passed we went on rowing all night, but the wind ahead counteracted the current in our favour, and we advanced but little. Soon after sunrise the wind became stronger and more adverse, and as we had a dangerous lee-shore which we could not clear, we had to put about and get an offing to the W.S.W. This series of contrary winds and bad weather ever since we started, not having had a single day of fair wind, was very remarkable. My men firmly believed there was something unlucky in the boat, and told me I ought to have had a certain ceremony gone through before starting, consisting of boring a hole in the bottom and pouring some kind of holy oil through it. It must be remembered that this was the season of the south-east monsoon, and yet we had not had even half a day\\'s south-east wind since we left Waigiou. Contrary winds, squalls, and currents drifted us about the rest of the day at their pleasure. The night was equally squally and changeable, and kept us hard at work taking in and making sail, and rowing in the intervals.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Sunrise on the 2cd found us in the middle of the ten-mile channel between Kaióa and Makian. Squalls and showers succeeded each other during the morning. At noon there was a dead calm, after which a light westerly breeze enabled us to reach a village on Makian in the evening. Here I bought some pumelos (Citrus decumana), kanary-nuts, and coffee, and let my men have a night\\'s sleep.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The morning of the 3rd was fine, and we rowed slowly along the coast of Makian. The captain of a small prau at anchor, seeing me on deck and guessing who I was, made signals for us to stop, and brought me a letter from Charles Allen, who informed me he had been at Ternate twenty days, and was anxiously waiting my arrival. This was good news, as I was equally anxious about him, and it cheered up my spirits. A light southerly wind now sprung up, and we thought we were going to have fine weather. It soon changed, however, to its old quarter, the west; dense clouds gathered over the sky, and in less than half an hour we had the severest squall we had experienced during our whole voyage. Luckily we got our great mainsail down in time, or the consequences might have been serious. It was a regular little hurricane, and my old Bugis steersman began shouting out to \"Allah! il Allah!\" to preserve us. We could only keep up our jib, which was almost blown to rags, but by careful handling it kept us before the wind, and the prau behaved very well. Our small boat (purchased at Gani) was towing astern, and soon got full of water, so that it broke away and we saw no more of it. In about an hour the fury of the wind abated a little, and in two more we were able to hoist our mainsail, reefed and half-mast high. Towards evening it cleared up and fell calm, and the sea, which had been rather high, soon went down. Not being much of a seaman myself I had been considerably alarmed, and even the old steersman assured me he had never been in a worse squall all his life. He was now more than ever confirmed in his opinion of the unluckiness of the boat, and in the efficiency of the holy oil which all Bugis praus had poured through their bottoms. As it was, he imputed our safety and the quick termination of the squall entirely to his own prayers, saying with a laugh, \"Yes, that\\'s the way we always do on board our praus; when things are at the worst we stand up and shout out our prayers as loud as we can, and then Tuwan Allah helps us.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After this it took us two days more to reach Ternate, having our usual calms, squalls, and head-winds to the very last; and once having to return back to our anchorage owing to violent gusts of wind just as we were close to the town. Looking at my whole voyage in this vessel from the time when I left Goram in May, it will appear that rely experiences of travel in a native prau have not been encouraging. My first crew ran away; two men were lost for a month on a desert island; we were ten times aground on coral reefs; we lost four anchors; the sails were devoured by rats; the small boat was lost astern; we were thirty-eight days on the voyage home, which should not have taken twelve; we were many times short of food and water; we had no compass-lamp, owing to there not being a drop of oil in Waigiou when we left; and to crown all, during the whole of our voyages from Goram by Ceram to Waigiou, and from Waigiou to Ternate, occupying in all seventy- eight days, or only twelve days short of three months (all in what was supposed to be the favourable season), we had not one single day of fair wind. We were always close braced up, always struggling against wind, tide, and leeway, and in a vessel that would scarcely sail nearer than eight points from the wind. Every seaman will admit that my first voyage in my own boat was a most unlucky one.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Charles Allen had obtained a tolerable collection of birds and insects at Mysol, but far less than be would have done if I had not been so unfortunate as to miss visiting him. After waiting another week or two till he was nearly starved, he returned to Wahai in Ceram, and heard, much to his surprise, that I had left a fortnight before. He was delayed there more than a month before he could get back to the north side of Mysol, which he found a much better locality, but it was not yet the season for the Paradise Birds; and before he had obtained more than a few of the common sort, the last prau was ready to leave for Ternate, and he was obliged to take the opportunity, as he expected I would be waiting there for him.\\nTHE \"KING\" AND THE \"TWELVE WIRED\" BIRDS OF PARADISE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This concludes the record of my wanderings. I next went to Timor, and afterwards to Bourn, Java, and Sumatra, which places have already been described. Charles Allen made a voyage to New Guinea, a short account of which will be given in my next chapter on the Birds of Paradise. On his return he went to the Sula Islands, and made a very interesting collection which served to determine the limits of the zoological group of Celebes, as already explained in my chapter on the natural history of that island. His next journey was to Flores and Solor, where he obtained some valuable materials, which I have used in my chapter on the natural history of the Timor group. He afterwards went to Coti on the east coast of Borneo, from which place I was very anxious to obtain collections, as it is a quite new locality as far as possible from Sarawak, and I had heard very good accounts of it. On his return thence to Sourabaya in Java, he was to have gone to the entirely unknown Sumba or Sandal-wood Island. Most unfortunately, however, he was seized with a terrible fever on his arrival at Coti, and, after lying there some weeks, was taken to Singapore in a very bad condition, where he arrived after I had left for England. When he recovered he obtained employment in Singapore, and I lost his services as a collector.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The three concluding chapters of my work will treat of the birds of Paradise, the Natural History of the Papuan Islands, and the Races of Man in the Malay Archipelago.\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\nTHE BIRDS OF PARADISE\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0AS many of my journeys were made with the express object of obtaining specimens of the Birds of Paradise, and learning something of their habits and distribution; and being (as far as I am aware) the only Englishman who has seen these wonderful birds in their native forests, and obtained specimens of many of them, I propose to give here, in a connected form, the result of my observations and inquiries.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0When the earliest European voyagers reached the Moluccas in search of cloves and nutmegs, which were then rare and precious spices, they were presented with the dried shins of birds so strange and beautiful as to excite the admiration even of those wealth-seeking rovers. The Malay traders gave them the name of \"Manuk dewata,\" or God\\'s birds; and the Portuguese, finding that they had no feet or wings, and not being able to learn anything authentic about then, called them \"Passaros de Col,\" or Birds of the Sun; while the learned Dutchmen, who wrote in Latin, called them \"Avis paradiseus,\" or Paradise Bird. John van Linschoten gives these names in 1598, and tells us that no one has seen these birds alive, for they live in the air, always turning towards the sun, and never lighting on the earth till they die; for they have neither feet nor wings, as, he adds, may be seen by the birds carried to India, and sometimes to Holland, but being very costly they were then rarely seen in Europe. More than a hundred years later Mr. William Funnel, who accompanied Dampier, and wrote an account of the voyage, saw specimens at Amboyna, and was told that they came to Banda to eat nutmegs, which intoxicated them and made them fall down senseless, when they were killed by ants. Down to 1760, when Linnaeus named the largest species, Paradisea apoda (the footless Paradise Bird), no perfect specimen had been seen in Europe, and absolutely nothing was known about them. And even now, a hundred years later, most books state that they migrate annually to Ternate, Banda, and Amboyna; whereas the fact is, that they are as completely unknown in those islands in a wild state as they are in England. Linnaeus was also acquainted with a small species, which he named Paradisea regia (the King Bird of Paradise), and since then nine or ten others have been named, all of which were first described from skins preserved by the savages of New Guinea, and generally more or less imperfect. These are now all known in the Malay Archipelago as \"Burong coati,\" or dead birds, indicating that the Malay traders never saw them alive.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Paradiseidae are a group of moderate-sized birds, allied in their structure and habits to crows, starlings, and to the Australian honeysuckers; but they are characterised by extraordinary developments of plumage, which are unequalled in any other family of birds. In several species large tufts of delicate bright-coloured feathers spring from each side of the body beneath the wings, forming trains, or fans, or shields; and the middle feathers of the tail are often elongated into wires, twisted into fantastic shapes, or adorned with the most brilliant metallic tints. In another set of species these accessory plumes spring from the head, the back, or the shoulders; while the intensity of colour and of metallic lustre displayed by their plumage, is not to be equalled by any other birds, except, perhaps, the humming-birds, and is not surpassed even by these. They have been usually classified under two distinct families, Paradiseidae and Epimachidae, the latter characterised by long and slender beaks, and supposed to be allied to the Hoopoes; but the two groups are so closely allied in every essential point of structure and habits, that I shall consider them as forming subdivisions of one family. I will now give a short description of each of the known species, and then add some general remarks on their natural history.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Great Bird of Paradise (Paradisea apoda of Linnaeus) is the largest species known, being generally seventeen or eighteen inches from the beak to the tip of the tail. The body, wings, and tail are of a rich coffee-brown, which deepens on the breast to a blackish-violet or purple-brown. The whole top of the head and neck is of an exceedingly delicate straw-yellow, the feathers being short and close set, so as to resemble plush or velvet; the lower part of the throat up to the eye clothed with scaly feathers of an emerald, green colour, and with a rich metallic gloss, and velvety plumes of a still deeper green extend in a band across the forehead and chin as far as the eye, which is bright yellow. The beak is pale lead blue; and the feet, which are rather large and very strong and well formed, are of a pale ashy-pink. The two middle feathers of the tail have no webs, except a very small one at the base and at the extreme tip, forming wire-like cirrhi, which spread out in an elegant double curve, and vary from twenty-four to thirty-four inches long. From each side of the body, beneath the wings, springs a dense tuft of long and delicate plumes, sometimes two feet in length, of the most intense golden-orange colour and very glossy, but changing towards the tips into a pale brown. This tuft of plumage cam be elevated and spread out at pleasure, so as almost to conceal the body of the bird.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0These splendid ornaments are entirely confined to the male sex, while the female is really a very plain and ordinary-looking bird of a uniform coffee-brown colour which never changes, neither does she possess the long tail wires, nor a single yellow or green feather about the dead. The young males of the first year exactly resemble the females, so that they can only be distinguished by dissection. The first change is the acquisition of the yellow and green colour on the head and throat, and at the same time the two middle tail feathers grow a few inches longer than the rest, but remain webbed on both sides. At a later period these feathers arc replaced by the long bare shafts of the full length, as in the adult bird; but there is still no sign of the magnificent orange side-plumes, which later still complete the attire of the perfect male. To effect these changes there must be at least three successive moultings; and as the birds were found by me in all the stages about the same time, it is probable that they moult only once a year, and that the full plumage is not acquired till the bird is four years old. It was long thought that the fine train of feathers was assumed for a short time only at the breeding season, but my own experience, as well as the observation of birds of an allied species which I brought home with me, and which lived two years in this country, show that the complete plumage is retained during the whole year, except during a short period of moulting as with most other birds.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Great Bird of Paradise is very active and vigorous and seems to be in constant motion all day long. It is very abundant, small flocks of females and young male being constantly met with; and though the full-plumaged birds are less plentiful, their loud cries, which are heard daily, show that they also are very numerous. Their note is, \"Wawk-wawk-wawk-Wok-wok-wok,\" and is so loud and shrill as to be heard a great distance, and to form the most prominent and characteristic animal sound in the Aru Islands. The mode of nidification is unknown; but the natives told me that the nest was formed of leaves placed on an ant\\'s nest, or on some projecting limb of a very lofty tree, and they believe that it contains only one young bird. The egg is quite unknown, and the natives declared they had never seen it; and a very high reward offered for one by a Dutch official did not meet with success. They moult about January or February, and in May, when they are in full plumage, the males assemble early in the morning to exhibit themselves in the singular manner already described at p. 252. This habit enables the natives to obtain specimens with comparative ease. As soon as they find that the birds have fled upon a tree on which to assemble, they build a little shelter of palm leaves in a convenient place among the branches, and the hunter ensconces himself in it before daylight, armed with his bow and a number of arrows terminating in a round knob. A boy waits at the foot of the tree, and when the birds come at sunrise, and a sufficient number have assembled, and have begun to dance, the hunter shoots with his blunt arrow so strongly as to stun the bird, which drops down, and is secured and killed by the boy without its plumage being injured by a drop of blood. The rest take no notice, and fall one after another till some of them take the alarm. (See Frontispiece.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The native mode of preserving them is to cut off the wings and feet, and then skin the body up to the beak, taking out the skull. A stout stick is then run up through the specimen coming out at the mouth. Round this some leaves are stuffed, and the whole is wrapped up in a palm spathe and dried in the smoky hut. By this plan the head, which is really large, is shrunk up almost to nothing, the body is much reduced and shortened, and the greatest prominence is given to the flowing plumage. Some of these native skins are very clean, and often have wings and feet left on; others are dreadfully stained with smoke, and all hive a most erroneous idea of the proportions of the living bird.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Paradisea apoda, as far as we have any certain knowledge, is confined to the mainland of the Aru Islands, never being found in the smaller islands which surround the central mass. It is certainly not found in any of the parts of New Guinea visited by the Malay and Bugis traders, nor in any of the other islands where Birds of Paradise are obtained. But this is by no means conclusive evidence, for it is only in certain localities that the natives prepare skins, and in other places the same birds may be abundant without ever becoming known. It is therefore quite possible that this species may inhabit the great southern mass of New Guinea, from which Aru has been separated; while its near ally, which I shall next describe, is confined to the north- western peninsula.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Lesser Bird of Paradise (Paradisea papuana of Bechstein), \"Le petit Emeraude\" of French authors, is a much smaller bird than the preceding, although very similar to it. It differs in its lighter brown colour, not becoming darker or purpled on the breast; in the extension of the yellow colour all over the upper part of the back and on the wing coverts; in the lighter yellow of the side plumes, which have only a tinge of orange, and at the tips are nearly pure white; and in the comparative shortness of the tail cirrhi. The female differs remarkably front the same sex in Paradisea apoda, by being entirely white on the under surface of the body, and is thus a much handsomer bird. The young males are similarly coloured, and as they grow older they change to brown, and go through the same stages in acquiring the perfect plumage as has already been described in the allied species. It is this bird which is most commonly used in ladies\\' head-dresses in this country, and also forms an important article of commerce in the East.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Paradisea papuana has a comparatively wide range, being the common species on the mainland of New Guinea, as well as on the islands of Mysol, Salwatty, Jobie, Biak and Sook. On the south coast of New Guinea, the Dutch naturalist, Muller, found it at the Oetanata river in longitude 136° E. I obtained it myself at Dorey; and the captain of the Dutch steamer Etna informed me that he had seen the feathers among the natives of Humboldt Bay, in 141° E. longitude. It is very probable, therefore, that it ranges over the whole of the mainland of New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The true Paradise Birds are omnivorous, feeding on fruits and insects--of the former preferring the small figs; of the latter, grasshoppers, locusts, and phasmas, as well as cockroaches and caterpillars. When I returned home, in 1862, I was so fortunate as to find two adult males of this species in Singapore; and as they seemed healthy, and fed voraciously on rice, bananas, and cockroaches, I determined on giving the very high price asked for them--£100.--and to bring them to England by the overland route under my own care. On my way home I stayed a week at Bombay, to break the journey, and to lay in a fresh stock of bananas for my birds. I had great difficulty, however, in supplying them with insect food, for in the Peninsular and Oriental steamers cockroaches were scarce, and it was only by setting traps in the store-rooms, and by hunting an hour every night in the forecastle, that I could secure a few dozen of these creatures,-- scarcely enough for a single meal. At Malta, where I stayed a fortnight, I got plenty of cockroaches from a bake-house, and when I left, took with me several biscuit-tins\\' full, as provision for the voyage home. We came through the Mediterranean in March, with a very cold wind; and the only place on board the mail-steamer where their large cage could be accommodated was exposed to a strong current of air down a hatchway which stood open day and night, yet the birds never seemed to feel the cold. During the night journey from Marseilles to Paris it was a sharp frost; yet they arrived in London in perfect health, and lived in the Zoological Gardens for one, and two years, often displaying their beautiful plumes to the admiration of the spectators. It is evident, therefore, that the Paradise Birds are very hardy, and require air and exercise rather than heat; and I feel sure that if a good sized conservators` could be devoted to them, or if they could be turned loose in the tropical department of the Crystal Palace or the Great Palm House at Kew, they would live in this country for many years.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Red Bird of Paradise (Paradisea rubra of Viellot), though allied to the two birds already described, is much more distinct from them than they are from each other. It is about the same size as Paradisea papuana (13 to 14 inches long), but differs from it in many particulars. The side plumes, instead of being yellow, are rich crimson, and only extend about three or four inches beyond the end of the tail; they are somewhat rigid, and the ends are curved downwards and inwards, and are tipped with white. The two middle tail feathers, instead of being simply elongated and deprived of their webs, are transformed into stiff black ribands, a quarter of an inch wide, but curved like a split quill, and resembling thin half cylinders of horn or whalebone. When a dead bird is laid on its back, it is seen that these ribands take a curve or set, which brings them round so as to meet in a double circle on the neck of the bird; but when they hang downwards, during life, they assume a spiral twist, and form an exceedingly graceful double curve. They are about twenty-two inches long, and always attract attention as the most conspicuous and extraordinary feature of the species. The rich metallic green colour of the throat extends over the front half of the head to behind the eyes, and on the forehead forms a little double crest of scaly feathers, which adds much to the vivacity of the bird\\'s aspect. The bill is gamboge yellow, and the iris blackish olive. (Figure at p. 353.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The female of this species is of a tolerably uniform coffee-brown colour, but has a blackish head, and the nape neck, and shoulders yellow, indicating the position of the brighter colours of the male. The changes of plumage follow the same order of succession as in the other species, the bright colours of the head and neck being first developed, then the lengthened filaments of the tail, and last of all, the red side plumes. I obtained a series of specimens, illustrating the manner in which the extraordinary black tail ribands are developed, which is very remarkable. They first appear as two ordinary feathers, rather shorter than the rest of the tail; the second stage would no doubt be that shown in a specimen of Paradisea apoda, in which the feathers are moderately lengthened, and with the web narrowed in the middle; the third stage is shown by a specimen which has part of the midrib bare, and terminated by a spatulate web; in another the bare midrib is a little dilated and semi-cylindrical, and the terminal web very small; in a fifth, the perfect black horny riband is formed, but it bears at its extremity a brown spatulate web, while in another a portion of the black riband itself bears, for a portion of its length, a narrow brown web. It is only after these changes are fully completed that the red side plumes begin to appear.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The successive stages of development of the colours and plumage of the Birds of Paradise are very interesting, from the striking manner in which they accord with the theory of their having been produced by the simple action of variation, and the cumulative power of selection by the females, of those male birds which were more than usually ornamental. [footnote: I have since arrived at the conclusion that female selection is not the cause of the development of the ornamental plumes in the males. See my Darwinism, Chap. X.] Variations of _colour_ are of all others the most frequent and the most striking, and are most easily modified and accumulated by man\\'s selection of them. We should expect, therefore, that the sexual differences of _colour_ would be those most early accumulated and fixed, and would therefore appear soonest in the young birds; and this is exactly what occurs in the Paradise Birds. Of all variations in the _form_ of birds\\' feathers, none are so frequent as those in the head and tail. These occur more, or less in every family of birds, and are easily produced in many domesticated varieties, while unusual developments of the feathers of the body are rare in the whole class of birds, and have seldom or never occurred in domesticated species. In accordance with these facts, we find the scale-formed plumes of the throat, the crests of the head, and the long cirrhi of the tail, all fully developed before the plumes which spring from the side of the body begin to mane their appearance. If, on the other hand, the male Paradise Birds have not acquired their distinctive plumage by successive variations, but have been as they are mow from the moment they first appeared upon the earth, this succession becomes at the least unintelligible to us, for we can see no reason why the changes should not take place simultaneously, or in a reverse order to that in which they actually occur.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What is known of the habits of this bird, and the way in which it is captured by the natives, have already been described at page 362.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Red Bird of Paradise offers a remarkable case of restricted range, being entirely confined to the small island of Waigiou, off the north-west extremity of New Guinea, where it replaces the allied species found in the other islands. [footnote: This species is said by Dr. Guillemard to be found also in the island of Batanta. (Cruise of the Marchesa, Vol II, p.225).]\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The three birds just described form a well-marked group, agreeing in every point of general structure, in their comparatively large size, the brown colour of their bodies, wings, and tail, and in the peculiar character of the ornamental  plumage which distinguishes the male bird. The group ranges nearly over the whole area inhabited by the family of the Paradiseidae, but each of the species has its own limited region, and is never found in the same district with either of its close allies. To these three birds properly belongs the generic title Paradisea, or true Paradise Bird. [footnote: Three very distinct new species of Paradisea have since been discovered in Southeastern New Guinea, and two other less distinct local forms.]\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The next species is the Paradisea regia of Linnaeus, or Ding Bird of Paradise, which differs so much from the three preceding species as to deserve a distinct generic name, and it has accordingly been called Cicinnurus regius. By the Malays it is called \"Burong rajah,\" or King Bird, and by the natives of the Aru Islands \"Goby-goby.\"\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This lovely little bird is only about six and a half inches long, partly owing to the very short tail, which does not surpass the somewhat square wings. The head, throat, and entire upper surface are of the richest glossy crimson red, shading to orange-crimson on the forehead, where the feathers extend beyond the nostrils more than half-way down the beak. The plumage is excessively brilliant, shining in certain lights with a metallic or glassy lustre. The breast and belly are pure silky white, between which colour and the red of the throat there is a broad band of rich metallic green, and there is a small spot of the same colour close above each eye. From each side of the body beneath the wing, springs a tuft of broad delicate feathers about an inch and a half long, of an ashy colour, but tipped with a broad band of emerald green, bordered within by a narrow line of buff: These plumes are concealed beneath the wing, but when the bird pleases, can be raised and spread out so as to form an elegant semicircular fan on each shoulder. But another ornament still more extraordinary, and if possible more beautiful, adorns this little bird. The two middle tail feathers are modified into very slender wirelike shafts, nearly six inches long, each of which bears at the extremity, on the inner side only, a web of an emerald green colour, which is coiled up into a perfect spiral disc, and produces a most singular and charming effect. The bill is orange yellow, and the feet and legs of a fine cobalt blue. (See upper figure on the plate at the commencement of this chapter.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The female of this little gem is such a plainly coloured bird, that it can at first sight hardly be believed to belong to the same species. The upper surface is of a dull earthy brown, a slight tinge of orange red appearing only on the margins of the quills. Beneath, it is of a paler yellowish brown, scaled and banded with narrow dusky markings. The young males are exactly like the female, and they no doubt undergo a series of changes as singular as those of Paradisea rubra; but, unfortunately, I was unable to obtain illustrative specimens.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This exquisite little creature frequents the smaller trees in the thickest parts of the forest, feeding on various fruits; often of a very large size for so small a bird. It is very active both on its wings and feet, and makes a whirring sound while flying, something like the South American manakins. It often flutters its wings and displays the beautiful fan which adorns its breast, while the star-bearing tail wires diverge in an elegant double curve. It is tolerably plentiful in the Aru Islands, which led to it, being brought to Europe at an early period along with Paradisea apoda. It also occurs in the island of Mysol and in every part of New Guinea which has been visited by naturalists.\\nTHE MAGNIFICENT BIRD OF PARADISE (Diphyllodes speciosa.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now come to the remarkable little bird called the \"Magnificent,\" first figured by Buffon, and named Paradisea speciosa by Boddaert, which, with one allied species, has been formed into a separate genus by Prince Buonaparte, under the name of Diphyllodes, from the curious double mantle which clothes the back.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The head is covered with short brown velvety feathers, which advance on the back so as to cover the nostrils. From the nape springs a dense mass of feathers of a straw-yellow colour, and about one and a half inches long, forming a mantle over the upper part of the back. Beneath this, and forming a band about one- third of an inch beyond it, is a second mantle of rich, glossy, reddish-brown fathers. The rest of the bath is orange-brown, the tail-coverts and tail dark bronzy, the wings light orange-buff: The whole under surface is covered with an abundance of plumage springing from the margins of the breast, and of a rich deep green colour, with changeable hues of purple. Down the middle of the breast is a broad band of scaly plumes of the same colour, while the chin and throat are of a rich metallic bronze. From the middle of the tail spring two narrow feathers of a rich steel blue, and about ten inches long. These are webbed on the inner side only, and curve outward, so as to form a double circle.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0From what we know of the habits of allied species, we may be sure that the greatly developed plumage of this bird is erected and displayed in some remarkable manner. The mass of feathers on the under surface are probably expanded into a hemisphere, while the beautiful yellow mantle is no doubt elevated so as to give the bird a very different appearance from that which it presents in the dried and flattened skins of the natives, through which alone it is at present known. The feet appear to be dark blue.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This rare and elegant little bird is found only on the mainland of New Guinea, and in the island of Mysol.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A still more rare and beautiful species than the last is the Diphyllodes wilsoni, described by Mr. Cassin from a native skin in the rich museum of Philadelphia. The same bird was afterwards named \"Diphyllodes respublica\" by Prince Buonaparte, and still later, \"Schlegelia calva,\" by Dr. Bernstein, who was so fortunate as to obtain fresh specimens in Waigiou.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In this species the upper mantle is sulphur yellow, the lower one and the wings pure red, the breast plumes dark green, and the lengthened middle tail feathers much shorter than in the allied species. The most curious difference is, however, that the top of the head is bald, the bare skin being of a rich cobalt blue, crossed by several lines of black velvety feathers.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is about the same size as Diphyllodes speciosa, and is no doubt entirely confined to the island of Waigiou. The female, as figured and described by Dr. Bernstein, is very like that of Cicinnurus regius, being similarly banded beneath; and we may therefore conclude that its near ally, the \"Magnificent,\" is at least equally plain in this sex, of which specimens have not yet been obtained.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Superb Bird of Paradise was first figured by Buffon, and was named by Boddaert, Paradisea atra, from the black ground colour of its plumage. It forms the genus Lophorina of Viellot, and is one of the rarest and most brilliant of the whole group, being only known front mutilated native skins. This bird is a little larger than the Magnificent. The ground colour of the plumage is intense black, but with beautiful bronze reflections on the neck, and the whole head scaled with feathers of brilliant metallic green and blue. Over its breast it bears a shield formed of narrow and rather stiff feathers, much elongated towards the sides, of a pure bluish-green colour, and with a satiny gloss. But a still more extraordinary ornament is that which springs from the back of the neck,--a shield of a similar form to that on the breast, but much larger, and of a velvety black colour, glossed with bronze and purple. The outermost feathers of this shield are half an inch longer than the wing, and when it is elevated it must, in conjunction with the breast shield, completely change the form and whole appearance of the bird. The bill is black, and the feet appear to be yellow.\\nTHE SUPERB BIRD OF PARADISE (Lophorina atra.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This wonderful little bird inhabits the interior of the northern peninsula of New Guinea only. Neither I nor Mr. Allen could hear anything of it in any of the islands or on any part of the coast. It is true that it was obtained from the coast-natives by Lesson; but when at Sorong in 1861, Mr. Allen learnt that it is only found three days\\' journey in the interior. Owing to these \"Black Birds of Paradise,\" as they are called, not being so much valued as articles of merchandise, they now seem to be rarely preserved by the natives, and it thus happened that during several years spent on the coasts of New Guinea and in the Moluccas I was never able to obtain a skin. We are therefore quite ignorant of the habits of this bird, and also of its female, though the latter is no doubt as plain and inconspicuous as in all the other species of this family.\\nTHE SIX-SHAFTED BIRD OF PARADISE (Parotia sexpennis.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Golden, or Six-shafted, Paradise Bird, is another rare species, first figured by Buffon, and never yet obtained in perfect condition. It was named by Boddaert, Paradisea sexpennis, and forms the genus Parotia of Viellot. This wonderful bird is about the size of the female Paradisea rubra. The plumage appear, at first sight black, but it glows in certain light with bronze and deep purple. The throat and breast are scaled with broad flat feathers of an intense golden hue, changing to green and blue tints in certain lights. On the back of the head is a broad recurved band of feathers, whose brilliancy is indescribable, resembling the sheen of emerald and topaz rather than any organic substance. Over the forehead is a large patch of pure white feathers, which shine like satin; and from the sides of the head spring the six wonderful feathers from which the bird receives its name. These are slender wires, six inches long, with a small oval web at the extremity. In addition to these ornaments, there is also an immense tuft of soft feathers on each side of the breast, which when elevated must entirely hide the wings, and give the bird au appearance of being double its real bulk. The bill is black, short, and rather compressed, with the feathers advancing over the nostrils, as in Cicinnurus regius. This singular and brilliant bird inhabits the same region as the Superb Bird of Paradise, and nothing whatever is known about it but what we can derive from an examination of the skins preserved by the natives of New Guinea.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Standard Wing, named Semioptera wallacei by Mr. G. R. Gray, is an entirely new form of Bird of Paradise, discovered by myself in the island of Batchian, and especially distinguished by a pair of long narrow feathers of a white colour, which spring from among the short plumes which clothe the bend of the wing, and are capable of being erected at pleasure. The general colour of this bird is a delicate olive-brown, deepening to a loud of bronzy olive in the middle of the back, and changing to a delicate ashy violet with a metallic gloss, on the crown of the head. The feathers, which cover the nostrils and extend half-way down the beak, are loose and curved upwards. Beneath, it is much more beautiful. The scale-like feathers of the breast are margined with rich metallic blue-green, which colour entirely covers the throat and sides of the neck, as well as the long pointed plumes which spring from the sides of the breast, and extend nearly as far as the end of the wings. The most curious feature of the bird, however, and one altogether unique in the whole class, is found in the pair of long narrow delicate feathers which spring from each wing close to the bend. On lifting the wing-coverts they are seen to arise from two tubular horny sheaths, which diverge from near the point of junction of the carpal bones. As already described at p. 41, they are erectile, and when the bird is excited are spread out at right angles to the wing and slightly divergent. They are from six to six and a half inches long, the upper one slightly exceeding the lower. The total length of the bird is eleven inches. The bill is horny olive, the iris deep olive, and the feet bright orange.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The female bird is remarkably plain, being entirely of a dull pale earthy brown, with only a slight tinge of ashy violet on the head to relieve its general monotony; and the young males exactly resemble her. (See figures at p. 41.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This bird, frequents the lower trees of the forests, and, like most Paradise Birds, is in constant motion--flying from branch to branch, clinging to the twigs and even to the smooth and vertical trunks almost as easily as a woodpecker. It continually utters a harsh, creaking note, somewhat intermediate between that of Paradisea apoda, and the more musical cry of Cicinnurus regius. The males at short intervals open and flutter their wings, erect the long shoulder feathers, and spread out the elegant green breast shields.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Standard Wing is found in Gilolo as well as in Batchian, and all the specimens from the former island have the green breast shield rather longer, the crown of the head darker violet, and the lower parts of the body rather more strongly scaled with green. This is the only Paradise Bird yet found in the Moluccan district, all the others being confined to the Papuan Islands and North Australia.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We now come to the Epimachidae, or Long-billed Birds of Paradise, which, as before stated, ought not to be separated from the Paradiseidae by the intervention of any other birds. One of the most remarkable of these is the Twelve-wired Paradise Bird, Paradises alba of Blumenbach, but now placed in the genus Seleucides of Lesson.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This bird is about twelve inches long, of which the compressed and curved beak occupies two inches. The colour of the breast and upper surface appears at first sight nearly black, but a close examination shows that no part of it is devoid of colour; and by holding it in various lights, the most rich and glowing tints become visible. The head, covered with short velvety feathers, which advance on the chic much further than on the upper part of the beak, is of a purplish bronze colour; the whole of the back and shoulders is rich bronzy green, while the closed wings and tail are of the most brilliant violet purple, all the plumage having a delicate silky gloss. The mass of feathers which cover the breast is really almost black, with faint glosses of green and purple, but their outer edges are margined with glittering bands of emerald green. The whole lower part of the body is rich buffy yellow, including the tuft of plumes which spring from the sides, and extend an inch and a half beyond the tail. When skins are exposed to the light the yellow fades into dull white, from which circumstance it derived its specific name. About six of the innermost of these plumes on each side have the midrib elongated into slender black wires, which bend at right angles, and curve somewhat backwards to a length of about ten inches, forming one of those extraordinary and fantastic ornaments with which this group of birds abounds. The bill is jet black, and the feet bright yellow. (See lower figure on the plate at the beginning of this chapter).\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The female, although not quite so plain a bird as in some other species, presents none of the gay colours or ornamental plumage of the male. The top of the head and back of the neck are black, the rest of the upper parts rich reddish brown; while the under surface is entirely yellowish ashy, somewhat blackish on the breast, and crossed throughout with narrow blackish wavy bands.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Seleucides alba is found in the island of Salwatty, and in the north-western parts of New Guinea, where it frequents flowering trees, especially sago-palms and pandani, sucking the flowers, round and beneath which its unusually large and powerful feet enable it to cling. Its motions are very rapid. It seldom rests more than a few moments on one tree, after which it flies straight off, and with great swiftness, to another. It has a loud shrill cry, to be heard a long way, consisting of \"Cah, cah,\" repeated five or six times in a descending scale, and at the last note it generally flies away. The males are quite solitary in their habits, although, perhaps, they assemble at pertain times like the true Paradise Birds. All the specimens shot and opened by my assistant Mr. Allen, who obtained this fine bird during his last voyage to New Guinea, had nothing in their stomachs but a brown sweet liquid, probably the nectar of the flowers on which they had been feeding. They certainly, however, eat both fruit and insects, for a specimen which I saw alive on board a Dutch steamer ate cockroaches and papaya fruit voraciously. This bird had the curious habit of resting at noon with the bill pointing vertically upwards. It died on the passage to Batavia, and I secured the body and formed a skeleton, which shows indisputably that it is really a Bird of Paradise. The tongue is very long and extensible, but flat and little fibrous at the end, exactly like the true Paradiseas.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the island of Salwatty, the natives search in the forests till they find the sleeping place of this bird, which they know by seeing its dung upon the ground. It is generally in a low bushy tree. At night they climb up the trap, and either shoot the birds with blunt arrows, or even catch them alive with a cloth. In New Guinea they are caught by placing snares on the trees frequented by them, in the same way as the Red Paradise birds are caught in Waigiou, and which has already been described at page 362.\\nTHE LONG-TAILED BIRD OF PARADISE (Epimachus magnus.)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The great Epimaque, or Long-tailed Paradise Bird (Epimachus magnus), is another of these wonderful creatures, only known by the imperfect skins prepared by the natives. In its dark velvety plumage, glowed with bronze and purple, it resembles the Seleucides alba, but it bears a magnificent tail more than two feet long, glossed on the upper surface with the most intense opalescent blue. Its chief ornament, however, consists in the group of broad plumes which spring from the sides of the breast, and which are dilated at the extremity, and banded with the most vivid metallic blue and green. The bill is long and curved, and the feet black, and similar to those of the allied forms. The total length of this fine bird is between three and four feet.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This splendid bird inhabits the mountains of New Guinea, in the same district with the Superb and the Six-shafted Paradise Birds, and I was informed is sometimes found in the ranges near the coast. I was several times assured by different natives that this bird makes its nest in a hole under ground, or under rocks, always choosing a place with two apertures, so that it may enter at one and go out at the other. This is very unlike what we should suppose to be the habits of the bird, but it is not easy to conceive how the story originated if it is not true; and all travellers know that native accounts of the habits of animals, however strange they may seem, almost invariably turn out to be correct.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Scale-breasted Paradise Bird (Epimachus magnificus of Cuvier) is now generally placed with the Australian Rifle birds in the genus Ptiloris. Though very beautiful, these birds are less strikingly decorated with accessory plumage than the other species we have been describing, their chief ornament being a more or less developed breastplate of stiff metallic green feathers, and a small tuft of somewhat hairy plumes on the sides of the breast. The back and wings of this species are of an intense velvety black, faintly glossed in certain lights with rich purple. The two broad middle tail feathers are opalescent green-blue with a velvety surface, and the top of the head is covered with feathers resembling scales of burnished steel. A large triangular space covering the chin, throat, and breast, is densely scaled with feathers, having a steel-blue or green lustre, and a silky feel. This is edged below with a narrow band of black, followed by shiny bronzy green, below which the body is covered with hairy feathers of a rich claret colour, deepening to black at the tail. The tufts of side plumes somewhat resemble those of the true Birds of Paradise, but are scanty, about as long as the tail, and of a black colour. The sides of the head are rich violet, and velvety feathers extend on each side of the beak over the nostrils.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I obtained at Dorey a young male of this bird, in a state of plumage which is no doubt that of the adult female, as is the case in all the allied species. The upper surface, wings, and tail are rich reddish brown, while the under surface is of a pale ashy colour, closely barred throughout with narrow wavy black bands. There is also a pale banded stripe over the eye, and a long dusky stripe from the gape down each side of the neck. This bird is fourteen inches long, whereas the native skins of the adult male are only about ten inches, owing to the way in which the tail is pushed in, so as to give as much prominence as possible to the ornamental plumage of the breast.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At Cape York, in North Australia, there is a closely allied species, Ptiloris alberti, the female of which is very similar to the young male bird here described. The beautiful Rifle Birds of Australia, which much resemble those Paradise Birds, are named Ptiloris paradiseus and Ptiloris victories, The Scale-breasted Paradise Bird seems to be confined to the mainland of New Guinea, and is less rare than several of the other species.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There are three other New Guinea birds which are by some authors classed with the Birds of Paradise, and which, being almost equally remarkable for splendid plumage, deserve to be noticed here. The first is the Paradise pie (Astrapia nigra of Lesson), a bird of the size of Paradises rubra, but with a very long tail, glossed above with intense violet. The back is bronzy black, the lower parts green, the throat and neck bordered with loose broad feathers of an intense coppery hue, while on the top of the head and neck they are glittering emerald green, All the plumage round the head is lengthened and erectile, and when spread out by the living bird must lave an effect hardly surpassed by any of the true Paradise birds. The bill is black and the feet yellow. The Astrapia seems to me to be somewhat intermediate between the Paradiseidae and Epimachidae.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There is an allied species, having a bare carunculated head, which has been called Paradigalla carunculata. It is believed to inhabit, with the preceding, the mountainous, interior of New Guinea, but is exceedingly rare, the only known specimen being in the Philadelphia Museum.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Paradise Oriole is another beautiful bird, which is now sometimes classed with the Birds of Paradise. It has been named Paradises aurea and Oriolus aureus by the old naturalists, and is now generally placed in the same genus as the Regent Bird of Australia (Sericulus chrysocephalus). But the form of the bill and the character of the plumage seem to me to be so different that it will have to form a distinct genus. This bird is almost entirely yellow, with the exception of the throat, the tail, and part of the wings and back, which are black; but it is chiefly characterised by a quantity of long feathers of an intense glossy orange colour, which cover its neck down to the middle of the back, almost like the hackles of a game-cock.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This beautiful bird inhabits the mainland of New Guinea, and is also found in Salwatty, but is so rare that I was only able to obtain one imperfect native skin, and nothing whatever is known of its habits.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I will now give a list of all the Birds of Paradise yet known, with the places they are believed to inhabit.\\nPARADISEA APODA (The Great Paradise Bird).

      "[1.1386552408509952e-05, 'Eleno O. Peralta [30]\\nABSTRACT\\nDeforestation has taken on alarming proportions in the Philippines during the post Second World War decades, and it is now among the six countries that account for three-quarters of recent deforestation in the region. The Philippine government has formulated the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) for 2001- 2004 of which a key component is the Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM), a national strategy in managing the forestlands resources and seeks to address the interlinked problem of forest destruction and upland poverty. While forestry research in the Philippines is handled principally by government research agencies, there are also non-governmental organizations (NGO) and academe-based research institutions that conduct various related researches. The Forestry Development Center (FDC) based at the College of Forestry and Natural Resources (CFNR) of the University of the Philippines at Los Baños, was established to conduct basic policy researches in forestry and develop, or help develop, an effective machinery for forestry policy formulation and implementation. In view of changing demands for research on poverty reduction, especially in the uplands, the research thrusts of FDC have shifted to focus on areas such as improvement of the socio-economic well-being of the upland farmers and harnessing forests for poverty eradication.\\nTHE PHILIPPINE FORESTRY SECTOR\\nThe Philippines has a total land area of slightly less than 30 million ha. From a high of 21 million ha in 1900 (70 percent of land area), the country\\'s forest cover was reduced to 5.5 million ha in 1999 (18.3 percent). Deforestation has taken on alarming proportions in the Philippines during the post Second World War decades. The scenario for 2010 has been described as \"nothing short of disastrous\" with the country\\'s forest cover reaching a low of 6.6 percent of the total land area.\\nThe UN Commission on Sustainable Development through the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF) identified the following causes: poverty, lack of secure land tenure patterns, inadequate recognition of the rights and needs of forest-dependent indigenous and local communities within national laws and jurisdiction, inadequate cross-sectoral policies, lack of participation, lack of good governance, absence of supportive economic climate that supports sustainable forest management, lack of capacity, among other factors. These are the same factors contributing to the massive destruction of the forests during the past two decades: the tremendous pressure from an increasing population in search of land; ever increasing demand of fuelwood; the over-exploitation of timber resources; and inadequate forest development, management and conservation efforts. Consequently, soil degradation due to massive conversion of forestlands and grasslands to urban use and increased cultivation in upland areas remains a big problem. It was estimated that 45 percent of the country\\'s total land area suffers from moderate to severe soil erosion, most of which is still unabated (MTPDP 2001- 2004).\\nMeanwhile, poor rural households have increased with the poverty incidence at a high 28.4 percent in 2000. This means that more than one-third of the country\\'s population is living below the poverty line (MTPDP 2001-2004). Aggravating the problem is the observation that rural income distribution has worsened with nearly 50 percent of rural income being accounted for by the upper one-fifth of rural households in 1997 (MIPDP 2001-2004).\\nTo remedy the above situation, the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) for 2001- 2004 intends to promote sustainable management and use of its natural resources. To achieve this goal, the government will use four key strategies: (a) environmental sustainability; (b) broader participation of stakeholders in the management and protection of natural resources and environment; (c) equitable access to productive resources and services; and (d) technology-based production in the forestry and natural resources sectors.\\nA key component of the MTPDP is the Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM), which is the national strategy in managing the forest resources and seeks to address the interlinked problem of forest destruction and upland poverty. Based on current estimates, there are about 20 million Filipinos living in the uplands most of which had been characterized to be of low forest cover. This is based on the concept of \"people first and sustainable forestry will follow\" wherein upland communities are empowered to directly manage and benefit from the forest resources entrusted to them. The hypothesis is that when the issues of poverty and inequitable access to resources in the uplands are addressed, local community itself will join hands in protecting and managing the forest because it has an important stake on the resources.\\nThe CBFM programme has the following objectives:\\nSustainable management of forest and resources\\nSocial justice and improved well-being of the local communities\\nStrong partnership among local communities and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).\\nThe DENR is the primary government agency responsible in the sustainable development of the country\\'s natural resources and ecosystems. In implementing the CBFM programme, the DENR is guided by the following essential features:\\nSecurity of tenure in the form of long-term tenure and usufructuary instruments\\nSocial equity by giving enough access to the natural endowments of the area, and internally through equitable benefit-sharing arrangements among the members of the people\\'s organizations\\nStrong partnership between the national government agency and the local government units to ensure local support to the programme.\\nInvestment capital and market linkages to sustain the increased economic conditions of the upland community without necessarily exhausting the natural resources in the area.\\nThese very recent developments bring into focus the role of research and development institutions in the Asia-Pacific region in supplying the relevant information and research results for a clear understanding of the sustainable forest resource management-poverty reduction nexus. This is very important particularly for low forest cover but high upland population countries like the Philippines where the challenge of the natural resources governance has always been to uplift the socio-economic well-being of the upland people and at the same time maintain the health of its environment and natural resources systems.\\nFORESTRY RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES\\nAt present, state-sponsored forestry research in the Philippines is handled principally by DENR through its Ecosystem Research and Development Bureau (ERDB), and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through the research consortia being coordinated by the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD).\\nAt the same time, there are non-governmental organizations (NGO) and academe-based research institutions that conduct various researches in support of their respected mandate. One of these academe-based research institutions is the Forestry Development Center (FDC), which is based at the College of Forestry and Natural Resources (CFNR), University of the Philippines, Los Baños, College, Laguna. The FDC was established under Presidential Decree No. 1559 issued in 1978 to conduct basic policy researches in forestry and develop, or help develop, an effective machinery for forestry policy formulation and implementation. Its objectives include:\\nGeneration of information/data on forestry related areas of concern\\nConduct of basic forest policy and related researches relevant to changing national priorities, goal and objectives\\nAdvocate policy reforms, which will enhance forestry development in particular and national development in general\\nPromote healthy discussion of policy reforms and critical development issues in forestry among sectors concerned.\\nPromote the publication and dissemination of forestry policy information.\\nIt employs three main approaches, namely:\\nPolicy research and studies in the following areas: social forestry, environmental forestry and biodiversity, sustainable forest resources development.\\nForums wherein the FDC facilitates free and open discussion and experience of ideas through seminars, symposiums, conference, workshop and round-table talks for deeper analyses of environmental policies and issues for further reforms.\\nInformation dissemination through publications such as policy papers, occasional papers, seminar/ workshop proceedings, bibliographies of forestry and environmental laws/regulations.\\nIn view of the changing demands for relevant research on poverty reduction programmes and strategies anchored on the natural endowments of the country, specifically in the uplands, research thrusts of the FDC and other academe-based research institutions will now have to focus on the following:\\nImpact studies of existing forestry programmes particularly on the improvement of the socio-economic well-being of the upland farmers - There must be a conscious effort to determine whether existing development programmes in the uplands are really giving significant benefits to the poor on a sustained basis. In this regard, the FDC has conducted a series of assessments of both the bio-physical and socio-institutional components of the country\\'s Community-Based Forest Management programme based on the targets agreed upon by the upland community and the government over a given area. This kind of research will disclose the impact of the development programme both on the forest and on the upland community. The data to be generated from this kind of research will be useful as cross-reference if indeed the country is on track with its commitment to reduce the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by at least one-half by 2015.\\nPolicy advocacy to push the adoption of relevant policies at all levels geared towards harnessing forests for poverty eradication in the uplands - An indispensable prerequisite to sustain the contribution of forests to the eradication of poverty in the uplands is the presence of enabling policy system. The research institution should therefore be concerned not only in the generation and interpretation of data but also in translating research results into hard policies, then be able to advocate for the formal adoption of these policies on a broader scale. This activity requires different expertise and methodology but remains a critical phase in the overall objective of establishing an enabling policy environment to eradicate poverty in the uplands using the forest resources. In the Philippines, the College of Forestry and Natural Resources, through the FDC, is very active in undertaking forest policy advocacy work. This is done by lobbying with lawmakers for the passage of laws affecting the natural resources sector, participating in important deliberations of proposed laws and even administrative issuance and submitting policy proposals for consideration of the policy makers.\\nCapacity building of upland community - There are plenty of researchers on new technologies that would improve crop yields both in terms of volume and quality. The challenge is to bring these technologies to the doorstep of the upland farmer so that he can use them in his farm. This is one role which research institutions should give equal importance because no matter how good the technology is on paper if it is not being employed for the benefit of the upland farmers, then it has no extrinsic value at all. Trainings and information and education campaigns must therefore become integral components of the research programme of R & D institutions to ensure that the results of their researches and studies are applied at the grassroots level. The research institution in effect acts as transferor of practical technology direct to the end users.\\nCoalition formation - Since sustainable forest management and poverty are both multi-dimensional in nature, R & D institutions should endeavour to join their efforts to take advantage of their respective talents, disciplinary strengths and resources. This strategy enables more integrated research programme among research institutions having complementary interests either on poverty eradication in the uplands or sustainable forest resource management. It will also strengthen the policy advocacy work designed towards the formal adoption of policy reforms resulting from researches and studies.\\nThe FDC is currently applying this approach in promoting the formal adoption of the Philippine Strategy for Improved Watershed Resources Management (PSIWRW). By convening an annual national watershed forum, almost all water-related agencies of the government, the private sector and civil society are gathered round the table. In the process, albeit informally, a coalition could be formed composed of these water-related agencies and institutions that could be mobilized for a concerted action in the future. In similar fashion, all the major agencies and institutions concerned with poverty eradication and sustainable forest resources management could organize themselves into a coalition that will advance their common objective of eradicating poverty through the sustainable management of forest resources.\\nLaying the scientific basis for policy making - Policy-makers rely much on empirical evidence to support their policy initiatives. Oftentimes though, this relationship is missing such that research institutions continue to undertake research for the sake of research. At the other end, policy initiatives lack a solid foundation because these are not backed up by scientific data resulting in policy stalemate. Given this common situation in the Philippines and perhaps in many developing countries, academe-based research institutions could employ a proactive stance by configuring their research programmes along the country\\'s macro-development plans and national policy agenda on poverty eradication and sustainable forest resources management. The finding of these aligned researches and studies would then be immensely relevant and valuable to the policy process of the government. In essence, the research institutions act as clearing house for information processing in support of policy making.\\nFor example, although nobody will argue the need to eradicate poverty in the uplands and at the same time, sustainably manage the forest resources there, the scientific predicate that would articulate the specifics of this relationship may not yet be ready. As a result, the passage of policies that would capture the ramifications of sustainable forest resource management and poverty eradication in the uplands could not catch the imagination of the public. This is the case in the Philippines where the country\\'s main forest policy is already about 27 years old and amendments tabled remains pending for many reasons. One of which is the lack of snowballed public clamour towards approval. This lack of public support could be a function of the inability of the country\\'s research institutions to articulate with conviction the scientific foundation of the pending amendments.\\nDeconstruct conventional theories on the environment-poverty nexus - The research institutions should now look more closely at the validity of conventional theories surrounding the so-called environment-poverty nexus. For a long time, the tenet is that population growth will lead to environmental degradation because of poverty. This is unfairly blaming the upland farmers for the sorry state of the uplands. There is a need to review those conventional assumptions and come up with new ideas on how to solve the problem of poverty in the uplands. For example, in the CBFM programme that is being assessed by the FDC, one of the areas where the researchers are interested in relates to the non-forest-based employment opportunities of the upland farmers. The idea is to determine if the uplifting of at least the economic status of the upland farmers could be successfully detached from the forest resources existing in the area. If this is possible then the twin objectives of forest protection and economic growth in the upland community could be achieved through the programme.\\nProvide empirical evidence towards the design of academic programmes built on the philosophy that integrates poverty eradication and forest conservation - It is high time that poverty eradication and forest conservation is placed in the centre of academic discussion so that future practitioners will be equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and right attitude towards this human endeavour. Research institutions could immensely help influence the development of this kind of academic programmes owing to their rich database on the intimate link between poverty and natural resources and the consequent dynamics that emerge from this interaction. The advantage of academe-based research institutions is that they are organized and working within an academic community and this set-up gives them access to the planning and revision of academic programmes. Furthermore, the researchers are frequently seconded to teach or guide graduate studies and this gives these researchers adequate opportunities to convey the results of their researches to the faculty and students.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn its policy brief entitled \"How forests can reduce poverty\", the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) presented an agenda for action composed of four major components on how trees, forests and forestry can contribute towards increasing food security and reducing poverty:\\nStrengthening rights, capabilities and governance - This component requires three strategies, namely: (a) support the poor\\'s own decision-making power; (b) strengthen forest rights of the poor and the means to claim them; and (c) recognize links between forestry and local governance.\\nReducing vulnerability - This is achieved by: (a) make safely nets not poverty traps; (b) support tree planting outside forests; (c) cut the regulatory burden on the poor and make regulation affordable; and (d) reduce unfair obligations in forest management.\\nCapturing emerging opportunities - This involves four key strategies: (a) remove the barriers to market entry; (b) base land use decisions on true value of forests; (c) ensure that markets for environmental services benefit the poor; and (d) support associations and financing for local forest businesses.\\nWorking in partnership - Strategies under this component are: (a) simplify policies and support participatory processes; (b) promote multisectoral learning and action; (c) enhance interagency collaboration and (d) make NGOs and the private sector partners in poverty reduction.\\nThis four-point agenda for action presents a very good opportunity for academe-based research institutions to give a significant contribution to the global programme of poverty eradication using forest resources. Each of the strategies identified in this four-point agenda for action is a critical research area wherein academe-based institutions could innovate and seek their changed roles. As stressed in the World Development Report 2003, of the many interrelated drivers of socio-economic change and transformation, scientific and technological innovation is the first. Logically therefore, research institutions should be at the forefront in finding ways and means of combating poverty in the uplands.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\nAnonymous. 1978.
